FINAL 

What I wanted to do with this problem set is give the idea of a persons face painted as a pig, all of my variables depend on the persons skin tone, eye colour, face shape, gender and bone structure to determine how that face would look with face paint on.

For my final update I've got 9 variables that can be changed to give the face identity. this is how it works:
	-Depending on the persons skintone the shade of their cheeks changes, the lighter the skin tone the pinker the cheeks, the darker the skintone, the yellower the cheeks.
	-Depending on the gender the nose changes, Men tend to have stronger noses while the females have smaller noses.
	-Depending on the skin tone and eye colour the whites of the eyes change, the lighter the skintone, the whiter the eyes.
	-Eye colour changes to match the persons.
	-Colour of the eyebrows change to match the hair colour, the darker the hair the darker the brows.
	-If its a female they posses make up, if they are males they dont.
	-Females have red-er lips while the males have blacker lips.
	-The darker the skin tone the red-er the 'face paint'.
	-Depending on the persons smile and cheek bones the cheeks change possition.

 For my images I have Frank Oz who was the original voice of Ms. Piggy, Christina Ricci who playes Penelope in Penelope the Film, Christina Cavanaugh who voices Babe. I also have a shot from the Muppets film featuring Ms Piggy and a crowd of people, Dakota Fanning in Charlottes Web, Actors from Charlotts Web and Ricky Gervais with Ms Piggy at the Muppets premiere. I've chosen all these photos since the star of my project is the Pig, so picking actors who voiced pigs or acted along side them seemed like the best way to display my work.

 Overall I think I've achieved what I wanted with this project and have been able to portray the idea of face paint onto people.
