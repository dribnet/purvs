This is a program that maps attributes of faces in images onto parameterized mummy¡¯s faces. 

At the beginning of this problem set, I simply transfer the features of mummy face from my problem set one. As I refined the shape of my faces to be better illustrate the identities of original faces, I realized there is not enough variations of shapes to show all the data. I started to experiment different colours and shapes on my faces. The colours of lips and hair and the length of hair make the face much easier to identify in quiz mode. The face ends up with a funky look after adding all these features. In order to maintain the overall colour theme for different settings, the colour ranges are limited to a specific values and the controllers only change the brightness.

I chose to use the images of politicians to create a strong contrast with the funky look of the faces.
