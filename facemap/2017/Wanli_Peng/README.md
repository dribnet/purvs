## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

For this project I based off the fire character Calcifer from Howl's Moving Castle and reiterated it. The fire is slightly animated and there is now a white part in the eye to show more life in the character. My chosen images relate to dance because I wanted to highlight the elegant, joyful movement from the fire. I wanted to emphasise some subtle dynamic element in my work. If I were to spend more time on this project I would pick out an image with a wide variety of faces to show the various colours that I have mapped. 

The parameterised values include: fire colour (RGB), hair opacity, hair length, skin opacity, skin saturation, eye hue and eye brightness. The more transparent the hair part of the fire is the, darker the hair it is meant to represent. To make the faces more different from each other I now made the top face colour (the skin colour) a set colour which is controlled with in saturation and opacity levels according to the imageâ€™s skin colour. This is more effective as it is now more distinguishable against the hair colour.

The hair height on the fire depends on the visable length of the hair on the image. I think this is very affective and definately helps differentiate between the faces better.
