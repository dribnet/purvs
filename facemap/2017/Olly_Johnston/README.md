## PS2 MDDN 342 2017


Adding my own images for the final hand in. I have decided to use an image of Arnold Schwarzenegger as he was the terminator, Robert Patrick as he was the T1000 and Donald Trump and his son as it's always fun to mock the president by giving him a funny face.'

I am pretty happy with how my robot face has turned out. I believe that the basic geometric shape was quite hard to work with when mapping onto real faces and if I was to start the project again I perhaps would have experimented with a new face.

I tried to have my final composition include just the images FaceMap: 0, 1 and 2 but for some unknown reason the other images have also appeared.
