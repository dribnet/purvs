My design for Project 2 I decided to continue to use Spongebob from project 1, and customized it to match a human face. I had to tone down his eyes to fit the look of a human face shape more. To add to the different perspectives of the faces I added in the nose which faces forward, left or right depending on the direction the face is looking to help give my design some depth. 

I decided to use variables that weren't tied to the landmark mapping for the slider values, as this would give me the best amount of customization for each face for the quizzes. Color wasn't added as a slider value as I still wanted the color to linked back to spongebob as a lot of other features had to be changed to be more human like than spongebob like.
