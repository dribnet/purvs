README part 1:
It was fairly simple to copy my code through to the base face code. I had a little problem with the background, since it was made in sketch.js rather than the face code.

README part 2:
Moving my style from the first faces to real faces was going to be hard, but it was a lot easier than expected. It took a little while to figure out how to map other things to the points, but it works.

README part 3&4:
Added sliders, removed unused sliders. I added hairLength (which doesn't actually work with training since it just picks stuff from face maps) to give the faces a little variety. X and Y scale values essentially multiply the distance of the eyes from the hair on top and the hair on the sides.

README part 5:
I like how the faces turned out, more often than not they got the hair colour right anyway. The nose is the best part, with the lines recognisably moving off the face.
