For the first part I chose to take homer's face from the first promblem set and objectify it. It has variables such as tiltvalue, which changes how much the face is tilted. The second varibale is eyevalue which controls which direction homer's eyes are looking in, the third varable is mouthvalue which controls the shape homer makes with his mouth. The final variable is hairvalue which controls the number of hairs on homer's head.I chose the blue background as it is a complementary colour to homer's skin so looks nice, while providing contrast.

For the second part I decided to move away from the simpsons as I felt the faces were too restricting and did not allow enougth room to take parameters from the faces of real people. This was due to a couple of factors the first being the side on oritation that I originally created them in. The second being the fact the shape of the mouth and nose couldn;t really take much data from the faces other than position.

So I decided to base my design on Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot. For the training I took the length of the hair and colour of the hair. These values affects the lenght of his feathers and the colour of his beard.
