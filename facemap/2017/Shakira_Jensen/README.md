FINAL README

For this project I tried to maintain the faces I created in project 1. The key elements to the first project were the eyes (which were interchangeable), the skin tone/colour, and the sketchy random lines featured on all the faces. To translate this to project 2 I created 3 types of eyes with varying eye colours and a sketchy outline/mouth/nose, while also maintaining most of the original colour scheme.  

When this was positioned on a realistic human face it took the form of a mask. This mask appeared really creepy, almost as if there was an AI/alien underneath trying to appear like a human in order to take over society. It was for this reason I chose the faces for the face map view to be those of famous people from the 70’s (if I was an AI I would want to me Freddie Mercury too). 

Through the training mode I mapped the faces with the following rules:
	Eye type 1 was matched with blondes.
	Eye type 2 was matched with brunettes/black hair.
	Eye type 3 was all other hair colours.
	Pupil size matches how wide open their eyes are.
I tried to keep they eye colour natural (except for those with brown eyes who matched with purple).
	Girls always have sketchy/wiry outlines.
	Boys have less sketchy/wiry outlines.
	I tried to keep the cheek size matching how wide they were smiling.

When these settings are applied to any face image a variety of combinations can occur. The computer guesses really well which gender should get which sort of outline, however struggle with eye colour.
