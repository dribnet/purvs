## PS2 MDDN 342 2017


This is the final README for this project. At this moment, most aspects of the project are done. There are things that are not though.

Fot the face, I decided to go faceon instead of side on and use parameters I felt would be able to be reconigsable. there are 6 parameters.

The first is Male or Female. Red faces are Female, Blue are Male.

Next is Long or Short Hair. There should be more polygons in the forehead, the longer the hair. I realise 
this is hard to see when the alpha is faded so I apologise, turn it to opaque at this step.

Next is Face colour. If the face is darker, it is more see-through. Lighter is more opaque.

Then Glasses. I chose this one because when I decided my populace, which I decided on abstract artists, I saw
alot of them had glasses so I decided to make it a feature. There weren't many glasses in the general training population though so this is a bit iffy. If they have glasses, they should have a third eye.

4th is Facial Hair. The nose should be darker if there is facial hair.

5th is  Age. More cheek polygons means the face should be older.

Finally, Curly or Straight Hair? The eyebrow colour should be light if its straight and go darker when it gets
curlier.

Note: My facedata.json file has my new faces and none of the older ones yet the older base photos are still in facemap. i don't know why this is. I'm sorry but I don't know where else they might need to go or if its the system still waiting.
