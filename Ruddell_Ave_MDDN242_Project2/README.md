Semaphore Alphabet, for reference (https://cdn.britannica.com/41/133741-050-FA798221/Semaphore-flag-signals.jpg)

Completed numbers, started interpolation, really liking the way it's animating between the letters A and E.

I have named my font "Fly-High" as the alphabet I used is an alphabet commonly used to communicate long distances and with planes from the ground on the runway.

I also chose words to do with aviation and the Semaphore alphabet, such as Concorde (a really cool looking plane https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/SrdDf9J_kYA5v9xWHdcOFFelq4w=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/b1/93/b1937e31-7b38-4a60-86b3-ab1f95f18a3a/concorde-388-june14.jpg), and FLAGFONT.

I have also added the numbers 1-8 as a 'word' in for my exhibition as I like the way that my numbers look similar to the letters and each other, but I feel like you can still tell which number they are.

Personally I don't feel like any of my animations need tweaking, as the alphabet I have used is very compact and has very straight-forward movements (as it was designed to be used by a person, with flags, on a runway and thus needed to be rather straightforward) and I like the way that the alphabet has been animated.
