## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2



6/5/2020
Each of my letters is composed of 2 squares. My alphabet is based on the Semaphore alphabet, regarding the placement of the squares

Colour-wise I decided to try a simple kind of 'neon' aesthetic

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : the height and width of the squares
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second square relative to the first one

  I began to work on my alphabet, adding some more parameters for the square that is at the bottom in the first few letters. This takes my parameters to a total of 6, 3 controlling each square.

  Parameters for square 1:
  * size1 : the height and width of the first square
  * offsetx1 : the x position of the first square
  * offsety1 : the y position of the first square.

  Parameters for square 2:
  Same as in 6/5/2020 update.
