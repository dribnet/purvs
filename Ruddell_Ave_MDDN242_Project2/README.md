## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2



6/5/2020
Each of my letters is composed of 2 squares. My alphabet is based on the Semaphore alphabet, regarding the placement of the squares

Colour-wise I decided to try a simple kind of 'neon' aesthetic

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : the height and width of the squares
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second square relative to the first one
