## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

 6 parameters per letter

  * size1 : the height and width of the first square
  * offsetx1 : the x position of the first square
  * offsety1 : the y position of the first square

  * size : height and width of second square
  * offsetx : the x position of the second square
  * offsety : the y position of the second square

Semaphore Alphabet, for reference (https://cdn.britannica.com/41/133741-050-FA798221/Semaphore-flag-signals.jpg)

This is my final alphabet. I chose to use the semaphore alphabet to inform my decisions around how my letters looked and the placement of the squares.

Each letter is represented by two squares of different colours, and their position is what indicates which letter. I chose to use two different colours as I felt that it would help the viewer to know which letter was which, as you know that the letter is made up of one pink square and one purple, helping to distinguish a boundary between the letters.

I wanted to steer away from the aviation and naval roots of the semaphore alphabet, and thus decided to use colours that could be considered more modern. I chose colours that fit more into a 'neon' kind of aesthetic (mine taken directly from https://flic.kr/p/2j2strf ) To increase readability I filled the squares with their corresponding colours.

I had some difficulty coming up with a number system that I felt stuck with the essence of the semaphore alphabet without being too similar to the letters. 
I feel like this could have been done better had I been willing to change the sizes of the squares in the number, however I felt that this would have made the numbers not look as though they were part of the overall alphabet.

In the future I would like to go into a project with a more coherent and thought out idea, as although I knew what I wanted to do with this project, had I had a more coherent design idea at the beginning some of the difficulties I encountered (more specifically with the numbers) would have been easier to work through.
