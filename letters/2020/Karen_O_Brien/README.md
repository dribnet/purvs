## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My font is called Game Over and is inspired by the pixelated aesthetic and colour of retro CRT monitors and arcade video games from the late 20th century.

Throughout this project I wanted to be able to create the illusion of movement with my parametric alphabet even though it is still a static image, hence the blue and red colour splitting and slight blur effect of CRT monitors. The shapes of the letters are very pixelated and blocky which also takes reference from this design style. While the shapes this alphabet is composed of are simple squares, effective colour and illusion of movement and having an overall sense of cohesiveness and nostalgia will be the main goal.

For interpolation, I really like how pixelated and glitchy it has come out and I think it works really well with my overall chosen design aesthetic.

Each of my letters consists of 10 square pixels in a 5x5 square grid which can be altered by their x and y co-ordinates.

The twenty parameters per letter:
x1 = Pixel 1/10 x co-ordinate position
y1 = Pixel 1/10 y co-ordinate position

x2 = Pixel 2/10 x co-ordinate position
y2 = Pixel 2/10 y co-ordinate position

x3 = Pixel 3/10 x co-ordinate position
y3 = Pixel 3/10 y co-ordinate position

x4 = Pixel 4/10 x co-ordinate position
y4 = Pixel 1/10 y co-ordinate position

x5 = Pixel 5/10 x co-ordinate position
y5 = Pixel 5/10 y co-ordinate position

x6 = Pixel 6/10 x co-ordinate position
y6 = Pixel 6/10 y co-ordinate position

x7 = Pixel 7/10 x co-ordinate position
y7 = Pixel 7/10 y co-ordinate position

x8 = Pixel 8/10 x co-ordinate position
y8 = Pixel 8/10 y co-ordinate position

x9 = Pixel 9/10 x co-ordinate position
y9 = Pixel 9/10 y co-ordinate position

x10 = Pixel 10/10 x co-ordinate position
y10 = Pixel 10/10 y co-ordinate position
