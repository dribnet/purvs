## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My typeface is called ArcsDeco.
Named so due to the heavy art deco influence and the fact each character is represented by 2 or 3 arcs.


The fourteen parameters per letter:
  >**mainArcSize** size of the main arc
  >**mainArcX** X position of the main arc
  >**mainArcY** Y position of the main arc
  >**mainArcStart** start point of the main arc
  >**mainArcEnd** end point of the main arc
  >**subArcSize1** size of the first sub arc
  >**subArcSize2** size of the second sub arc
  >**subArc1X** X position of the first sub arc
  >**subArc1Y** Y position of the first sub arc
  >**subArc1Start** start point of the first sub arc
  >**subArc1End** end point of the first sub arc
  >**subArc2X** X position of the second sub arc
  >**subArc2Y** Y position of the second sub arc
  >**subArc2Start** start point of the second sub arc
  >**subArc2End** end point of the second sub arc

  Now that the project is over, I am pretty happy with how the alphabet turned out. I stuck to my idea, created a set of rules for each character in my head and stuck to those as well. Each character has the base of dark brown, whether that is the leading shape (leftmost shape), the base of the character (see characters I, S, Y, and 8 for an example of the dark brown being the base), as well as always being a consistant size and shape. The one exception to this is the letter A. I really liked the idea I came up with in my sketch and I wanted to honour it by making it the only uniquely shaped letterform. I could have probably figured out a nice way to make it consistant but I ultimately decided against it. The animations really lend themselves to my design, with few changes needed to be made to make it looking nice. The main issue I had was 'popping'. Simple solution to this was to change the end points at 0 degrees to 360 degrees instead. This way it smoothly transitions between each character.
