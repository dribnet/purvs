## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Neoteric - meaning modern in Latin, this is a clean typeface that is formed by two arcs and two rectangles and gives off a playful and powerful vibe.

From day one I had a general idea of what I was going to do, originally drawing my letters up on paper helped me when it came to the coding side of it. My design has been cohesive throughout this process with a few refinements made. One of the biggest changes I made was changing from a rectangular proportion to a square proportion, this square blocky look made the letters have a better structure that I intended to have. Working with arcs was always scary for me since I found them very confusing however this process helps me a lot to learn the fundamental basics of arcs and I'm not confident in using them. In the beginning, I had more parameters but refine these and restricting myself allowed me to get a better grasp on how to form letters with such limitations now with thirteen parameters my font is still readable and still follows the design I  intended. I decided to make my font in capitals because when it comes to design I prefer using capital letters in my work. Creating these letters was very time consuming but setting up the editor was a massive help for me in producing fast letters.  One thing I struggled with was the numbers since they have complex curves and so much to them, I struggle to fit them in my square proportions whilst making them look good and readable, in the end, I decided to give my numbers rectangular proportions which I'm much happier with. Overall I really did enjoy this assignment and didn't find it too much of a struggle, I'm really happy with how my letters have turned out my favourite letters are D, K, N, Z

The thirteen parameters per letter:
  * `rectX` : x location of the rectangle
  * `rectY` : y location of the rectangle
  * `rectX2` : x location of the second rectangle
  * `rectY2` : y location of the second rectangle
  * `arcSize` : overall size of arcs 
  * `arcX` : x location of the first arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the first arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the first arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the first arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the second arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the second arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the second arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the second arc
