## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Processes:
04/05 I changed colors of letters and background. I also changed some sizes of circles.
06/05 Changed index.html to alphabet.html
12/05 Have some ideas about lettle form and number form. Draw a pen sketch and Update the thumbnail picture. Tomorrow start to do the digital sketch.
Use the thumbnail picture instead of the preview picture.
Try the code. Meet a problem: Want to rotate the arc, but it is failed.
Change arc into triangle. It is easier to code it. Complete "A" sketch.
13/05 Complete the digital sketch.
Change colors, preview image and thumbnail picture.
Start to do Alphabet. Use tutor's ways of code to do Alphabet. Change the thumbnail picture. Tomorrow start to do other letters.
17/05 Complte Alphabet letter D to M.
19/05 Complete Alphabet N to Q.
Complete Alphabet. Change parameters.
Start to do the interaction. Complte A to B, and I will figure out how to do change letters autoly tomorrow. Change the periew picture.
20/05 Change letters and background colors.
Complete exhibition. Make the enhibition show all of letters and numbers. Start to do the editor and figure out why my interaction part only shows A to B.
Do the editor part. Change the name and numbers. But my editor shows nothing.
Nearly complete the whole project.
21/05 Check the whole file to see if it follows the brief. Add purview.json. Replace index.html with exhibition.html.

Final:
My idea comes from the hand letterforms. Audiences can figure out the letters from the look like of my letter fonts. The lines replace the vertical strokes or the leftmost or rightmost part in the letters. Triangles replace spaces in letters and radians in numbers. The orientation of the pointed tip of the triangle is the opening of the number. For example, E, I use a line and two triangles. The line is the vertical line in E. Two triangles means the space between the three horizontal short lines in E. The grey triangle is the top space, and the orange one represents the bottom space. My letters are very playful and lively and they are similar to trees. So I choose green as my main color tone. But the main tone prefers to grey. The grey color will make the letters feel comfortable, harmonious, and reduced the sharpness of the letters. I choose 11 words for my exhibition. These words include all of the letters and numbers. Also, the interaction page shows the wonderful processes of letters.
