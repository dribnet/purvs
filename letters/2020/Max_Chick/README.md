## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

The final design is one I am happy with. It is by no means the most readable font but is the most readable I could under the 3 triangle constraint that I have given myself. The final colour choice is a set of colours that work well together, including a toned down lemon and orange with a minty lime background. The editor was certainly a helpful tool, once I had it sorted, to set paramaters for each letter. A range of words that relate to my font have been selected for this final exhibition version including the font tilte: 'TriiFont'.

The transitions were also imporoved through having more concrete rotation values on the triangles meaning they don't have huge unnecasary movements that some were exhibiting previuosly - doing a full 360 when I was aiming for more smooth comfortable animations.

Stroke and colour were considered with many trials to make a selection that I was satisfied with. The decision in the end to go with no stroke was made to make the letters appear less seperated from the background that they occupied.

As well as colour and stroke selection this final design involves tweaks to almost all letter shapes in attempt to make them as readable as possible. A few of my favourite letter shapes are T, B, M, and W.

Furthering this design could involve experimentation with different shapes other than the original circles, lines, and current triangles.


the final parameters per letter are:
Main triangle
  - rotate1B
  - stroke1Big
first small triangle
  - offset1Smallx
  - offset1Smally
  - rotate1S
  - stroke1Small
second small triangle
  - offset2Smallx
  - offset2Smally
  - rotate2S
