## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Final ReadMe:
I first approached this project with thte idea of using colour theory to show the linear progression of the alphabet. A symbol with contrasting colours (red/blue) would be closer towards either end of the alphabet, but one with less contrasting colours (purple/blue) would be more towards the middle. I then figured that the best colorus to show contrast with would be black and white, so my plan was to have a white box that had mroe balck fill in it, depending on how far along the alphabet the letter was. However, this was really hard to read -you couldn't tell the difference between sequential letters, as the difference was a tiny height change of the black fill. So I looked for other inspiration based of the black/white contrast. The alien symbols in Arrival stood out to me. The symbols, which are the written version of the 'Heptapods' language (https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ucne9lNoYgZNp_k8O57AZPeLElWhbYqzm45TblFDOEXIB9ai24RhtqvtIJQVSjKUN4Kqp4jK7X8eGATgT_UHYzR-S7nxXVh7m7MZ2md9lxnpIQt6RTaV6nVRM1cVCs4OQCLSTlh8fdaXggvEA2D_yfaL), are incredibly stricking and visually unique. I simplified the symbols down, using the circular form, the thick/thin lines, and the black on white contrast, to create my alphabet. My planning for this alphabet is here https://www.flickr.com/photos/187301143@N07/49888399701/in/dateposted-public/ and here https://www.flickr.com/photos/187301143@N07/49887880863/in/dateposted-public/ . 
At first, I was only using the arcs- but they felt too isolated/alone, and the symbols didn't have the thick/thin lineweights that the heptapod symbols do. I made the thick arcs run along part of a thin circle, to create a cohesive circle. The editor was incredibly usefull when changing the arcs- gussing the degrees for all 4 (or 6) start/stop points would've been a massive hassle. I ran through a couple of ideas, from having the circles overlay to create the letter in the middle of the rectangle, to having the circles animate to shift together, but in the end the two circles, on either side of the rectangle, looked the best and reflected the visuals of the movie really well. The alphabet also reflects one of the main messages of the movie- togetherness. In the movie, humans only figure out the aliens purpose when all countries work together, rather than against each other. For my alphabet, it is necessary to bring the two seperate circles together to create the singular letter.
The alphabet is named HEPTFONT, after the 'Arrival' alien species Heptapods. The other words in the exhibition.html are TOGETHER and ISBETTEr - representing the co-operation that is needed in Arrival, and in my alphabet.

One of the main challanges for me this project was the initial ideation period. I had a good theory behind my idea, but it didn't visually translate. Between trying to get that idea to work, and attempting to come up with a new idea, I wasted alot of time. Another challange was getting my head around arcs- they just weren't making sense to me and I couldn't manage to edit them. I finally figured out the having the anglemode in degrees was really important, and that the editor was really usefull. Other than that, it was just a lot of playing around to get the circles and arcs in the right locations/sizes. I enjoyed this project, particularly because I was able to use one of my favourite movies to dictate my creative output.


The thirteen parameters per letter:
  arcStart - start position of the first arc
  arcFinish - end position of the first arc
  arc2Start - start position of the second arc
  arc2Finish - end position of the second arc
  arc3Start - start position of the third arc
  arc3Finish - end position of the third arc
  arc3opacity - visibility of the third arc
  Size1 - diameter of the first circle
  Size2 - diameter of the second circle
  xpos1 - X position of the first circle, also used to position the arcs
  ypos1 - Y position of the first circle, also used to position the arcs
  xpos2 - X position of the second circle, also used to position the arcs
  ypos2 - Y position of the second circle, also used to position the arcs
