## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My font is titled 'CandyPie', a fun, visual font that is dynamic as well as gentle and sweet. 
CandyPie uses two simple shapes, an arc and a triangle. These two elements contrast very well and I had to refine quite a bit to ensure that they worked together nicely.

I wanted a font that was somewhat readable and resembled the English alphabet, but I knew that I wanted it to have a unique charm. Finding a balance between readability and abstraction proved quite difficult, towards the end of my project I used a strokejoin to soften my triangles. 
Using two shapes further reinforced a more abstracted element as I had to think about how to create unique letters and numbers with few elements. I found the letter 'X' especially hard.
Animation is quick and fluid yet still retains a slight sharpness that adds something different to the feel of the design.

I decided to use the scale feature in the beginning as I felt this made it easier for me to work with my shapes. This aspect was purely out of personal preference.

Colour was very important to me and I happened to find one that reflected my design perfectly quite early into the project. I experimented with other colour combinations, such as pink and purple, orange and yellow, and even greens. But no other colours quite captured the aesthetic I was aiming for. These colours pop, they're bold, and they remind me of bubblegum. 

Overall, I quite enjoyed this assignment. Once I had a clear idea of what I wanted, the rest came quite easily. I did find that refining animation was a bit difficult, since with my particular shapes, getting a 100% clean transition was unlikely. The animation I decided on plays into my aesthetic which works very well.



The parameters per letter:
  offsetX - the x offset of the letter components
  offsetY - the y offset of the letter components
  triangleX1 - first x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY1 - first y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX2 - second x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY2 - second y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX3 - third x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY3 - third y co-ordinate of the triangle
  arcSizeX - arc length on the x axis
  arcSizeY - arc length on the y axis
  arcStart - beginning of the arc in degrees
  arcEnd - end of the arc in degrees
