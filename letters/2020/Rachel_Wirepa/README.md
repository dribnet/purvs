## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My font is called Astromec (pronouncd as astro-mech). From the beginning, I was very interested in creating a lower-case alphabet, as I wanted to work with rounded shapes and forms. Originally, I had incorporated a rectangle into my earlier forms; however I decided to replace it with another arc, so that the components of my letters were more cohesive, and I wanted to challenge myself by sticking to only one type of shape for my design. To challenge myself further, I kept all my arcs drawn with a difference of 180 between start and end, and the width and height remained consistently the same. This decision proved to be a little tricky, as I had to adjust many of my letters and numbers several times, before I was happy with the result. For letters such as i, ,l and r, that have a stem, it was difficult trying to use the arcs, especially since I had to position the arcs in several different positions, so that the stem could be seen, and that the form was recognizable to the viewer. Also, letters such as g, j, p, q and y were difficult to design, as all had tails that traditionally dropped below the baseline, and therefore, outside the designated design rectangles. Another challenge was the interpolation animation. Due to the composition and components of my forms, the new letter maps caused my arcs to spin too fast between transitions, making it difficult for the viewer to properly see the transition.

My goal for my alphabet was for it to be visually pleasing and satisfying to look at, especially during the exhibition mode. To ensure this, I chose a colour palette that was inspired from vintage-style space and alien posters (due to my affinity to celestial themes). This was to ensure that my colours were appealing without being overly bold. I also followed this theme with my interpolation animation, as I wanted to utilize the spinning motion of my arcs, and so I altered the new letter maps so that the letter forms would begin a smooth transition, which would then spin into a locking motion, to lock the new form into place, thus resembling the moving and locking motions of the parts of a machine or a fantastical robot. By changing these maps, the motion of my letters contributed to my space/robotics theme and contributed to creating a visual display that was satisfying to look watch. 

The fourteen parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
