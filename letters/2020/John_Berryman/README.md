## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

fist test to see if git working

changed colors and finished sketch using a triangle and three ellipses. pretty simple only uses 11 parameters.

finished alphabet may change main ellipse colour as the contrast bettween the blue and the orange of the background is hard on your
eyes. i used the original backgrond when working on the alphabet ans exiabiton pages.

added a little ellipse just as a design feture, it is the last thing to move in the animation sequence also.
