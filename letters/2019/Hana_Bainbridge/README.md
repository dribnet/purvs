### Final version  

Start of drawing all the squares.
  
The final version is based on the idea of braille cells.In addition, I have used a high color scheme to link in with the theme of braille.
 
The three parameters per letter:
  * `dot1` : The first dot of braille cell.
  * `dot2` : The second dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot3` : The third dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot4` : The fouth dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot5` : The fith dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot6` : The sixit dot of braille cell.
