My initial inspiration came from the change in the shape of the water in the water bottle. The shape of the container is almost constant, and the water inside has different shapes due to gravity and quantity. This is a good example of using  limited elements to create infinite changes. At the same time, the pattern of Tai Chi has a similar meaning. In its circle, lines and points can change infinitely.

So I used 16 parameters. A thin arc and a thick arc form a circular basic structure. Based on it, all letters are based on a circular container, and lines and points are contained inside the container. The sharpness of the lines contrasts with the softness of the arc, and points can be used to connect the two.

My initial sketch used an incomplete circle and used a circular notch as an element in the design system. Later I changed into two arcs with different thicknesses, which used them to reflect the concept of yin and yang changes. The incomplete gap leads to the concept of breakthrough, such as the letter B, the line rushes out of the circular limit, enriching the visual changes. Because the individual of the letter has a strong symbolic meaning and purpose, I have not used these sixteen parameters in every letter. On the whole, I maintain the style of a circular frame, giving the letters a uniform design, while using the method of adding or subtracting elements to highlight the characteristics of the individual.



The 16 parameters per letter:
  * "arcStart1": The beginning of the thick curved line
  * "arcEnd1": End of the thick curved line
  * "arcStart2": The beginning of the thin curved line
  * "arcEnd2": End of the thin curved line
  * "lineX1": First internal line start
  * "lineX2": First internal line end
  * "lineY1": First internal line start
  * "lineY2": First internal line end
  * "lineX3": Second internal line start
  * "lineX4": Second internal line end
  * "lineY3": Second internal line start
  * "lineY4": Second internal line end
  * "point1x": point1
  * "point1y": point1
  * "point2x": point2
  * "point2y": point2
