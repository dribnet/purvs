## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Final

I'm really proud of the final result, my font is interesting and playful a result of bight colouring, and visually engaging forms. While each letter is stand alone, and unique to it's neighbour I'm also happy that it looks consistent and like a collective. The biggest challenge I had was placing my code, into the alphabet.html successfully, and the letters K, Q & R. The widths although altering from letter to letter, are linked together, other than M & W which were challenging due to the width I set. 

Added ? also!
