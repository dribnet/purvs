## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

I wanted to keep it simple and also give it a stylistic treatment.

The letter is made with 6 different vertexes and linked together with lines. I also stuck to the traditional letters shapes to retain the legibility of the words to make things easy for the viewers. Using the vertexes allows for a very smooth "morphing" effect and made the letters as if they are dancing in the air.

I wanted to make the letter look somewhat "sketchy" so I added a loop that duplicates additional lines to the strokes. The animation of the vibrating strokes made it feel like the letters are gaining its energy and cannot wait to "morph" to a different letter. The letters will shake more vigorously as it changes as if it finally unleashed itself to "morph".

I changed the background colour to black to get better contrast.

The parameters are the X and Y positions of the vertexes.

  * `point1x` : X position of the 1st point
  * `point1y` : Y position of the 1st point
  * `point2x` : X position of the 2nd point
  * `point2y` : Y position of the 2nd point
  * `point3x` : X position of the 3rd point
  * `point3y` : Y position of the 3rd point
  * `point4x` : X position of the 4th point
  * `point4y` : Y position of the 4th point
  * `point5x` : X position of the 5th point
  * `point5y` : Y position of the 5th point
  * `point6x` : X position of the 6th point
  * `point6y` : Y position of the 6th point

Thanks to Tom White for the help with the minor modification to the exhibition.html.
