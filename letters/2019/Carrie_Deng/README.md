## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

In the process of designing for project 2, my ultimate goal was to create resumes and letters with high readability and minimize misunderstandings. Initially, my idea was to use five to six lines to construct a very designed but clear letter, which would cause a lot of line changes, resulting in less coherence and naturalness in animation. One obvious solution is to minimize the use of lines. So I chose to use four lines to construct my letters, and I turned capitals into lowercases. While reducing the consumption of lines, select a point from the first and second lines and locate it in the middle of the 100-200 frame respectively. Then pull out two tracks from the middle position, and add two more. A total of four lines constructed my letters. It is not very different from my original idea but also a perfect solution that solved the problem that I faced. I used a total of 12 parameters, two coordinates are defined in the middle of the box, and four additional parameters are added to build two extra lines. 

My letters have two different fonts. One is a square font like C, O, and U. The other is the remaining angular fonts. Also, in the design of letters, I gave K and V a different sense of design and the effect seems very integrated into my other letters which is excellent. The only exception should be my number 8 which is a little bit strange after being angled, but the good thing is that it does not seem very uncomfortable overall. My letters can easily be converted into the next one without jitter. I mean, it changes very smoothly. For the use of color because my letters are minimalist, so I choose the relative simplicity of color to give my theme and my letters a unity.

The twelev parameters for each letter are:

x1 : The x for the first point of line 1

y1 : The y for the first point of line 1

x3 : The x for the first point of line 2

y3 : The y for the first point of line 2

x5 : The x for the first point of line 3

y5 : The y for the first point of line 3

x6 : The x for the second point of line 3

y6 : The y for the second point of line 3

x7 : The x for the first point of line 4

y7 : The y for the first point of line 4

x8 : The x for the second point of line 4

y8 : The y for the second point of line 4
