## Final

This is my final alphabet design.
I named it Hexafont because that's just simply what it is.

I started off from the idea of Las Vegas style light bulb signs,
allowing each segments to simply turn on and off in a frame drawing each letters.

I ended up with the idea of hexagonal grid which is as dense as the square grid, but more flexible when portraying curves. 

I used 4 parameters in total;
   * polygons: Binary signal for 46 hexagons to either color up or not to draw each letters
   * red: R value
   * green: G value
   * blue: B value
