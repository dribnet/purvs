(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

So far I've exhausted my parameters and use all 20. They are the following

The three parameters per letter:
  * "posx" : X position of the rectangles
  * "posy" : Y position of the rectangles
  *	"pos2x" : X position of the smaller triangle
  * "pos2y" : Y position of the smaller triangle
  *	"pos3x" : X position of the larger triangle
  * "pos3y" : Y position of the larger triangle
  * "pos4y" : X position of both arcs
  *	"pos4y" : Y position of both arcs
  * "arcS": Start of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arcE": End of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arc2S" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  * "arc2E" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  *	"recA" : X-coordinate/size of both rectangles
  *	"recB" : Y-coordinate/size of both rectangles
  *	"triX2": first X-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2": first Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2A" : second Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2A" : second X-coordinate of each triangle
  * "triY2B" : third Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2B" : third X-coordinate of each triangle

  I ended up settling on the 1970 colour scheme, but uploaded the other colour scheme anyway for everybodies consideration. The name I settled on for the font is "Aardvark", as a nod to the somewhat peculiar species.
  The Aardvark is associated with a plethora of mythologies and is in many African cultures regarded to be a good luck charm. In a way I wanted my font to express just that: good and positive faith, through simple,
  colourful yet fun design. 
  
  As mentioned before, I wished I would have been able to add texture to my primitives in form of hatching, lines and/or dots. Furthermore, I struggled with the animation process and ended up scrapping it all together
  as it would have otherwise distracted me from the actual alphabet creation process.
  
  Looking back at my process, my plans changed drastically from my initial sketches and I had to accomodate for date by applying many changes to my parameters. I ended up loosing flexibility over several shapes, as
  I exhausted my parameter limit. The way that each shape works, is that a position parameter is attached to each letter, wherefore I´m able to move the shape, after I´ve finalised its coordinates, through the helps
  of the other parameters present. However, I ended up using certain position parameters for multiples shapes, which made it difficult to move the shapes around individually. I thus had particular problems in case
  either both arcs or triangles where present in the same letter, as each were tied to similar coordinates. Often I needed to scrap initial font shapes as a result, and apply new designs to a letter.
  
  Overall I´m happy with my final output and hope to push my output for the third assignment.
