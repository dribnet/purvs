FINAL/EXHIBITION:

Glyphics:

My final alphabet is called glyphics. As stated on previous commits, it was inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphics and had been based on a moon glyph that had been rotated vertically (default). The design has been made to look this way to mimic the look of hieroglyphs as if the letters were carved into a cave. However, instead of using symbols like the Egyptians had done, I wanted to have my letters to still be readable and universal, which is why I stuck to the traditional english letters but mostly focused on the lower case and drawn them out with the elements of the moon glyph (line, arcs and ellipses).

The swap words I've chosen are:
Glyphics = name of font
Egyptian = Word related to concept of letters/font
Glyphica = alternate name for font

Parameters:
line_x1 = x position for starting point of line
line_y1 = y position for starting point of line
line_x2	= x position for end point of line
line_y2	= y position for end point of line
arc1_posx = x position for first arc
arc1_posy = y position for first arc 
arc2_posx = x position for second arc
arc2_posy = y position for second arc
start_a1 = start angle for arc 1
start_a2 = start angle for arc 2
circ1_offset_x = offset x position for circle 1
circ1_offset_y = offset y position for circle 1
circ2_offset_x = offset x position for circle 2
circ2_offset_y = offset y position for circle 2
