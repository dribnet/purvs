Initial Ideal

Each of my letters is composed with rectangles, arcs and lines. The size and position of the first rectangle is fixed, but the location and size of the second rectangle is controlled by three parameters. This my first idea I wanted to use straight lines and a curve, using the rectangle as a base for all the letters but I realised when doing so it was hard to create mojority of the letters by only using those shapes.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second rectangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
