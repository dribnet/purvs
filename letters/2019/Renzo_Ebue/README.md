Each of my letters is composed with three triangles and are made up of 11 parameters. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * size : size of the triangles
  * scale : scale of the triangles
  * offsetx : x offset of the first triangle
  * offsety : y offset of the first triangle
  * offsetx1 : x offset of the second triangle
  * offsety1 : y offset of the second triangle
  * offsetx2 : x offset of the thrid triangle
  * offsety2 : y offset of the thrid triangle
  * rotate : Rotation of the first triangle
  * rotate2 : Rotation of the second triangle
  * rotate3 : Rotation of the third triangle	
 
My initial idea for my alphabet was to be made out of squares and have them look like diamonds, but I struggled to play around with the rect shape, so I instead opted to make them triangles as right angled triangles are basically half squares/rectangles anyway. With my alphabet I wanted to create a 3D effect, so I made my triangles transparent just like how 3D lenses work. 

Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of my work even though I struggled throughout most of it, I may have not produced what my initial idea was but I improvised and created something that I am happy with. The 3D effect didn't really turn out the way I expected to turn out, but it's the though that matters.
