## Penta Point Polys (PentaPtPoly.ttf)

My each letter in my font is an irregular open polygon in the shape of that letter, consisting of five vertex points each.
The majority of my letters are non-uniform and they all reach the boundaries of the 100x200px canvas.

My favourite letter in my font was 'K' as it was one that I struggled with initially but was able to solve in a unique and visually appealing way.
My least favourite is the '?' as I didn't manage to find a way to make it work within the five vertex points.

I managed to achieve less than 12 parameters
The ten parameters per letter:
  * `x1` : X-Position of Point 1
  * `y1` : Y-Position of Point 1
  * `x2` : X-Position of Point 2
  * `y2` : Y-Position of Point 2
  * `x3` : X-Position of Point 3
  * `y3` : Y-Position of Point 3
  * `x4` : X-Position of Point 4
  * `y4` : Y-Position of Point 4
  * `x5` : X-Position of Point 5
  * `y5` : Y-Position of Point 5
