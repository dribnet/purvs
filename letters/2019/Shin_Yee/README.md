Final Interaction 

This is my final design of my alphabets. The final interaction showed the animation of the alphabets.

The parameters per letter:
  * `size` : length of the rectangle
  * `t1x` : x axis of the first corner of the first triangle
  * `t1y` : y axis of the first corner of the first triangle
  * `t2x` : x axis of the second corner of the first triangle
  * `t2y` : y axis of the second corner of the first triangle
  * `t3x` : x axis of the third corner of the first triangle
  * `t3y` : y axis of the third corner of the first triangle
  * `t4x` : x axis of the first corner of the second triangle
  * `t4y` : y axis of the first corner of the second triangle
  * `t5x` : x axis of the second corner of the second triangle
  * `t5y` : y axis of the second corner of the second triangle
  * `t6x` : x axis of the third corner of the second triangle
  * `t6y` : y axis of the third corner of the second triangle
  * `e1x` : x axis of the first circle
  * `e1y` : y axis of the first circle
  * `e2x` : x axis of the second circle
  * `e2y` : y axis of the second circle
  * `e3x` : x axis of the third circle
  * `e3y` : y axis of the third circle
  * `e4x` : x axis of the fourth circle
  * `e4y` : y axis of the fourth circle
  * `r1x` : x axis of the first rectangle
  * `r1y` : y axis of the first rectangle
  * `r2x` : x axis of the second rectangle
  * `r2y` : y axis of the second rectangle
