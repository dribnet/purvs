PAPER CUTTING
For my alphabet, the original idea is the chinese paper cutting art. Paper cutting is a fun job, you can use the paper and scissors to cut a paper to many wonderful shapes. For my alphabet, I use two arcs to cut the rectangle to create letters to perform the paper cutting art

For the color use, I choose red letters and pink background. The reason for me to use this color is that, in China, most paper cutting use red paper. Red is the color repersent lucky and happniess in chinese culture background. 

For the animation, I made the arc to spin in a really fast speed, to give the exhibition a really interesting effect, which looks like the spinning arc is cutting the paper which can refect my idea. 

The parameter I used in my code.
size     -the x wide of first arc
sizee11  -the y wide of first circle
offsetx  -the x position of first arc
offsety  -the y position of first arc

sizee21  -the x wide of sec arc
sizee22  -the y wide of sec arc
offsetx1 -the x position of sec arc
offsety1 -the y position of sec arc

arc11    -the begin of first arc
arc12    -the end of first arc
arc21    -the begin of sec arc
arc22    -the end of sec arc
