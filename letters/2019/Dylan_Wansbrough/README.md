My idea is based off of Signs from The Witcher series. Each of the signs are a triangle shape. So Im trying to make my letters look like some sort of triangle moprh.

I have created a set of magical runes. I gave them a blue glow underneath (couldnt use blur as it would blur each letter stacking) to make it stand out more and make it look more magaical. As for he transistion I made it so that at each 25% the next letter starts, this makes it look like its building each part of the letter and makes it have a more runic look than a smooth transition.
