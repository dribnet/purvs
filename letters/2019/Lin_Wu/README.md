This is the final of my alphabet

In this part I add a shadow for my background circle make it look more prominent.
Do some change of my letter “L” “3” “4” “7” “8”, the shadow make that letter looks terrible.

The name of this font I call it “linsfont” I base of my name “lin”,
The main design concept of my alphabet is “The Mars” Because the color of my alphabet I use are muddy yellow and orange, the background pattern is a circle. I make me associate Mars. So the two words I pick are “THE MARS” “SAPPHIRE" and "ASTEROID”. The unique point of my font is some of the letters look abstract because I did not use they coordinate parameter to design my font.

Current progress. Making the alphabet.

In this part I set up and use the editor to design my font.
At first I want to use 25 parameter for my editor, but I find the maximum parameter of editor is 16 parameter.
On my first design I got 7 rectangle to help me design my font, but now I have to delete two of them, and I can not put x, y coordinate parameter and size parameter of my 5 rectangle because it more then
16 and I make my code looks messy, so I gave up the y parameter of my rectangle. I use “x” coordinate parameter, the width and height parameter to make my font

The 15 parameters per letter:
"r1x" - x coordinate of first rectangle
"r1y" – width of first rectangle
"r1l" – height of first rectangle
"r2x" - x coordinate of second rectangle
"r2y" – width of second rectangle
"r2l" – height of second rectangle
"r3x" - x coordinate of third rectangle
"r3y" – width of third rectangle
"r3l" – height of third rectangle
"r4x" - x coordinate of fourth rectangle
"r4y" – width of fourth rectangle
"r4l" – height of fourth rectangle
"r5x" - x coordinate of fifth rectangle
"r5y" – width of fifth rectangle
"r5l" – height of fifth rectangle

My initial idea was to use slice circle (like a burger) to design my font. But when I try to do it, I find I can not use p5. Js to achieve my idea, so I change my design.
In this sketch, I use a radius 40px circle for my background and I draw some rectangle on it, it can make it looks like cut the circle as a slice. I can change the position and the size of my rectangle to draw the font.

coding: posx, posy,pos2x,pos2y control the position of the shapes.

color use: bright background and dark letters
