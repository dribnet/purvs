Development

Overall design process:

Throughout my design process I had intended on keeping the rules of having each letter compromise of lines using a circle to create their form. Also for the lines to be a different thickness from the circle. 

While developing my alphabet I was inspired by the idea of sunlight. I was inspired when I started playing around with colour and ended up choosing a warm colour palette. I had expanded on this idea beyond colour by adding in blue specks to create the impersonation of dust in the sunlight and had lines running through the alphabet like light streaks.

One of my problems I had while developing my alphabet was keeping to the parameter limit. I had this problem because of the multiple coordinates for my lines. If I was to do this project again I should make the aligning co-ordinates new “let” variables instead of another parameter. 
A problem I overcome was to make each individual letter flow better as a whole in exhibition. I wanted my letters to still be contained with their green boxes at the same time as well. I solved this problem by making horizontal lines on the already vertical lines in the background and made them flow both left and right, so that whatever side a letter is on it flows on from the one before or after it. I also added as ellipse between each letter to acknowledge the gap and make it visually smaller.

Overall I am happy with my alphabet, I like the warm yet bubbly mood it gives off and I think the letters have a successful continuous style throughout.

  * 'ly2_1': y co-ordinate of line2
  * 'c1x': x position of main ellipse
  * 'c1y': y position of main ellipse
  * 'lx': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'ly': y co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lx2': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lx3': x co-ordinate of line3
