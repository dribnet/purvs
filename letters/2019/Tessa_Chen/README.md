## Freeflow

The idea for my font came from morse code. I chose this as my base because I really liked the idea of how we came to create a system of dots and dashes, and the secretive and mysterious vibe to it. I followed this system and used the dots and dashes of each alphabet to construct them into my own set of fonts, trying to place them in a way that is as close to the way each letter looks like and find a cleaer way to communicate to the audience on what a set of dots and dashes stands for.  

For the numbers, I found the original morse code's system was already pretty clear so I followed the original, except for the '0' which consisted of four dashes, which was convenient because I could set them into places that symbolized a digital '0'.

After finishing up my interaction, I was pretty satisfied with the animation and I found that it flowed really smoothly, sort of like liquid. This gave me the inspiration to add an extra animation to the exhibition, and the letteres will have a constant fluid movement as they form into words. This also gave me the idea of uing a blue background to show it's watery flow, and a nice contrast to the orange font. 


20 parameters per letter, 4 for each ellipse of one alphabet:

  * `ballposx`: x position of first ellipse
  * `ballposy`: y position of first ellipse
  * `ballsizew`: width of first ellipse
  * `ballsizeh`: height of first ellipse
  * `ball2posx`: x position of second ellipse
  * `ball2posy`: y position of second ellipse
  * `ball2sizew`: width of second ellipse
  * `ball2sizeh`: height of second ellipse
  * `ball3posx`: x position of third ellipse
  * `ball3posy`: y position of third ellipse
  * `ball3sizew`: width of third ellipse
  * `ball3sizeh`: height of third ellipse
  * `ball4posx`: x position of fourth ellipse
  * `ball4posy`: y position of fourth ellipse
  * `ball4sizew`: width of fourth ellipse
  * `ball4sizeh`: height of fourth ellipse
  * `ball5posx`: x position of fifth ellipse
  * `ball5posy`: y position of fifth ellipse 
  * `ball5sizew`: width of fifth ellipse
  * `ball5sizeh`: height of fifth ellipse
