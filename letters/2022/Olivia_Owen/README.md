TYPEFACE: PINPOINT

Growing up, my favourite toy was an interactive, moulding pin board, which inspired me. These boards are largely composed of small plastic pin-like components. When you put something behind the pin board, the pins slide forward to the front of the board, revealing a sculpture of what you put behind it.

When considering typefaces, I opted to base my type on something physical, and I challenged myself to code this. I began by experimenting with eclipses. This is where I began to realise that a shadow-like appearance would be required to communicate that the pins were moving forward/being pushed.I toyed around with offsetting many eclipses and how the actual board would be displayed. Whether it was from the side, diagonally, or from the front. I chose a diagonal perspective so that the typography remained legible while the concept was comprehended.

I also studied the possibility of making the text look more like a dominoe, and iterated on that idea, but I felt that the pin board was an interesting concept that I should pursue. I played up on the kid-friendly notion by using wacky purple colours and chose one colour to bring the entire presentation together - especially for the exhibition.
The number of factors was a concept that I found very restricting in terms of my idea. It made it exceedingly difficult for me to produce a beautiful interpolation transition, limiting my overall vision. If I were to perform this project again, I would limit my circle x and y parameters to one set X and Y for each grid sector (make only 9 sectors). This would allow me to work with the eclipse size to create the illusion that my pins were moving forwards to form the letters during transition.
