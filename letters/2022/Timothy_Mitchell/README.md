Final

My final design is called Foxberrry. Each character is comprised of a base rectangle as well as four cut out shapes on top that use the same colour as the background. The shapes used for the cutouts are two rectangles and two triangles. originally I planned on using four quads for a more accurate font type but after attempting this in my sketch I realised it was not possible as it used far too many parameters. 

Although my letters would have looked much better if I were able to have used quads I think the way I used my cut outs achieved a very clean and consistent look. I Like the way some letters look normal and some look super funky, there is a nice balance between the two.  

I ended up working with the following 20 parameters.

- x coordinate of rect 1
- y coordinate of rect 1
- width of rect 1
- height of rect 1

- x coordinate of rect 2
- y coordinate of rect 2
- width of rect 2
- height of rect 2

- x coordinate of point 1 triangle 1
- y coordinate of point 1 triangle 1
- x coordinate of point 2 triangle 1
- y coordinate of point 2 triangle 1
- x coordinate of point 3 triangle 1
- y coordinate of point 3 triangle 1

- x coordinate of point 1 triangle 2
- y coordinate of point 1 triangle 2
- x coordinate of point 2 triangle 2
- y coordinate of point 2 triangle 2
- x coordinate of point 3 triangle 2
- y coordinate of point 3 triangle 2

Un fortunately i was unable to achieve the type of animation I wanted at the beginning. At first i wanted the letters to blink into each other. I realised this was impossible when i started coding the interpolations. sadly i already had 20 parameters and the base shape wasn't one of them so I couldn't animate it at all. this left me with just the cutouts to work with so I managed to make them move around the base into their various positions. This looks rather clean now that is it cleaned up.

I am happy with the alphabet I have come up with. I think it is an incredibly readable and consistent alphabet with smooth animations.
