## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2
I have now finished and the most noticeable change I have had was my transition between letters. I eventually decided to set it all to the same value between 20-80 as this sped up the initial transition. This may seem like a cop out which is slightly was due to intense difficulties making all the transitions smooth but the decision was also made in a theory similar to the start where I changed my letters from refined to rough. The jagged rough transitions lend to help showcase the font for what it is, which is a sharp , jagged in your face type of font where you never really know what is happening but your brain can still process the words spelt. Similar to the theory where a human brain can read a whole paragraph of words even if they re spelt wrong but if the start and end letters are correct and the length is accurate then the brain makes up the rest.

If I were to do this code again I would not commit to the triangle technique I used as it took days to finish all the letters due to me not being able to copy and paste the values the editor gave me due to me not being on a mac. I tried 3 different browsers but none worked.
