## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2



I have changed the numbers of the alphabet so instead of representing the actual numbers they have become more abstract. I've made it so that there represented by the two arcs. The bottom one starts 1/5 filled in and gradualy increases by a 5th untill it's full. Once the bottom arc is full the top arc rotates by 1/5th every number. I think this change was good as it was very to make the numbers distigusable from some of the letters and some of the numbers were hard to make. although I miss the 2 I think that these numbers look much cleaner and follows obvious rules which fits into the asthetic of my alphabet. 

I've also been playing around with the interpolation alot and have to constantly delete my progress. This is because as soon as one problem is solved another pops up because of it. Going between the e and the j is a lot smoother now.
