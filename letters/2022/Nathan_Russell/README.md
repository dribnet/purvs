Here is the halftone effect, more or less to my liking. No matter how much I adjusted it I could never the balance between readability and prettiness so here is my best attempt. Evidently, I reverted to the glitch effect in the final iteration but this is basically what I had envisioned in my head.
=======
First of all and most importantly, I removed the ugly colours. I also made it so that the script loaded the intended variables, which only took so long because I loaded them through arrays rather than typing out all 20 identical parameters with slightly different names. But it's working now, and to test I wrote some testing script to draw a circle where each parameter controlled because the halftone script still isn't running as intended yet. But I actually really like the look of the big blobs and am considering implementing them into the final versino some how. Lastly, I coded the parameters for each letter in the alphabet. It immediately looked very pixelated so I decided that I might aswell make use of the fact the fact that chunks are placed based on integers and not just binary 1's or 0's, so I took a very natural approach to changing the parameters. This gave them a natural blobby look. This blobby look isn't the most readable, and I will be fixing some of the letters soon, but overall I'm happy with its very human form. It kind of reminds me of petri dish growth.
