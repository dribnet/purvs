# MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

##I have finished my final design!

I'm really happy with what I finished with, and I really enjoyed working on this project. I enjoyed doing trying to figure out how to use my custom shape, because I was struggling with it so much, I was really happy when I finally got it to work. It went through a lot of changes, and it eventually ended up just being the arc, which I like a lot better to the half shape that it was. I chose to do a child-like kind of font, with some cute pastel shades. I chose this because with my custom shape, it was quite restricting on what shapes I could make with it. To make it legible, it had to be quite curvy and silly looking. I chose to lean into this more, and embrace the little curves and make it intentional.

The parameters I had:

*sizeX* - Manages the horizontal size of the ellipse
*sizeY*  - Manages the vertical size of the ellipse
*offsetx* - The X position of the ellipse
*offsety*  - The Y position of the ellipse
*curveMidX* - Manages the X depth of the curve
*curveMidY* - Manages the Y depth of the curve
*curveX* - Manages the slope of the custom shape
*curveY* -  Manages the length of the custom shape
*translateX* -  The X position of the custom shape
*translateY* - The Y position of the custom shape
*2curveMidX* -Manages the X depth of the second curve
*2curveMidY* - Manages the Y depth of the second curve
*2curveX* - Manages the slope of the second curve
*2curveY* - Manages the length of the second shape
*2translateX* -  Manages the X position of the second shape
*2translateY* - Manages the Y position of the second shape


One part I was having difficulty with was making the actual letters. It wasn't hard at all, I just seemed to not be able to focus and sit down and do the letters, which made my life a lot more difficult. I was struggling with making the parameters at first, and I had no idea how I would use a custom shape, but eventually it just clicked.

I want to say that my original idea differs greatly from what I ended up with. I wanted to do a paint stroke type of thing, and make it very abstract. I did follow my original colour scheme though, since I was going to do paint strokes, I was going to have a bunch of bright happy colours, and even though I went with more pastel colours, they're still very happy and bright.

If I was to do this project again, I think I would try to do a more complex custom shape. It would be a lot more trouble, but I think it would have been cool to have a shape that was really sharp in places, and it was just one big bendy line. I would have also liked to have made a better theme, as the one I have at the moment feels a bit simple.
