## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

  In this project, we are required to make 37 alphabet letters, including A-Z and 0-9, and a default alphabet.

  My initial goal was to make readable alphabets. To begin, I sketch my first impression of alphabets in Photoshop, imagining how they would appear as parameter elements, which I can easily copy and paste and move around to create my design concept. Based on this first impression, I pushed forward and redesigned it several times until I arrived at concept 1.

  Once I've gotten into the code for the concept1, I'm starting to notice the imperfections. The variables in the parameters were the most difficult thing I had to deal with. I'm not sure how to set up a few of the parameters. As a result, there is a problem in which a key shape exists that would make the alphabet more readable, but it is unable to do so. As a result, my entire design appears to be very different from the first concept I drew on paper. All of my alphabet will have to be redesigned. Despite the fact that this is a major issue, I decided to concentrate on what I can do right now, so I changed the color palette of my alphabet.

  I drew up new ideas for concept 2 and immediately implemented them in the code. It now appears to be a lot better and is getting closer to my final design. The characters kept some of the elements of the original simple alphabets, even though they were no longer as readable. I changed the colors again because I didn't like them the first time.

  In the final, there isn't much room for improvement. The feedback I received was generally positive except for the colors, so I changed the color palette once more.
