## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Final:
Letters:
My alphabet is designed to be in lowercase. My main goal for the letters was to have all three of the main elements present in each letter design/on the page. In some instances the elements (mainly the lines) didn't contribute to the overall design - to make sure they didn't take away from the main design, I tried to place them either above or inside the letter. Each element also had rules. For the arc I worked with 45 degree segments and for the lines I worked in sizes of 25.

There are 8 parameters I'm working with:
* arcStartAngle : this is the 'start' angle that the arc will start at.
* arcStopAngle : this is the 'stop' angle that the arc will stop at.

* Line1_X_startcoord : x coordinate of the starting line point.
* Line1_X_stopcoord : x coordinate of the stopping line point.
* horizontalLineY : y position of the whole line.

* verticalLineX : x position of the whole line.
* Line2_Y_startcoord : y coordinate of the starting line point.
* Line2_Y_stopcoord : y coordinate of the stopping line point.

Numbers:
I wanted to make the numbers distinctive from the letters. As I mentioned before, the letters are made to be lowercase so for the numbers I tried to designed them to be a bit bigger and essentially uppercase.

Interpolations:
For the interpolation I used an if statement to then create an in between state for each animation - basically the arc completes a full 360 and both the horizontal and vertical lines pull into the centre and shrink down before everything transitions into the next letter. I played around with faster timing a little bit by changing the percentages (up to 75%), but decided to stick with 50 because it changed to the new letter to quickly at the end that you don't really get to see the full animation.

Final Thoughts:
I'm happy with my final alphabet design. I really like the simplistic look of it and while its not the most readable, I think for the most part you can make out what each word says. I also enjoyed the challenge of trying to have all the elements on the page consistently. Overall an enjoyable project to work on. :)
