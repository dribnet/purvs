### 05/05/22 Final

The name of this font is negative. I created this font by putting negative space on rectangle. This font is created by 2 rectangles and 1 triangle.

I used 10 parameters.
rectPositionX: x offset of the rectangle
rectPositionY: y offset of the rectangle
rectwidth: width of the rectangle
rectheight: height of the rectangle

triPosition1X: x offset of edge 1 of triangle
triPosition1Y: y offset of edge 1 of triangle
triPosition2X: x offset of edge 2 of triangle
triPosition2Y: y offset of edge 2 of triangle
triPosition3X: x offset of edge 3 of triangle
triPosition3Y: y offset of edge 3 of triangle

I got inspiration from the IQ test that you have to guess what in the black and white picture.

I wanted the colour of background and letters the same to make it clear that the theme for this font, negative space. However, with 2 simple shapes it needs outline to make the letters readable, but outline also makes it ugly. So I decided not to use same colour, since it can still show the negative space.

While coding the font, I felt like I'm playing with building blocks because I was keep changing the position of the shapes to create letters. So I rounded corners of shapes to make them more like toy. Unintentionally, it created curvy edges on some letter such as I.

Originally, I was planning to use black and white for this project, but black represents empty or void. Letters need to have volume otherwise it will be negative space and empty. But I wanted the colour contrast for negative space, so I decided to use dark blue.
