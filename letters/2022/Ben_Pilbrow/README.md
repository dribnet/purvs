README - FINAL THOUGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall I am really pleased with my letter forms for this project. I set out to follow strict design goals while still making a readable and nice looking "designed" letter form and I believe I succeed in this aspect.

The design goal and limits I set for myself slightly changed as my idea developed, and you can see my thought process behind these decisions through the many versions online. The goal I set for myself ended up being to limit myself to use a maximum of three parameterized rectangles within a squared rectangle frame. I am pleased I set myself a goal because it not only was a fun challenge, but it also helped to make sure all the letter forms fit together cohesively and made the final product a more unique design. It did make creating some of the letters much harder, in particular the letter "K" I struggled with, however in the end I think all the letter tie together well and work as a whole. One thing I think works well about this design goal is that most of the people who have seen the finished product don't actually realize that I was limiting myself with the three rectangles. This says to me that the limitation doesn't take away from the design, and in fact I think it adds to it.

One issue I ran into over the course of development was using too many parameters. My final total is exactly 20, the upper limit for how many we could use. Because of the number of controls I needed for each of the three rectangles the total number quickly multiplied. I ended up having to remove the parameters that controlled the corner rounding on the first rectangle, which did make it harder to create some of the letter forms I had initially sketched out. However this constraint also provided a fun challenge, figuring out where I could get away with using a squared off rectangle and where I NEEDED to use the rounded corners.

The colour scheme didn't change at all over the course of development, and this is in part due to the fact I actually spent a fair amount of time in the beginning when creating the initial sketch picking a nice colour palate. In the past I have been unhappy with the colours I tend to pick out for my projects, so this time I wanted to get that sorted at the beginning.

An area of my project that could have used some more work is the animation between each letter. Due to being busy with work outside of uni, I had to miss one session of class, the one that focused on the letter interpolation. This wasn't a massive deal as I could catch up a few days later and had then implemented the basics, however I missed a lot about how to add a bit of a creative flare to the animations. In this final stage the animations work fine and look fine, however it feels like they could use a little something to spice them up. Next time I would allocate some more time towards catching up on this area and making an animation that looked extra flash, just to add a bit of polish to the whole project.

As I said at the start, I am overall really happy with my results on this project. I kept to a simple, but strict and at times challenging design goal and ended up creating what I believe to be a nice looking set of letter forms. I am particularly happy with the numbers, 5 especially I think works well, especially considering the limitations I set myself. It was great fun working on this project and a interesting puzzle to figure out how to actually draw some of the more complex letters with this design limitation. Looking forward to project 3!
