## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Exhibition

This is my final. the letter was originally inspired by a bow and arrow, so I called it ARROWS. the letter consists of two arcs, two lines and a triangle. A straight line and a triangle are fixed to form the arrow, which is the characteristic of this font.

The biggest problem I encountered in this project was the interaction page. Since there is a lot of rotation, DEGREE does not work here, so the transition has a big problem in the interaction page. But it looks fine on the exclusion page.
