## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

### Future Block (FUTURBLK)
Overview:
The concept for my font was to create a simple yet trendy font. As a communication design student, I have fallen in love with typography and now I always want to see the new trends in type. One very interesting form of type coming into emergence is tape typography. 

Precendents for this project were Neue Machina Medium by Panagram Panagram Fonts and Gap Sans Bold by Open Foundry. In this assignment I plan to merge to the two styles as well as add in my own flare.

I used these as inspiration but with a catch. For my type I will only use 4 rectangles to make up the letterform. With this restriction I also made it that I was only allowed to rotate, position and play with the height of each rectangle. There was no repositioning points on the rectangles and no adjusting the width of the rectangle. This kept the idea that I was playing around with tape.

Through these limitations I did encounter some speed bumps. Such as creating the 'B'. Since I only had 4 rectangles, I couldn't make a capital 'B' with what I had. I would need 5 rectangles to achieve a capital 'B'. I settled for a lowercase 'b' and to be honest I think it fits nicely with the overall theme.

One thing I like about this font is that it looks like it has been done by hand. With some imperfections, weird angles and lowercase letters, it gives it a street style/rough look to it - which I like. The limitations that I brought to this project did help with this look where I would play around a lot with rotations to make the letterform look like the english letter in the alphabet. 

Overall I am pretty happy with how it turned out :)

This font uses 5 squares.
 - 4 squares make up the font
 - 1 square is the border/container of the font

The sixteen parameters per letter:
  * `Rect1x` : x-position of the first rectangle
  * `Rect1y` : y-position of the first rectangle
  * `Rect1h` : height of the first rectangle
  * `Rect1r` : rotation of the first rectangle

  * `Rect2x` : x-position of the second rectangle
  * `Rect2y` : y-position of the second rectangle
  * `Rect2h` : height of the second rectangle
  * `Rect2r` : rotation of the second rectangle

  * `Rect3x` : x-position of the third rectangle
  * `Rect3y` : y-position of the third rectangle
  * `Rect3h` : height of the third rectangle
  * `Rect3r` : rotation of the third rectangle

  * `Rect4x` : x-position of the fourth rectangle
  * `Rect4y` : y-position of the fourth rectangle
  * `Rect4h` : height of the fourth rectangle
  * `Rect4r` : rotation of the fourth rectangle
