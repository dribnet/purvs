## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Done polishing now, I touched up the letter 'p' and 'q' since they won't show properly in the interaction part. Also fixed the number '3' for I didn't like the look for a while. Overall I enjoyed this project a lot. It was fun to do, it
did take me a while to think of what to do with my alphabet for a while. So when I did think of one it hasn't really changed much throughout the project. The interaction part was the most fun to do, if I had more time I would of liked to spend more in that part and also
change some letters such as 's' it's my least favourite out of the alphabet I had made, along with the number '8'.
I also feel like I could have exploded more if I wasn't unwell due to covid for a while such as the colors more but I do like what I got so far. Decided to name the alphabet DotnLine, since that is what its main objects are made out of.
