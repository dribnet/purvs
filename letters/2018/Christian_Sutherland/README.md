For my font, I chose to make it be lowercase, because that is simpler than capital letters.
I also wanted to make use of the "blue & orange" color palette.

I decided to use ellipses to form my font, because they don't rotate, and so the only parameters necessary were their 'x & y' positions.
However, just three ellipses was not enough geometry to form letter shapes, so I added the use of a rectangle.

Though some letters & numbers are abstract in appearance, I generally applied a rule of making sure the letters and numbers were recognizable by common standards.




I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
