Gefallen/Befallen

For my font I have based my idea around the old germaic/gothic font styles. For the shapes to make up my font I have taken inspiration from the deathly hallows from Harry Potter. The shapes are an arc, a line and a triangle. they are also the shapes/parts of the deathly hallows in Harry potter. I have changed the colours to a dark red background and the text being a dark bold black. I chose this because it helps give my font a darker and older feel. 

To get my shapes I have used 12 paramaters. Two for the arc which are the degree locations of each point. Six are for the triangle with the x and y co-ordinate of each point. I also have four paramaters for the location of the line with the x and y position of each point. For my interacton movement I have change it slightly to snap into the last position for more of an impact when it becomes the letter. Experimenting more I would make the arc transition more fluid and consistent between all letters.



I have twelve paramaters for each of my letters;
    "a1" : The first angle of the arc.
  	"a2" : The second Angle of the arc.

  	"tx1" : The first X location of the triangle.
  	"ty1" : The first Y location of the triangle.
  	"tx2" : The second X location of the triangle.
  	"ty2" : The second Y location of the triangle.
  	"tx3" : The third X location of the triangle.
  	"ty3" : The third Y location of the triangle.

  	"lx1" : The first X location of the line.
  	"ly1" : The first Y location of the line.
  	"lx2" : The second X location of the line.
  	"ly2" : The second Y location of the line.
