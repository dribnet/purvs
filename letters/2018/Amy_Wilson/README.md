For my final design I decided to take out the colour transition for the interpolation as it created a weird effect for the final exhibition. Instead, I just made the ring colour a brighter turquoise. I also decided to make the lines a bit thicker since theyw ere going to be a lighter colour, and I also tried to pick a grey that had a turquoise tinge to it so that the three elements could clearly be identified as creating one overall shape (letter). I wanted the overall look of the letters to be abstract, with the focus of each letter being on the blue ring. I tried to make my letters abstract enough that they didn't look like a standard letter but still readable enough that you can actually decipher it. To created a unified look, I made all of the letters the same height with at least 1 line and they all have an arc with the same circle coordinates. I didn't want all of my letters to have two lines so when my length parameter is at 0, the line is not drawn.


The final parameters are:
	* arc Start: The angle in degrees of where the arc starts
	* arc End: The angle in degrees of where the arc ends
	* arc X: The x pos of the centre of the circle that the arc is created from
	* arc Y: The y pos of the centre of the circle that the arc is created from
	* length1(2): The length of the line
	* tilt1(2): The angle in degrees of the line
	* position X1(2): The x pos of the first coordinate of the line
	* position Y1(2): The y pos of the first coordinate of the line
