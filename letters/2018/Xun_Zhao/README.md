Sleek font

At the beginning, I just wanted to design the fonts that can be made up of two circles and two lines. But I had no idea at all, I did not know how to combine these shapes to generate the fonts, and we also are asked  to use less than 12 parameters to make these letters in a distorted with each other. 

Therefore, I made some research. Firstly, I just search all of movies that I saw and browsed some websites to inspire me. Finally I found a movie that name is Tron: Legacy, especially the movie's propaganda poster and the figures which are on these person's clothes. These things were giving me a lot of inspiration. 

However, I still thought that was not enough to support my design. I almost can be according to the movie to complete my design, but I wanted these fonts to be seen as letters, but my first idea cannot support it, like Z and N, I did not know how to combine circles and lines to make them. If I persist use circles and lines, these 12 parameters are not enough to make these letter in a distorted with each other. So I change my idea and used arcs instead of the circles. So I would be thinking how to let the arcs and lines to generate the letters. 

One day, when I use my iPhone, I was inspired by the id touch. I suddeenly thought of the screen when iPhone entered fingerprint. The fingerprinting screen reminded me of how my graphics can be rotated, retracted and changed the position to complete these letters. 

Therefore, These are my progress of my idea and design.

There are 12 parameters on my alphabet.

posx and posy are controlling the position of every letters.

Parameters:
x co-ordinate of the start of first arc
y co-ordinate of the end of first arc
x1 x_co-ordinate of the start of first arc
y1 y_co-ordinate of the end of first arc

line1
x2 x_co-ordinate of first point of line segment
y2 y_co-ordinate of first point of line segment
x3 x_co-ordinate of second point of line segment
y3 y_co-ordinate of second point of line segment

line2
x4 x_co-ordinate of first point of line segment
y4 y_co-ordinate of first point of line segment
x5 x_co-ordinate of second point of line segment
y5 y_co-ordinate of second point of line segment
