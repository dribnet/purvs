  I basically used quadrilateral shapes (by vertex) and rect to build up my font. Opacity and stroke in my font is used to visualize new shapes and color between quad and rect. The quadrilateral shapes I created are pretty random however the only rule in my deisign (similarities of each alphabet) is  that there's always a vertex sticking with position 0 on X axis. The font design is pretty solid ,simple and has a little sense of ancient egyptian style. 


Intercations 
I used applymatrix() in the interpolate function to apply vibration affect to my fonts 

Design Concepts
The design was inpired by a geometric typeface from pinterest. Im using a quadrilateral shape as the main body and a rect as a sub body to form my letter. The quadrilateral shape should hold more spaces than the rect shape in each letter. The reason I have chosen the quadrilateral shapes is because it allows me to make more changes to the form of my letter and using rect as a sub component to bring out the style of my design and the connection of each of my letter since my quadrilateral shapes are pretty random.

Challenges 
I tried to make the quadrilateral shape taking as much spaces as it can because I want to make it as solid as it can. The only thing im not happy with is the letter W, M, and X. It is  pretty obvious that they are quiet different compared to my other letters. I made the quadrilateral shape into 2 triangles and thats kind of running away from my original idea. However I have tried everything I can at this point and this is the best outcome I have got. There's always a way to code out intersting stuff by using simple funtion and that is what I'm enjoying about coding so far.  
 

12 parameters


x1 : 1st vertex of x positiom
y1 : 1st vertex of y positiom  
x2 : 2nd vertex of x positiom
y2 : 2nd vertex of y positiom  
x3 : 3rd vertex of x positiom
y3 : 3rd vertex of y positiom  
x4 : 4th vertex of x positiom
y4 : 4th vertex of y positiom  
size1 : size x of rect 
size2 : size y of rect 
pos2x : position x of rect
pos2y : position y of rect
