## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Final
   
For this project, my letter forms I wanted to be arcs. My initial idea was to make three to four arcs depending on how many I need for my alphabet, however I quickly realised that made it too messy and I wanted something simple and elegant. After making the first three letter to test it out I decided that it would be better to change my idea.

This next idea I wanted the arcs to be more like full circles but not quite. I change it to two arcs one bigger and one smaller as I like the look of it more. With this it was more interesting to see what forms I could come with just two arcs. I sketch out all my letter forms so it was easier to make which was really helpful. 

Some problems I had with these arcs was that the arcs would not show up or it would show up but not change when I increased or decreased the arc. These problems were easy fixes as it was just simply naming variables wrong or misplacing things. Another major problem I ran into that took me a while to figure out was how to rotate the arcs in the letter.js and not draw. Eventually I found the problem which was that I did not call the variable. 

For the colours I played around with the fill and the stroke, some bright some mellow and plain. Bright colours did not really fit well with what I wanted my letter forms to be as they were inspired from the moon in the crescent shape. I ended up settling on a blue grey white colour scheme which I think fit really well. 

The animation part I wanted my letters to rotate and fly out of the screen for some but all should rotate in some way. I was going to go with one that did not rotate however I figured that since it was arcs it would make sense for it rotate. I like the animation with the fast rotations of rotating around each other and how they snap back to the letter shape like a gravitational pull. 

Overall I really enjoyed this project, I like how my letter forms turned out but I think if could have added more had I thought about my letter forms more and refined it. However it was my intention to make it simple and elegant. Had I manged my time better it would have been better. My finally letter form I am not satisfied with it but I like how it turned out in the end. 



pos2x - draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y - draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x - draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y - draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle - the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 - rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 - rotates the inner arc
