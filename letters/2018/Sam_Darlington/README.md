Alphabet nearly completed, not as updated in program.

I have created and saved parameters for all of my alphabet up to the number 3. I have not yet added these configurations into the program. I am struggling in program to get the full alphabet to show on one page currently.

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
