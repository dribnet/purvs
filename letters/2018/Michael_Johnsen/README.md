Each of my letters is composed of a constant circle, and two triangles that change position, colour and rotation. This simplicity allows for few parameters to change between letters.

The three parameters per letter:

rotation1 : rotation of the first triangle

rotation2 : rotation of the second triangle

offsetx1 : x offset of the first triangle relative to the circle

offsety1 : y offset of the first triangle relative to the circle

offsetx2 : x offset of the second triangle relative to the circle

offsety2 : y offset of the second triangle relative to the circle

colour1 : colour of first triangle

colour2 : colour of second triangle

I am happy with how my final turned out, as the font is simplistic, and yet still readable. It isn't obviously straight away, but finding out what symbol is what letter is definately doable. My choice of colours was simple, as I really like the blue of the example code, and so i wanted a colour that would represent negative space, and yet not blend in too much. I also didn't want it to take over the letter form. So i made the triangles grey to show that they are both a part of the shape, yet not.
