Final

This is my final Design I have decided to keep the addition of the turquoise colour as I believe it makes my letter forms more easily deciphered from one another. Also, I like that it is not simply one colour and also that only some shapes include the turquoise and others do not because I think it creates more interesting letterforms. Furthermore, it makes words as a whole more interesting to look at as there are only some parts which have this colour in them.
