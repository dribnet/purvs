## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

My concept for this project was to originally create a ninja type of font then I got inspired of some stuff of Pinterest and made it into more of origami shape alphabet, since I already love origami. I went the color green because to make origami you need paper and to get paper you cut trees and trees are green but also brown but green is a cool color. 

At first I had several issues in making the coding and then when putting the letters into the alphabet. The issue with the code was every time I tried to put in the x and y values in the shape it seemed to always either never show up or show up in a really weird location,  like it would either be lower than the original x or it would be somewhere else on the screen. I thought at first it would have been my shape which was originally “quad” which for me I realized that it was actually pretty complicated so I decided to change it into a similar shape which carried similar traits which was the triangle. The triangle was a lot easier and took less time. It ended up getting resolved and the coding became a lot easier when my tutor explained it to me. The shapes I tried to keep consistent but It was kind of hard so I simplified it significantly from my original idea. 

The code became significantly easier after the tutor explained it to me.  There are 12 parameters in total which is seen in the pointy parts of the triangle. Before there was around 16 in my original design but decided to scrape it off because it was kinda hard

And I did some refining in the end make some shapes in the alphabet actually look the the intended letter.

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
