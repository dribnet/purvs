## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

So this is the final version of my Alphabet. It was primarily inspired by Neon signs and was appropriately named NeonType.

This idea came about because I liked the idea of having a "board" made up from neon lines, that would seperately turn on different lines to reveal different letters and other characters. I also thought that this would be interesting as some characters were going to be quite difficult to represent as there is a limited amount of lines to choose from, so it was going to be a challenge to show each character, without them looking the same as other characters.

I decided that for my transitions rather than do something where the points fly and form to create the next letter, the old lit up lines would fade to black, and the new lines to turn on would fade in. This was partly done because I thought that it would be a bit of a different spin, but also because the idea is that this is meant to be a static neon board that only really changes the lines to lit up, so it doesn't make a lot of sense if the lines fly around to for the next letter.

The purview files has links to 3 files:
	- Experiment1: The test were I messed aroundf ith moving the shapes just to see if I could come up with a better idea than what I had
	- Experiment2: This shows the first iteration of the alphabet, which is the style that I went with and refined to make the final version.
	- Final: It is the final version

Final Paramters are:
  - lines : an array of 1s and 0s that let the line algroithm know whether or not to "turn on" or "turn off" a particular line
  - red : Contains the amount of red 
  - green : Contains the amount of green
  - blue : Contains the amount of blue
