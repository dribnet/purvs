Polyfont
=======

When I started this project I had the sketch idea of using a polygon for my base letter shapes. There were 18 parameters which all moved the rectangles on both x and y axis and they also rotated. That made up the polygon but I knew there needed to be less parameters so I decided to use a vertex to create my polygon shape and ended up only having 8 parameters even though I could have had 12 which would have made this project way easier, but I wanted to challenge myself. This eventually made me think of a style that the letters could go in so I made them look more retro by having 2 other shapes behind with retro colours to top of the style choice.

I learent in this project how parameters work and that less is more sometimes and I learnt how to graph things better using code. I feel like I could have done better with changing the given code more, but I am happy with the outcome of my work.
