I wanted an alphabet that used simple shapes and involved transparency.

My design went through many changes throughout the design process. My original design only had three circles, but I quickly realised that I needed something else to make the letters more unique, so I added a line. I felt that adding another circle would make it too crowded. I also changed the colour, stroke and size of the circles throughout.

I played around a lot with colour. The colour of the little circle is different for the letters and the numbers, so they can be told apart. I eventually settled on the big circle being black and the smaller one being red for letters and green for numbers. The red/green adds some colour which I think the characters needed, after looking at the monochromatic designs I previously tried. The black makes the red/green stand out. The line, the middle-sized circle and the stroke of the little circle are the same colour as the background and so they appear to cut through the large circle. I like this effect because it makes some interesting shapes, unlike having the circles and line sit inside the big circle like I'd originally planned. 

To give a sense of connectivity between the letters, I didn't want the placement of the circles and line to be random. I only used 6 different line placements for all letters and numbers so no line position is unique. Some of the placements for the circles is unique but most use the same positions. This also means that when writing a word some parts line up (as shown in the second example in the exhibition) so I wanted my letters to touch since I like the way this looks.


For the interaction I made the line fade in/out when changing to/from letters that have and donâ€™t have lines. This is because I wanted to link it to the transparency I used for the little circle. I wanted the change in colour between letters/numbers to be a smooth change to match with the fading line. I added the parameters: "alpha", "r", "g" and "b" to make these transitions work. For the fading in/out of the line, I had to put the line parameter into all letters even when it's not seen. I chose to put the line in the centre for the letters that didn't have a line showing, so the line fades and moves to/away from the centre when changing letter.

Overall I am happy with my alphabet. If I had more parameters I might have add in another line to make the letters more unique. 


The twelve parameters I used:

*posx1: x position for the little circle
*posx2: x position for the medium circle
*posy1: y position for the little circle
*posy2: y position for the medium circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
*alpha: the alpha value of the line
*r: the red fill value for the little circle
*g: the green fill value for the little circle
*b: the blue fill value for the little circle
