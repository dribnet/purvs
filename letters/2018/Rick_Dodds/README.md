## Primitiv letter form

### Letter Construction

Each of my letters is composed of primitive shapes: a grid of nine circles, a large circle, a square and a set of triangles. The grid attempts to outline a general shape of a character where the circle, square and triangle are meant to be indicative of connecting lines curves and angles; and the general style of the character. For example an S is curvy in profile so a circle is used to illustrate this, whereas a 5 has both angular and curvy elements so a square and circle are combined to denote this. One early redesign was changing the original Diamond to two triangles because the cross effect was significantly more versatile in suggesting letter shapes. 

The 12 parameters per letter are:
  TL, TM, TR, ML, MM, MR, BL, BM, BR : controls the circle grid 
  "Square": controls the square
  "Circle": controls the circle
  "Triangle": controls the two triangles

### Inspiration

The main inspiration are Maori paints for the colour scheme, which I felt fit well with the theme of primitive shapes and the idea simple and elegant, as opposed to overconstructed. Additionally it lead me to use more muted colours and rounded strokes to give a more organic and less harsh feel to the letter forms.

### Aim

My main aim with the letters was to convey as accurate a representation of the original character as possible while just using primitive shapes. Importantly without reposition or resizing which I felt added too much flexibility in drawing, creating more of a “bad” font effect as opposed to images representative of letters which was my goal. The main drawback of this approach was that by default it lead to extremely boring animations. To remedy this I added a fade in and out effect, with a final pop added by adding and removing the stroke; which had the added bonus of removing the bug associated with overlapping colours and fading not working the same.
