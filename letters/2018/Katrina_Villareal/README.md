I like the outcome of my final design and i think changing the stroke weight of my lines made my design a lot more interesting and not as simple as it was when i used three lines that were all the same stroke weight. The smallest changes can really change the design and make it look a lot more effective and sucessfull. I wanted my design to be very readable instead of it being abstract. There were some challenges as I could only create the alphabet with three lines. The only abstract letters and numbers that do get confusing is the letter E and O and the number 8. The others are very straight forward and easy to read. 

These are my 12 parameters i used. 

line 1 :

["x1"] x co-ord of first point
["x2"] y co-ord of first point
["x3"] x co-ord of second point
["x4"] y co-ord of second point

line 2 :

["y1"]x co-ord of first point
["y2"]y co-ord of first point
["y3"]x co-ord of second point
["y4"]y co-ord of second point

Line 3:

["z1"]x co-ord of first point
["z2"]y co-ord of first point
["z3"]x co-ord of second point
["z4"]y co-ord of second point
