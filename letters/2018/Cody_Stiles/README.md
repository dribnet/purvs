Glitch Alphabet

<<<<<<< HEAD
Final
=======
This is my final alphabet, which I have named 'Glitch' due to both the pixel-like form it takes as well as how the animation seems to 'glitch out' when transitioning from one letter to another.

The animation works by removing any 'blocks' from a letter that are not needed for the letter it is turining into, while keeping any 'blocks' that the current letter shares with the next letter. Once the old 'blocks' are removed, the new ones come in, forming the new letter.

I like the style as it reminds me of a retro computer system that takes a little while to load even the most basic of things - such as words and letters.

The colour scheme is soothing and pastel-like. The colours compliment each other and work well with the over-all forms of the letters and words they form.

I'm very thankful for all the help I was given by the tutors and have enjoyed learning and discovering many new things with this project.

My parameters are the 12 boxes that are either on or off depending on which letter they need to make.
