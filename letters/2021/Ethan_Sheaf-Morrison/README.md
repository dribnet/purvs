<b><h?>NEONVOLT</h?></b>

My typeface is called "NEONVOLT". It reflects the synthwave inspired neon glow and the sharp and angular geometric shape design.

<b>Description</b>

My typeface consists of a geometric custom shape that morphs and adapts to create unqiue letterforms. The custom shape uses many of the parameters to manipulate the location of each vertices. The remaining parameters are used to translate and maniuplate the overall shape for both the blue and orange version of the shape. Using two versions of the custom shape i am able to complete complicated letterforms with fewer variables. The original custom shape can be seen in the default character. 

<b>Process</b>

The inspiration for the typeface came from a number of places included this <a href="https://spin.co.uk/work/bbc-creative"> identity </a> by SPIN UK and generative design concepts such as sediment mars by Alessandra Villaamil found <a href="https://programmingdesignsystems.com/shape/procedural-shapes/index.html"> Here </a>. Originally I wanted to explore 3 dimensional isometric space (examples of these attempts can be found in previous commits). The limitations of the brief pushed me in a two dimensional direction (however a true generative and adaptive 3 dimensional design is something i would be eager to explore). The previously mentioned limitations however led me to consider a stronger symmetrical core shape that evidentally reflected the limitations of the code. This realisation was a turning point for project as embraced the angularity of the letterforms in more abstract ways and I began looking at synthy aesthetic influences that ranged from TRON to Daftpunk


<b>Animation</b>

The intention for the interpolation between letterforms was to take advantage of the singular shape design and how the forms can naturally morph between each other. The goal was to make an almost organic flow which creates an interesting juxtapostion with the geomtric design. I think the end result gives my animation a sense of character, especially in the "ambient" transition when a letter is transitioning to itself. 

<b>Reflection</b>

There is a lot I would have liked to have done with my typeface. Besides ideas that I would like to explore and realise later (of which i have mentioned previously), there is some edges i wish i could have polished. For example the the letter forms of 2,6, 9, F, and J Are not as refined as i would have liked, i think this is an issue with my concept more than lack of trying to make them work. I think to really realise my intentions for this typeface, I would need to reevaluate the core aspects of my code, and to build a new system that could achieve the full dynamic and refined version i have in my head. That all being said, I really enjoy the end result of this exploration and think i have pushed it to a form of polish that i think is possible to achieve given the parameters.
