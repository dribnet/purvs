## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2


## My final alphabet is called ‘lemonade’. 

### Idea
My initial idea was derived from a wheel and being able to draw all the letters using straight lines and arcs. When I first came up with the idea, I had no idea how make it fit within 12 parameters until I realised, I could fit them into true/false statements. On paper I came up with different ways of using the lines and getting the output with the least parameters. In the end I had 10 parameters for my alphabet. I had never used true/false statements in code so it was fun to do!

### Interpolation
My interpolation is quite simple yet effective. Because I did not use proper numerical parameters It was hard to make my letters move so I chose to focus on the wheel. I decided to make it rotate around the centre point to represent the function and movement of a wheel. For my interpolation, I also decided to make a map to control the opacity of the wheel. When the letter goes from 0% to 90% the yellow gets darker and then back to its light colour. I really like this as it brings a more aesthetic approach to my alphabet and makes it look like it’s glowing. While I tried to make my actual letters have a more interesting interpolation, I found it difficult and decided to focus more of my energy on the wheel movement and the look of it. 

### Design
My lemonade idea came quite late into the process from me playing around with colours. Once I had my general design, I felt quite stuck and didn’t know how to make it stand out, so I spent a fair bit of time choosing what colours I wanted for my wheel. I had turned the wheel yellow when I realised that it looked more like a lemon than a wheel. I really liked this idea and decided to progress it further. I think it really elevated my design and made it a little bit more complex. I dived deeper into the lemon theme by making the background a lime inspired colour. I really like the way green and yellow look together. One of my problems was making sure the letters were understandable and didn’t merge in with the lemon. I spent lots of time working on how to make them pop and stand out. I wanted to go for a simple look as I didn’t want the page to get too overcrowded and overwhelming. To make my design look better I included a white and yellow ellipse to represent the rind of a lemon. 

Overall, I am happy with my design. I think it has come a long way and I’m proud of myself for challenging myself with something different! I managed to learn a lot of new coding tools!

### Code problems/Decisions 
* My interpolation works quite weirdly. Because it is not based on numerical values, the interpolation will only work in either interaction.html or exhibition.html. I have tried to fix it, but it never works in both. Due to this I have done my code so that the interpolation will work in exhibition mode. I did this because I feel that exhibition.html is more important as it is where the final alphabet is being presented properly. 

* I had not changed my index.html for all my commits until recently, this is because I wasn’t aware of how to do it. I have done it for the last few commits though. 

* Somewhat Glitchy opacity map. It doesn't interpolate in order, it is a little random. It still looks great, and i like how it is a bit different.
