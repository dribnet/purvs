## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2


For my project I was inspired by the swiss graphic design movement, hence my minimal color pallet of blue, white, and black. Also I used 4 simple shapes that utilized the negative space in the background. These shapes were a white ellipse, blue ellipse, isosceles black triangle, and a white rectangle. Creating the letters with only these shapes was definitely challenging because the letters were also programmed to layer on top of each other in a certain order which really limited their versatility.

I was able to create mostly all the letters in the alphabet except for X. Also H, 4, 3, and m are noticeably difficult to read however I think I made the most of the shapes I had decided on.

when using the editor, the white background makes it difficult to see the white ellipse and white rectangle. This issue is fixed in a separate commit where backgroundSlider is functional.


The paramaters I used were:
(there are 21 paramaters breaking the limit of 20, however 'backgroundSlider' is only used in editor and does not effect the letters apperance).
