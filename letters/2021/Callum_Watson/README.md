## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

For my Project I wanted to create something very easy on the eyes that flowed nicely and kept a reasonably smooth undertone throughout it. I had a lot of mental health trouble during this project so I was a bit late to the party but I feel I did okay with the time that I had.

I started by researching styles of typography and fonts that piqued my interest and one in particular was a spherical smooth graffiti style font that I wanted to try and emulate. Originally it had very scratchy and splattery linework but I wanted to clean this up for my rendition of it for the project. I focussed a bit more on readibility and how I could keep the entire type face within the boundaries of a simple circle. 

I had a few issues, one of these being trying to figure out how I wanted my numbers 0-9 to appear, however I thought that using random shapes and linework would be a lot easier and look a bit nicer than just using some really tacky line placement to try and make numbers like 4,5 and 8. I also decided that I would do a little face for my default character as I thought this was also quite fitting for my chosen theme. In the end I am happy that I went with this decision, I think the freedom of being able to make the letters and numbers as abstract as you wanted in the brief really helped me here as I could kind of just experiment instead of being stuck on really fiddly parts for a huge period of time. 

I decided on the green black and white colour scheme very early on and I am glad that I stuck with it, I was struggling to find out in which order I wanted to use them in but ended up settling on the black background with green strokes and white fills for the lettering. Initially I was considering doing a navy blue stroke with white lettering on a grey background but I thought that the final colour scheme looked a lot nicer and suited the project more. 

There are a few parts I would do different if I was going to redo this project, that would be to try harder at making sure everything flowed a bit nicer, I realised some of the letters like B and D dont really sit well with me and I wanted to fix them up a bit and make them look a bit nicer but I can live with it. 

I also wanted readibility to be a big part of my project, I feel like I can reaad it pretty well and I am thankful that it turned out like this. 

I named my font "seatown" because I like the way it sounds and I also really liked the way that it looked when it was spelt out in the font, I love the X's and the circles, I also really like my default character :)
