I knew that I wanted to use triangle, circle and rectangle to create my alphabet form from the start.  
I was trying out a pastel colour theme and cute rounded style at the beginning. However, I soon found out there will be too many variables if having triangle, circle and rectangle at the same time, and I wouldn’t be able to edit my form as freely.   
Therefore, I did some research about drawing triangles or rectangles in a different way, and managed to source a better code from the assignment reading.    
The base idea doesn’t change, I’m still using circle and triangle, but I substituted the rectangle with sine wave and used trigonometry to draw the triangle.  
Sine wave is still in a line form (but wavy), and it would still deliver the idea of a line or stick if I use it in my alphabet. The way that it moves between alphabet also adds more character to the letter.  
Using trigonometry to draw shapes allows me to utilise the variables, and there’s a lot more flexibility on the shape itself, in case I want to change anything in the future. 
I’m personally interested in neon style art and flurol colour, so I decided to use the neon theme colour palette to start with. In order to add a stronger characteristic to the alphabet, I added glow effect by manipulating the colour transparency.    
The glow effect makes the whole alphabet “jumps” out from the screen even more.   
I also tried out a new code reference which is blendMode(); and this enables me to manipulate how the colour overlaps.  
Since I really want to emphasis how the sine wave is moving in the animation, so I created a map that forces the wave to start moving from its shortest length to its target length.  
The name of my letterform is PARTYPOP because the colour and the interpolation is eye catching in a way that it pops right into your eyes.  
Overall, I’m satisfied with how the design communicates with the audience, the animation almost looks like it’s flashing to the next letter. You could almost use it as your screensaver and have your favourite words changing around on the screen with this letterform.
