Alphabet / font title - Neonnite


INTRODUCTION:
Neonnite is a bright and curvy font, bulit entirley out of lines and arcs. Neonnight projects bright and colorful lettering comparable to an neon bar sign seen on many urban citys. Before this assesment, I had never properly utiilized arcs, so I used this assesment as  perfect oppitiunity to leaen and utulize them as the main aspect for the font.

IDEA DEVELOPMENT:

sketches - 
I first started this assesment trying to utilize 4 basic shapes and use them to intepret them in as many different shapes as possible. After sketching 2 different alphabets on paper, I gave it a digital sketch where this design of utilizing 2 lines, an ellipse and a sqaure quickly became rudamentrey. https://i.imgur.com/Cuh4vjM.png (skecth 1). Unsaitified by the look of my first try, I started again from scratch. I decided todo another 2 on paper sketches where I would utilize arcs. Ive never properly used arcs to draw in J5s, so I thought this would be a perfect opitunity to try. The sketches were intended to be able to be made with only 2 lines and 2 arcs which resulted in this - https://i.imgur.com/nYzICfE.png. From here I started to digitally sketch my new alphabet into sketch.js with no color ideal differences apart from the utilization of arcs. 

insperation -
It wasnt until me and a flatmate were watching the disney movie cars were I got an idea for the neon 50's/60's bar sign athetic. A diner sign looked similar to the A in my paper sketch which paved the way for the color sceme and a 50's futurism look. https://i.imgur.com/fmrbMYa.jpg (insperation - fun fact: the A is heavily inspred by the image). I know its odd but it inspired the athetic. 

color - 
From there I started working with a bright color pallet on a dark black backround. Originally I had a color pallet of a pastel  yellow pink and blue (https://i.imgur.com/BzVgDoi.png), But I decided istead to keep the strong red and yellow lines and utilize the pink and blue for the arcs after seing the shape of the A looking better with 4 different colours instead of 3. Thse bright colors felt appropiate since they were meant to feel harsh futurisitc neon colors from the movie tron, yet retain alot of classic neon soft light from irl neon lights. Originlly I was going to add a glow, but decided against it to keep it simple.


TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT:

parameters - 
Using 4 shapes on the 1st idea utlilzed 16 paramaters. with the introduction of 2 arcs, the start and stop from both of them added another 4 which put it up to the max amount of legible paramters (20). This meant i could control the x and y position of every shape, the width and height of every shape and the start and stop point for the arcs.

letter data- 
At first most numerals within alphabet.js were random with whatever worked with the digts that would replicate whats on paper. This would lead to some numerals being -800 or 400 which would take awhile to fix, but after getting to know the arc a bit better, I manged to put all numerals between 0 - 100. apart from that most things fell into place quite natrually. 

Editor - 
The editor was a bit wonky for some paramters, but I managed to use to to create a very few letters. I didnt use it since I had already done most of the letters by the time I set up the editor.

Animation - 
Animation was diffcult for me, since there wasnt anything that I could truley fully get behind. I decided to leave it at defult since i belived it looked the smoothest. I like how the arcs spin into place before spining into shape, overlaying the lines, but it still feels a little janky. I didnt focus to much on animation but I do enjoy watching the arcs spin into place.

TEST:
From there I continued on woth my alphabet with the principle that each shape must be shown, each letter must have resemblence to the english alphabet, and must retain the 50's futuristic bar esk. To test if it was readable, I got 2 flatemates to read words that displayed on the exibition and try and guess the word where after about 2 minutes, they were guessing correctly most times. I also tested myself and I can say im pretty fluent with this font now.

PROBLEMS AND ERRORS:
- At first my fork wasnt working for a good few weeks. Still never figured out why but that got fixed about 3 weeks into the assesment
- editor was a bit janky with some parameters. I didnt think it would be worth the time to perfect.
- When looking at the % of each letter in the interaction, It is chaos and I have no clue why. I have no idea how to fix it entirley, only for specific letters.


REFLECTION:
As a font itself, I am very pleased with the final result. As a flatmate put it "Looks like something youd see on a youbee poster". So ill take that as a compliment, I sucsefully Utilized arcs to create an alphabet that utilizes a common aethetic. Sadly The Interpolation and animation didnt get that much time and attention which make them feel a little lackluster and not to the same standard as the font itself.I didnt struggle much with the code and enjoyed creating each indivudal letter which made the assement enjoyable. In the end im glad to have a better udnerstanding of arcs.
