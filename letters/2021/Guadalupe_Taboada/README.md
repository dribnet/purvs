Final readme

ðŸ¤“ Introduction 
My final alphabet is called "powerflo" which tries to reflect power and happiness. for my final version I decided to join my two main ideas and create a last alphabet. I used the idea of â€‹â€‹incorporating a small graphic that is the flower with the smiling face similar to my first example and from the second I followed with the same idea of â€‹â€‹typography. try to create something out of my comfort zone as it is a bit unstructured alphabet and plays with geometric shapes.

ðŸ§  Concept
To develop the idea I based myself on a retro hippie style. I wanted to create something visually cheerful. When I started to create the alphabet I thought who would be the best user and I thought it would be very fun for children to play with this alphabet so I tried to create something that catches their attention, that has bright colors, that looks fun and interesting at the same time

ðŸ’œ Colour
Mainly in Latin America, many women fight every day for security, equality and justice. the range of violets is the color they use to represent this fight and it seemed like a good idea to use it and add a flower in honor of all the women who fight every day. I always try to choose colors and characteristic things that represent something in each of my designs.

ðŸ“¹ Animation
For the animation I decided to keep it simple since having several different geometric shapes generated something organic that seemed perfect for the type of graphic I decided to use.

âœ… Parameters
For the project use the 20 allowed parameters. It was quite difficult for me to have the limitation of using only 20 parameters but at the same time it forced me to find new ways to try to represent what I wanted.

ðŸ’ª Things to improve
I would have liked to be able to rotate the flower and change its size, but due to the parameters I used, rotating it would break the structure I wanted to achieve, so I chose not to.

 ðŸ¤¦ Problems
I had a lot of problems with the terminal and update my code periodically. I think I wasted a lot of time trying to fix it instead of improving the code.


<!-- Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one -->
