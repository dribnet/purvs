## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

The name of my font is Songbook.

This will be my final commit. I have gotten my code up to a reasonable enough standard for submission. Although I should have been working on this steadily through the semester break, giving me time for further iterations and experiments, I am still happy with where I ended up.

When looking for inspiration I was at first going to adapt a fantasy based language, examples being the Hylian alphabet from the Legend of Zelda franchise, or Alien Language 1 from Futurama, but adjusting the characters so they more closely recognised the English alphabet. I however turned this idea down because I did not just want to recreate an existing font, or find I don't end up with enough changes to make it my own. I then decided on the sheet music idea after discussing it with a fellow student. From the beginning I knew I wanted to have the letters morph into musical notes before ended up as their final letters.

Further ideas I could adapt into this with further experience could be a sound element, where a pitch that matches where in the alphabet a letter is found, and the morphing music note would adjust it's height to where on the music stave it corresponds.

The first part I started on was creating the elements of the music note I needed. Once I had done that it was tricky recreating each letter with what shapes I had to work with. Some letters like W and S were especially difficult, but I felt I came to a good compromise. It was a great experiment in seeing what works when all you have is some rather abstract shapes to work with. I did find I was able to adapt to both sharp and curved letters. Once I had worked it out, the editor was an invaluable tool in recreating the letters.

I did find by the end I spoiled myself with the amount of parameters I programmed in. I finished with 18 individual parameters, but I ate up several through requiring both x and y control of individual elements, but often scale and rotation too. I could have solved a few of these through custom shapes and clever use of functions, but I felt making the letters seemed challenging enough.

Overall, I did enjoy this assignment, though I found on some parts I struggled, which is largely my fault for leaving things so late. I am finding myself more familiar with the kinds of things you can achieve in P5js, and this was good practice.
