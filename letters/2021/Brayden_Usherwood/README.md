## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Phoebe allowed my random variable as it did not affect my letter form and was more for mood setting and their changes don't change per letter.

Each of my letters is composed with two main circles. The  position of the first circle is fixed, but the location of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the planet.d
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

Each circle also has colours associated to it.
  * `ColourPlanet` : Changes the planet's colour in sets of 4.
  * `ColourSun` : Changes the sun colour based on number, letter or blank.

Lastly is the shadow which has 5 positions.
	* `Shadow` : Changes the shadow position. 0 blank, 1-4 corresponds to each planet position.

Sketch updated with a design potential and also changed preview and thumbnail to match. Design idea is the solar system. The planet moves between 12, 3, 6, 9 to make 4 moves. Blank is in the center.
The sun colour indicates if it is a number, letter or blank. Black is white sun with black planet in the center.

Added Stars and then added shadow to the planets while making the atmosphere darker. Also added a small moon

I tested my orbits and decided I liked the flower looking one as it gave it some depth and interest. It is a unique look at gravitational field design. 

My design is made to continue with the whole space theme my designs have had before. It's also based on webdings. Each letter changes either colour and/or position. The sun changes to indicate either number or letter and blank is distinctively different. I very early on liked the idea of space theme and webdings design. So I slowly iterated on it. I made my gravity field flowerlike to give both some design interest and segmented colours to stagger it and make it look like the field gets weaker. It also allows the planet to stay on its orbit and will be in one of the four high gravity areas of orbit. The colours also changed during the iterations at the start to make them look unique but later it was designed so the colours looked like they were of the same shading but different enough. This makes everything work better together. The shimmering stars use radom that was allowed as it didn't affect the letter form to add a better visuals. The moon is for added effect that it is a planet and sun.
The Design lean both in being a flower but also an orbit within the lines being magnetic waves. So it takes a bit from both. The colour of the sun is also brighter hue so that it looks like it admits light.
