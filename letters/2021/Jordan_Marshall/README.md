FONT: FUNHOUSE

My final typeface is called "FUNHOUSE", as I believe this font to be very playful from first glance.

My alphabet contains quite distinct letters/numbers some are more abstract (size, width and height are purposely inconsistent) than others but when together they form a functional Typeface, but alone they still provoke the eye. One could say this typeface would be more targeted to a younger audience, but my intention would be for it to be used by all to just add a little bit more fun to their day.

 In my design I wanted to acknowledge the mixed varation of stroke and width size of art deco. My final colour palette and use of geometric shapes was heavily inspired by Bauhaus. I took colour and geometric shapes and used them in a way that is readable but not lacklustre. "FUNHOUSE" is all about making the mundane a little more fun.

 I orginally started with a more calming approach for my deisgn, with beige and light colours with a contrasting blue, but I decided not only did my Font look better but it is more effective, and readable in these striking (primarily) primary colours.

 My process was a lot of development, my ideas changed the more I learnt, and the more research I did. I used quite a few perimeters, coming in at 18. I believe having this many helped me achieve my ideal design, and an effective one. I also used my interpolation to continue on this fun aesthetic, with a fast effect that almost ressembles a bubble popping whilst drifting away from the centre of the default form. From this assesment I learnt how majorly a colour palette can change the tone of a design, and how important it is to just step back and look at your work.

24/03
Played with alphabet and added D, next I want to add another rect ti my design so I can more clearly distingush the letters from each other.

Also setting up the code on my laptop.

20/04
Decided to change my theme for my alphabet
Playing around with adding more parimeters
wanting to create illusion of negative space for some letters by making them the same colour as the background


22/04

I've been playing around wih transparency (I stlll want this shape to still be yellow)
Also added two more parimeters
I've now done up to letter L

26/04 

code is now uploading to git from my own computer, for some reason I had two ps2 folders!

I finshed my alphabet, I'm not just going to further refine my design and work on transitions.

experimented with a new colour palette + tweaked letters

quite like this palette

My alphabet gets more complex has it goes on, the letters/numbers become more an more abstract but even so when together they form a fairly functional alphabet, but alone they provoke the eye.

 - also need to make sure all of my letters fit into their bounding box

 27/04

 Tweaked most letters to fit into boundry squares, some still need adjusting.

 Decided to go with the name 'FUNHOUSE'.

 Also changed my display words, and made my exhibition my default image.

 28/04

 Commented all of my code.

 Tweaked most of my letters and numbers so they feel cohesieve. 

 Chose my animation, went for a bubble, fast effect almost as if characters are residue left over from something.
