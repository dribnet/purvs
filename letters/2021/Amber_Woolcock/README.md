## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Font Name: Eclipsed

The inspiration behind my font is solar eclipses. I created each letter by having the main certer part of the letter remain the same, while the planet, moon, and comet move around in front of the sun, covering up certain parts to then reveal the shape of the letter. I edited the interpolation so that the planet and moon get bigger in size before shrinking, so it feels like they're orbiting around the sun. I created the sun out of a sin wave circle, which I then layered a few on top of each other slightly changing colour so that it created an ombre effect. I also created the moon and comet out of a sin wave circle, but I made those ones have 2 y values so that the curve is irregular making them look misshapen. I made my code be more focused on what I can do with functions in the "draw_letter.js" file rather than with more parameters in the "letters.js" file.

I wanted my font to be more abstract, as I find illustrating with code really fun. My design started off really geometric - which I did like, but it just felt too simple. I didn't feel like I was being challenged very much as I was just using skills I already knew from last year. Using sine waves was the thing that inspired me to create something space themed, as the 'circle' I created reminded me of a sun. So while my code initially might be less readable than before, I'm far more proud of it since I pushed myself to learn a whole tonne of new skills. 

I think you can really see how my code has developed through all the different commits. Once I 'learnt' my alphabet, I found it more readable, and even though some letters are a little similar they're different enough to me that I'm able to distinguish between them fairly easily. Making some have the planet be larger and others the moon definitely helped with that. If I was to do this assignment again I might try to go back to a more geometric style and make that more complicated (just to challenge myself to to a different style), but I'm definitely happy with my outcome. Overall, I really enjoyed this assignment.
