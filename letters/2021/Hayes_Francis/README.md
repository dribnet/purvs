MOUNTAIN, a font which illustrates my up-hill battle with creative coding. This font is inspired by a bauhaus design and a recent music cover from Jackson Wang.

My font is made up of two different shapes, triangles and circles. These shapes are being controlled by parameters within drawletter.js and are being manipulated into different forms in letter.js. I used the red, black, and white colour palette consistently throughout each letter and these colours were inspired by the Maori flag, as I originally thought about doing a culturally inspired font. I decided to keep the red blocks in the back intentionally so it looks like the letters are being cut out from the background. This is where I took inspiration from the Jackson Wang cover. 

To begin creating my typeface I started with figuring out the parameters for the two triangles. I found it rather difficult and confusing to process the code from drawletter.js into letter.js. As the triangles use multiple x,y points it took me awhile to finally get my head around how the points are being drawn. Due to the limitations of the brief, I only decided to add the circle toward the end as I realised some letters and numbers were going to be very hard to understand without extra visual cues. The circle was easier to code than the triangles as it takes fewer variables and I found it greatly impacted my overall design. 

My font used a very basic animation and interpolation. In all honesty, I still haven't quite figured out how the interpolation works but I have managed to give it a consistent animation. The letters almost pull down from the top left corner of the square. I would have liked to do a more intricate animation but my coding ability limits me to what I can do. 

Overall, I am pleased with my final result of this project. I think my font successfully illustrates letters and numbers and clearly differentiates each one. It uses a consistent theme and colours making it a coherent design. In the future I would definitely have added more techniques with utilising the circle or another parameter, as well as perfecting my interpolation. My favourite part of my design would have to be default key because it defines my feelings towards coding: although it may feel like a struggle, it is always rewarding once you reach the top! :D
