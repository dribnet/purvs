## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

For this project, I decided to draw alphabets using the domino shape. There are 14 dots in total, and each postion of the dots cannot be changed. However, the colour of the dots can be interpolated between white and black. By not changing the position of them, I can restrict the number of variables and come up with ways to draw each letter. Also, it does not destroy the concept of my alphabets being a domino tile as the dot positions are the same as a domino is. 

I initially decided to draw brallie alphabets, but I thought that each letter would not look distinctive enough, so I chose to colour the dots so it could look close to alphabet fonts. For the numbers, the dots are coloured in the way numbers re counted on dominoes.

To distinguish between the alphabets and numbers, I coloured the domino tile and middle line with opposite colours.

As a result of interpolating the colour, the dots fade to the next alphabet when you type in the editor.

At first, it took quite a while to get used coding in both letters.js and draw_letters.js, but I eventually got used to it. Overall I enjoyed this project!
