# Notes:

 ## Define multiple means of describing local coordinates of a pixel within a given tile 

 Fracting (Grid)

 Hexagonals

 Barycentric Isometric Triangles

 Irregularity is ok, *even desirable*

 Temporal and spatial looping is key

 Continuous cycles

 No janky loops

 Seamless looping in all dimensions

 The coordinate system never skips due to 'running out'

 Wallpaper is somewhat regular

 What is "time wallpaper?"

 A wallpaper is a sample of a space including a number of repetitions

 Wallpaper has rythm

 Viewport dimensions are given
 What is the period?

 The idea is that the period is short enough for the repetition of the features
 to communicate as a device, yet long enough for the loop itself to be interesting.
 
 Mixing & Concurrency vs cyclic repetition:
 Two or more instances only need to be iterated over when they are involved in a dependency.
 Sonic mixing and alpha blending are examples.

 ## Visual vs comparison

 Comparison does not neccessitate a dependency when presenting to the comparator.
 A repetitive image is presented at once, it is up to the viewer to decide the operation order.

 Our eyes can freely scan left and right naturally but navigating time is more laborious.
 We 'expect' temporal experiences to be provided in sequence but we have no such requirement of images.
 We dont even read text in a serialised pattern. 

 Images are multiple things in different places at the same time.
 Sonic signals are pressure samples at different times.

 Any use of repetition or instantiation of representation in a single timeslice affords concurrency of 
 different states.

 A wallpaper rolls out "slices" of a spatial loop so we can see them all at once.
 It parallelises their comparison.

 Any temporal animation of the wallpaper rolls the whole thing back up again into a sequence that we can
 only experience by watching.

 "Playing" is the presentation of a sequence, one item at a time.

 Difference between pictures and sounds:
 You look at a wallpaper, you see multiple slices at once. The order in which space is navigated
 depends on the viewer.
 You listen to music, you hear things in whatever sequence is played or set by the musician.
 

## Fugues:

 Voices are heard at once with offsets 
 There is repetition in the rythm and melody, and there is mixing with concurrency.

 Spatial concurrency may be analogous to an alpha blend. Multiple things at the same place or time.


 Escher made visual fugues
