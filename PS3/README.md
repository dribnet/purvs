## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Added my own image for testing. There is currently problems with the images for Preview and Thumbnail not downloading properly, so we are waiting on a patch for that to be fixed. So far other than the downloads there seems to be no problems. I made my own mask and changed some of the pixel count and scale of those pixels.

Edit:
I have fixed the Thumbnail and Preview by manually changing the sizes in Photoshop, this is only temporary until the real Thumbnail and Preview downloader is fixed. I have also played around further with the pixel size and count as before it was hard to make out anything in the image.
