## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

I've started thinking more about what my theme will be and the movements I want to confey. With this first attempt I only worked on one face and have started developing the concepts that I will follow

At the moment I'm leaning towards pastel colours and a certain style of building faces. focusing on the rosy cheeks, small eyes and big nose. This goes along a sort of flat, minimalistic representation of animals.

UPDATE

started developing a 2nd face, will still have to go back and add detail but for now I have to move on to the third face and also starte playing around with the sliders.

UPDATE

I've now completed all three faces, I'm aware that my part two goes in a completly different direction and style to part one, however I was still thinking about what I wanted this project to consist of and am happy with the change. I've now completed the three faces and added to all the slider to create the effects i wanted. Now, I'll move on to the randomizing.

UPDATE

I've now been working with randomizing. I've decided t start with to add all 3 of my faces, can potentially narrow it down later but wold rather take away then add for the final. I've got slight things and changes happening with each face every time you click to randomize. So far I like where the work is going, struggled a bit to get all the faces in but learned a lot.

UPDATE

I've now been playing around with my choices of randomness. The freckes on the panda are now planned out and you rarely get a face with all the freckles. I will for sure come back to this. 

UPDATE

I've been experimenting with the layout and how I want to present my final work. I initially tried to present them in a lot of rows, with a lot of faces but had some difficulties with that and didn't quite like how it was going to turn out, so I've now reduced the faces and centered them. I think it adds a nice effect and makes the arranging and the amount of faces dislayed limited, so in some intenses you only get one pig and lots of monkeys giving the random effect a spotlight.

UPDATE

project is now complete. I've added some styling to the background and kept a minimal amount of faces of screen. the smaller changes that you only get sometimes include the pig smiling, the monkey with his eyes open and the panda with all freckles. I kept my layout and animals very minimalistic and am happy with the result.
