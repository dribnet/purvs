## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

I have focused my project around randomizing features of monsters made from basic shapes and making a fun, bold and bright design.

The faces have a few features which can be altered. The number and shape of the eyes can be altered, as can the number of horns.

The mouth and teeth can be altered to change shape, to range from a wide open mouth to a closed one, with big front teeth.

The ears also change shape, and can sometimes not appear at all and the faces can rotate.

The colour of these characters also varies, with their appearing as varying shades of blue and green and the background can also change.

Finally, to bring a bit of life to these characters, their eyes move slightly, depending on the position of the mouse.

One-horned characters appear less than the others, as they are more rare, and the distribution was to appear based on mouth position but I felt this made it look too cluttered so I went for a simple line in the middle.
