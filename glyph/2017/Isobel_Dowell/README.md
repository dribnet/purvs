### Final Glyph

For my Glyph system I was initially inspired by the idea of rotating rectangles since I feel like you don't see this very often. I then wanted to add depth to each icon to make it look iconic, I did this by adding circles to the inside of each icon. I found that once I had done this the icons looked more like suns which I thought looked quite nice. 

I wanted the Hue to effect the rotation of the rectangles in that when the hue was low the rectangles make a circular shape and when the hue is high that they rotate around and bunch up together to represent a higher hue. I had a few problems achieving this since the rectangles started to overlap as they rotated however I fixed this by changing the variables. 

I wanted the saturation to effect the colour of the background circle and the sun so that when there is low saturation the background is black and the sun is white, then when there is high saturation this inverses so that the background is white and the sun is black. This caused a few problems in that you couldn't see the sun in the mid point because due to the inverse the sun and the background could be the same colour. I fixed this by blocking out certain variables so that the background and the sun couldn't be the same colour.'

For the brighness I wanted the inner circle and the rectangles to grow as the brightness increases. I learnt how to map properly by doing so. 

For the spot system I decided to make the colour orange to further express the idea of the sun. I wanted the orange colour to be very vibrant which I achieved by making the brightness 100 whenever there is orange. I also wanted the inner circle to grow with the colour so that when there is the orange hue present, the suns are very vibrant. To add texture to the images I made the orange colour appear when the background is black which I think looks cool. I also added texture by making the inner circle grow with the orange colour. 

I found this project very interesting since I liked the idea of the hue, saturation and brightness of a colour effecting the glyph system in different ways. Through this project I learnt a lot about mapping, for loops and rotation which I think are very valuable skills that I will be able to use for future projects.
