## MDDN 242 Project 1: Dinner Leftover Clock

### Cecilia Hu

My clock was inspired by the leftovers of a dinner. Whenever we start to eat, there will be less and less food on our plates as time passes. But when we are full, the leftovers on the plate will not be reduced anymore. Therefore, leftovers can also be symbolized as "stagnant time." At the same time, leftovers are also eternal, it will not be reduced again like dinner. These two common characteristics of leftovers and time prompted me to complete my project this way.

The Maeda Clock exercise helped me a lot and I learned how to use map to help me complete my result. Especially how to use two opposite maps to make continuous animation. I had a lot of trouble trying to complete the exercise, but because of this experience, my main clock ran smoothly.


In the beginning, my idea was a dinner clock, with the food on the plate representing the hours, minutes, and seconds. The cuts of meat are cut more every hour, the broccoli one more per minute, and the peas one more per second, but the food should not increase as time goes on, but should decrease as time goes on. But the reduced food was not conducive to reading time, so I had to give up the idea. If I plan to make a countdown stopwatch, then I'll go ahead and use the dinner idea.


I also had a problem making the rotation of the second hand, and I didn't realize that the range of the second hand was 0-59 instead of 0-60. I found that my second hand could never complete a full circle, and I thought it was my mathematical formula except for the problem, and I kept revising it until I returned to the first line of comments. The same thing happened with the hour hand, but this time I had experience, so it was solved quickly.

After most of the programming was done, I felt that the picture was empty, and it didn't feel like a leftover meal. I added three more bouncing peas and some sauce.

Overall, I enjoyed the project, I did feel at a loss for some new things, but when I solved them I felt very satisfied. I feel privileged to be given time to draft and reflect on my ideas before starting a project, so I don't have to become aware of a problem halfway through the project.
