## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README

Sun & Stars by Isla Jones

My clock that I designed uses the milliseconds which is represented by the green planet which is orbitting the seconds, represented by the purple planet. Which orbits the minutes which is represented by the blue planet, which orbits the sun. The way these planets orbit one another is like how clock hands work on a regular clock and that is how the minutes can be read on this clock. The center of the sun has a growing orange ellipse which is an indication of what hour it is. Another way to tell the hours is by the stars all around the screen are representing the hours. Every hour an additional star will appear. As well as this to give my clock more movement, the stars bounce up and down, and every minute the screen slowly changes between pitch black and a dark grey colour. For the alarm of this clock, a strobe a black and white flashes will appear and make the stars glow. 

All of the code used in this project is code that I learnt in class and that I used from examples given to us. I didn't source any code from any websites or other sources.
