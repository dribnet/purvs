## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README

Update this file as you go along to record your progress.

My project started with the first week of stetches based upon the examples shown in class, one of them was a round clock with multiple objects orbiting a centre representing the hands of an analogue clock. To this end I created three different clocks, one with lines that extend across the shape and disappear when they hit the side, one with rotating circles each representing second minutes and hours. Then moved on to a clock with rotating shapes with the inner ring spinning for seconds and the outer shapes representing the minutes. 

In the second week I managed to get the Maeda clock somewhat working representing time passing and the alarm with the strokeweight and lerpcolour attached to the seconds value.

For week three and four I was sadly sick with a strep-like infection so was only able to get the circles working on my main clock and finish the Maeda clock. Was also dealing with brain fog and issues concentrating due to lack of sleep. Also ran into significant issues with the spinning of ellispes so reverted back to idea three with the rotating shapes in a round clock. My goals for this week were to compelte the Maeda clock with strokeweight acting as the alarm. I spent far too much time on this idea. 

In week 5 I had a serious mental health collaspe and decided to shelve the project and complete assignment 2 instead and submit what I had. If I had compelted it I would've made proper art and used pngs and collections of shapes rather than just general spinning and translation. Ultimately I am very unhappy I had the
