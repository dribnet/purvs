## MDDN 242 Project 1: Zen Octo' Clock

### README

#### The Idea
The idea was to have bubbly clock hands that lays on top of each other. Each hand would be indicated by different colour and would react it's physics with each other. I knew that was a stretch, but that was the main idea I wanted to push. The final outcome seems very different, but overall the idea was derived well from the sketch and precedent. 

#### Maeda Clock
My Maeda Clock script may look like a mess, but theres a good reason. I tried starting with the "Conway's Game of Life". However, after 3 days of being stuck in a constant headbanging, I realised I was unsatisfied with the outcome. So I recreated a different maeda clock. To make this clock more interesting, I added my own personal flair to it.

#### Precedents
I was inspired by @maxdrekker on Instagram and his works that uses simple geometric shapes to create aesthetically pleasing graphics. I also like how much he used gradients in his work. It's super clean yet vintage looking.

#### Reflection
I rewrote the code (clockDraft.js -> clock.js) because I realised when creating the alarm how messy my scripting was. It was a bunch of speghetti. I rewrote the code so I could work on the alarm feature in sync with the overall clock feature. This had a effect of cleaner code to work with, and better legibility. I was able to add a feature that seemed daunting before; light mode and dark mode. This really added an additional depth of feel. If there was one thing, I would modify or add (if I had more time), I would probably make the base shape go CRAZY RAINBOW when the alarm went off, or added some noise in the background to really give it texture and life. One thing, I like about my clock is how effective the small details are: drop shadows, glow, the little pulse.

#### Attribution
In this project, I was inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maxdrekker/?hl=en"> @maxdrekker </a> on Instagram. 
I also used some code from various places for some functions: <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/form-star.html">Stars Function</a>, <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/form-regular-polygon.html">Polygon Function</a>, and the font choice I used was  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/bahnschrift">Bahnschrift</a>. 

#### Random Tangent
Anyways, thats me done I believe. What else do I need to do? Coffee and sleep. If you are interested in the progress of this project. I wrote it all in updates.txt. Bye.
