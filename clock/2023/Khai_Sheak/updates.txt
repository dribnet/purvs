I have decided to recreate Conway's Game of Life Clock originally designed by John Maeda.
I have created the first step which is to create the grid background. Now, I have to try and figure out how to target specific parts of the grid. and make it change colour. I've given the each square on the grid, a coordinate. Hopefully, this can help make the process easier.

I used classes to create a square... and is able to place specific square on the grid. Next step is to find out how to make it know it's next to another square.

I have changed my method to using 2d arrays to create grids. I also created a possible shape using arrays [0 and 1]. 1 represents true and 0 represents false. if it's true, then the square will light up red. this method should make it easier for shapes to detect the nieghbouring squares's state.

I'm probably going to admit defeat here. I'll figure out how arrays with classes work some other time. Right now I should focus on the main alarm. But before That I'm not yet satisfied with how the maeda clock came out. I will try to recreate a different clock. hopefully this time it will be a little bit faster.

I changed my maeda clock to a different clock. This one I had a better understanding on how to break it down and recreate. It was a lot easier that I decided to put my own twist on it.

I found a sketch that I liked and found potential in. I was inspired by @maxdrekker and his works that uses simple geometric shapes to create aesthetically pleasing graphics. To start with I first made simple circles making it overlap each other. More hour = more circles. Secondly, I moved the circles over to then they would all touch the edge of the overall background circle. These would rotate around based on the seconds. Lastly, I turned those circles into squares using p5js polygon references.

I was looking over my inspiration's design. I realised how much he used gradients in his work. So I decided to use lerps to create the look. At midnight, I found out I didn't know what the seconds was because there was 0 hours as 0 is midnight. Because of that, I made a smaller star outside the background polygon. It felt bland so I added some glow to it. It only requires 2 lines 
  drawingContext.shadowBlur
  drawingContext.shadowColor
I liked the look of this, so I added a backgrund drop shadow on the background polygon, this really enhanced the look of the clock.

Found a way to make minutes show. Made every second, the color would pulse. And every minute it would rotate.

I rewrote the whole script because it got too complicated to read the speghetti code I made. I remade it, it's now 4AM but I can now understand the script better and easier. Overall, I'd say it's completed. However, there is an error. Debugging isn't possible since there is a new error line whenever that I try to debug:
  "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')"
I will need to check this out by hand in. And create my readMe.

Finalising my clock and descriptions. I finally fixed the problem by changing else{} to else if(){}. The pickiness of coding language is worse than english sometimes.
I have now changed the title of the clock to Zen Octo' Clock (Ten O'Clock). That's when I actually named it, I'm not joking.
ReadMe file has been written. It's now time to submit.
