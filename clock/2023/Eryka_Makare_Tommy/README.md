# Pacman Dupe Clock
## Eryka Tommy

Initially I wanted to create a clock very similar to the game Pacman. I wanted the ghosts to chase pacman around and create an array of x and y values for pacman to follow so that he had differnet routes to follow so it looked somewhat random. I also wanted to add ghosts that would chase pacman. I soon found this to be a little more complicated than anticipated so I simplified it a little using examples shown in class like the bounce effect shown to make an object swing back and forth/ up and down. I also stuck to one straigh route for pacman to follow as it was easier to code and looked cleaner. 

In later class sessions I began working on my maeda clock following one of the examples given. I used the idea of creating lots of ellipses to form the digits of a clock and experimented further by implementing a if staement to change the colour of the background in a strobe type effect switching between 2 colours. This was good practice for lining up ellipses and getting a feel for where x and y should be.

Towards the end I began thinking of alarm ideas. Initially I wanted  very similar to the game having the ghosts chace pacman then when the alarm is on evrything inverts and pacman can now chase and eat the ghosts and gain more points. I even had the idea of even having a full circle in the middle like pacman slowly open like when it dies in the game and display the message "game over". 
I decided to yet again simplify it and make it more obviious by making the ghosts change colour to the "vulnerable" ghost(white ghost). Incase that wasn't enough I made it so that when the alarm did go off I'd have multiple Pacmans emerge from the one pacman and go in two different directions.
I also changed the colour of the digits on the clock to RGB values (already blue so I have it strobe between red and green) which ties in nicely with older games colour schemes.
