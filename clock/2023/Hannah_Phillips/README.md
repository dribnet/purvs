Title: goddess Maeda clock by Hannah Phillips

my uploaded sketch is of a lady and a sun. I want to have the sun pulse to represent seconds, while adding a flower in the background per minute. once it has reached 60, it will reset.
for the hours, the position of the lady and the sun/moon will change to the placements on a conventional analogue clock.
the colour for am and pm will differ. light being am, and dark being pm. the sun will change colour to resemble a moon for pm too.
I am still deciding whether to add numbers to be more functional or just have it as a visual experience.

I feel I have achieved what I set out to do. my clock has an alarm that flashes different colours, it has multiple objects reacting to the millis, seconds and hours. it has a transition from day to night and night to daytime. (The only thing I haven’t don’t was change the colour of the sun to a moon. but it's too late now). I feel it is quite calming (unless the alarm is active) which was the aesthetic I was going for. 

I have used artwork of a digital drawing I did in November 2022. I have posted it on social media and my art station account. I used the lady assets from the picture and duplicated the arms. my inspiration was to create a goddess like lady and make my clock a visual experience rather than a classic clock.
I feel I left things too last minute, (even though I had a flu) and missed out on experimenting more. I got a bit confused with arrays, so I didn’t end up using them. I initially tried using chat got to try draw a flower, but it wouldn’t produce me one I was happy with. I went with a simpler approach. I like mine better.
for the alarm I made the background flash lots of colours. I reused some of the code that I had used for my music visualizer from last year’s creative coding 1 class.
i really appreciated Khai's help with making the ellipses pulse. I was a bit slow picking it back up in the first 2 weeks, so it was helpful having his input. I also found bouncing ideas ff other students in the class was very helpful.

I feel proud of my end design and outcome. I feel for future projects I will need to be very strict with time management and ask more questions.
my favourite part of my design was making the flowers. I feel like the pulsing was an effective feature to add.
