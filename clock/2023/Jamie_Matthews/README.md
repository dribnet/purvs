## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### Digital Sink Clock by Jamie Matthews 

My digital clock idea was inspired from an hourglass and how it fills up over time to represent a certain time. I wanted to recreate this abstract concept but without directly copying the form of an hourglass to give my design more interest. My mind immediately went to filling up tubs with water so I decided to pursue a water tank process starting at a leaking faucet. This concept wasnt in my initial brainstorm however. I started by looking at cogs or using colour shifting as the time of day changed but these both seemed out of my scope so I decided to go for a more reasonable approach. The creation of my clock started by simply lining up 3 rectangles to the time variables and having them fill up space as time passes using a map. I then neeeded to figure out how to create the dripping water from the faucet. From a lecture example of a bobbing ball, we were shown sine curves which I used to create motion in my drop. I chose to use the motion of a sine curve because it was slow in and slow out which created a more realistic drop compared to a linear motion. To create the effect I just hid the drop on the way up so it only looked like it was falling every second. Once I had the basic framework done I sketched up a background with my tubs and the faucet and imported this into my code. after lining everything up I had a basic functioning clock which I was very pleased with. To further enhance the appeal of my clock I developed the realism by adding smoother motions in the water rising up and emptying out of a tub. This was definitely the hardest part of my coding as it took me a long time to wrap my head around the concepts. and also alot of trial and error. Finally for my alarm I felt the most appropriate idea would be to have the sinks overflow and fill up the screen with water. This helps divide the alarm on and off states very easiliy and ties in nicely with my concept. Overall I am very pleased with my clock and alarm. I think it looks aesthetically pleasing and has a satisfying motion which is eaily interpreted as a measure of time. If I allowed more time I would have focused on creating a more realistic overflowing sink when the alarm went off.
