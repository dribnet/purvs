### Outrageous clock Final

Changes from original idea:
-instead of having 3 sections of the candle for hours, mins, and secs, I chose to seperate them and have the mins and secs displayed in the flame, whilst the hours can be seen on the body of th candle.
- also decided to go on without a wick purley because I like the idea of a floating flame, and it looks more aesthetically pleasing.

Idea of the candle explained: 

Basics: the drips that start from the top of the candle each represent what hour it is currently, eg: 3 candle drips = 3 o'clock. The drips flow down in sequence with minutes and a drip is completed once the minute hits 60.
the inner flame(yellow) grows and fills the orange flame every second, whilst the outer flame(red) slowy grows every second until the minute is reached and then shrinks and begins once again. Thus every time the yellow flame is completed the red flame increases in size.

extras: 
-The background is a darker yellow in the  early morning(0-6) and grows lighter until it reaches 6am o'clock, at 6 the background is at its brightest until
6pm where the color begins to darken once again.
-There is a small list of numbers down the right side of the candle to give a more accurate display of the minutes through the wax drips.
-The candle sways left to right, purely to look cool and give the flame a more realistic look
-AM and PM signs change accordingly
