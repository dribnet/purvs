### Final Clock

This is my final moth clock. I am quite happy with the outcome and have enjoyed overcoming the challenges I faced with the help from the tutors during this assessment.

The idea behind it is that the growing ellipses that are tied to the milliseconds are a representation of the shimmering that real-life moths sometimes possess. I based the colours on an Emperor Moth and decided to make it a pixel moth as there is a lot of room for failure when making a realistic-looking moth with curves and small details - even the smallest mistake would bring down the entire look of the project. A pixel moth, on the other hand, is easier to make and - due to it not being based on reality - has far less of a chance of looking 'fake' due to incorrect details and forms of the moth.

The alarm is a red bar along the bottom of the screen and I chose to have this due to a combination of taking inspiration from the tutors and keeping the overall clock peaceful and almost delicate by excluding a large, obnoxious flashing alarm.

I personally enjoy the overall look and aesthetic of my Moth Clock the most.
