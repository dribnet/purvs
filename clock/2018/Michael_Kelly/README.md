### Shifting Sands - Final Design

The above is my final design for CC2, the final design is quite different from my origianl idea of tipping blocks that more resebmled a digital clock, but I am much more interesed by this current design.

The design works by creating a block for each unit of time (ie second, minutem, hour) the blocks then proceed to bounce down a ground plane and off the screen.

When working on this current design I used the principles behind hourglasses and aplied that to a more abstract idea.

The clock also has an alarm function in which upon clicking on the clock a 20 second countdown will begin, upon that countdown ending a random number of various sized blocks will barge down the surface creating a wave of 'sand'.

Due to the way the blocks are created the blocks will not continue to be created upon entering debug mode, due to 'time needing to be active for the sands of time to flow'

Lastly I have really enjoyed coding this final design and look forward to future projects.
