### Dial Clock

The dial clock is a clock which has three rotating dials which tell the second, minute, and hour.

An indicator at the top of the clock shows what time it is.

In these recent versions, I've changed the colours of the clock to look like brass, with some shadows around the dials to give it a 3D look.

The background changes from day to night when the alarm goes off. I figured this should work well as an alarm, because who has an alarm at night? And if you look at a normal clock and see it's night, then you know you're VERY late.
