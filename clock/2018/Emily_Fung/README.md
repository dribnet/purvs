### Snake Clock

For my final version of my clock I didn’t changed the clock time ticking and how it is displayed because I like how it looked. However for the alarm, when you set it the snakes appear slithering across the screen on a loop until the alarm goes off then they disappear. Once the alarm goes off a different set of snakes appear and they are a dark and faster version of the previous ones. As well as the clock shakes until the alarm is finished. 
I thought the clock didn’t loop when I tested it in the debugger and some other things, so I tested it again but at midnight and it loops! 
I like how my clock turned out, I think it was a good idea to change the colours of the snakes so that they fit better with the rest of the theme. 
Next time what I would do better is do something more with the alarm snakes so they are more interesting than just watching slither across the screen on loop. As well as maybe turning the ticking seconds would be interesting to see them as small snakes ticking across slowly.
