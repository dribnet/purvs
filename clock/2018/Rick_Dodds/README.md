### Calcu-Clock - current build

The point of the clock is to help children work on their basic math skills by generating random math problems based on the time. The hours are a subtraction problem and the minutes are represented by an addition problem. Colour changes with time, with RGB values permeated across different axis and colour intesity increasing as minutes, seconds and milliseconds increase. Lastly the Alarm countdown is just the seconds represented as a subtraction problem, they rapidly changed every second, with the alarm itself growing the image onscreen.

### Calcu-Clock - concept

Clock presents simple math problems where the solution is the current time. The point of which is to let children practice their mathematic skills often. The alarm function requires the user to solve 5-10 math problems before stopping.

### Maeda-Clock

Snapshot of the 8th Maeda clock, chosen because it seemed the easiest to learn p5.js library.
