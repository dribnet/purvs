### FINAL CLOCK: Turrell Bling

Inspiration:

My final clock conforms to the simplicity and polychromatic design style of the legendary interior artist James Turrell. In particular, the multi-circular aesthetic derives from Turrell's 'Skyscapes' which is a large interior piece that responds to the sky via a single circular skylight.

Also worth mentioning that his aesthetic was a vital role in the making of Drake's 'Hotline Bling' music video.


Initial Ideas:

My initial sketches (made through photoshop) suggested analogue functionality through moving ellipses. I wanted to live by Turrell's simplicity so I knew the use of complex shapes such as quads with multiple edges is forbidden. I slowly realised that my idea of an analogue clock would stray from Turrell's abstract style as ellipses placed in an asymmetrical order is not aesthetically pleasing.

Iteration Process:

From there I started to code everything from the centre, creating a two ellipses which reacted to the seconds and hours of the day. I found that adding another ellipse which grew according to the minutes produced a clock which lacked the movement I wanted. This is where I implemented the neon arc which corresponds to minutes. It is white and glowing as Turrell favored using neon rods to add linear elements to detail extrusions in his otherwise flat interiors. I knew this arc would be essential for my Turrell Clock.

After coding the fundamental elements of the clock I added more ellipses bigger in size to create more depth in my clock.

The background changing colour every second is also a design decision I made with Turrell in mind. He used an amalgam of colours and I wanted to make sure the whole spectrum can be output in a short amount of time so the viewer is engaged.

For the alarm I re-utilised the arc to become a visual anticipation for the countdown, then I made the alarm action to be an homage to the Hotline Bling video.

Overall I am happy with my final clock, I think sticking to simplicity in this first project reinforced my coding skills to prepare for future projects.
