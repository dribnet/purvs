### Moon and Sun clock

My clock is based on the sun and the moon. They circle around the time in the center. Their positions are related to the time, for example, at midnight the moon is at the top while at midday the sun is at the top.

The background colour also changes based on the time. 

The stars and clouds positions are randomly generated to make them unique and interesting to look at. At night stars appear and fade away at sunrise. The clouds fade in after sunrise and remain there for the day before fading out again.
