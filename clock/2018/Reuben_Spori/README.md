### Cuckoo clock

For my final clock I have bassed it on a Cuckoo clock. I have pendulums that slowly move in relation to a format of time. This being either seconds, miuntes or hours. The clock face also displays the time.
The pendulums can also tell the time with how far down they are. Due the inaccuracy of this  added the clock face to tell the time more accurately. The background is also a slow gradient transitioning slowly as the day progresses.
The alarm I have set up has a count down where the doors open slowly showing a bird behind them.  As the alarm goes off the bird will "pop" out and spread its wings.

I unfortunetly havent managed to get a smooth transition effect. If I had figured this out I would have applied it to both the bird popping in and out smoothly and the pendulums going up and down smoothly.
