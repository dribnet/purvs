Final clock

In research and post-production I read about a water-clock, and the idea for my clock was inspired by that concept of when the water moves it physically indicates the changing of time.

For my clock, the idea was to have three rings,(seconds,minutes,hours) and on the border of each ring to have a small circle which travels around the ring like a clock hand. Then, each time the circle made a circuit, I wanted to have another circle appear creating quite some complexity.

I thought about how I can make it simpler while still catering to my idea, so I created the simpler circles which move horizontally, and still carry out the action of moving in time with time.


For the alarm I wanted it to be quite simple, and since the background is blue, the alarm just turns into a red background.
When the alarm is set, but not yet going off, a red sleeve slowly moves from the right. 
When the red covers all of the blue background, the alarm goes off, and the red changes to be a bit brighter for clarity.
