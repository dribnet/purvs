### Coded Clock	

This is the final itteration of my clock. I attempted to do my initial fan idea, but ended up going from circular motions and shapes to a more traditional shape that i favoured over the fan for the simplicity. I wanted the time on my clocks to be readable very quickly, but i also wanted to have other elements to look at. My designs are simplistic, and i have more than one clock to symbolise that time is never percieved the same way by everyone, and different people percieve time differently.

My alarm function imitates how when we are in a hurry, time seems to go much faster than normal. I have the hands spinning out of control to show the apparent passing of time much faster.
