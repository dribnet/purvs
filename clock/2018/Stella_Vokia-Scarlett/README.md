### Coconut Clock

My final clock is abstracted from a coconut, where the moving arcs are coloured based on the different layers of the coconut. The three arcs are coloured based on a coconut, the green of the exocarp, the brown of the endocarp and the white of the inner flesh. I also added hands to give more of a classic clock look which i like. As opposed to putting numbers i wanted to keep it simple by just putting quarterly lines to break up the time abut further. I put little shadows just to give the clock a little more dimesion so it doesn't look so flat. I have used blue as the background and laid the arcs in a yellow circle to signify the water and sun coconuts needs to grow. I kept my alarm simple by making it flash random colours which can be disorienting kind of as if how you would feel if you've been hit by a coconut on the head!

At the start getting back into coding again was daunting and I should have asked for more help from the tutors but found that once I actually got stuck into watching tutorials and reading about p5.js I was able to work consistently to create a clock that I am overall pleased with how the final came out.
