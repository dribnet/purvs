My clock is simple in its design, it uses clean lines and a clean look.
The clock shows only the hours and minutes in a format of HH:MM, where the hours are in military time(24h format).
The time passing is represented with the liquid level rising in all of the numbers in the clock, where the liquid level in the minutes corresponds to the seconds and milliseconds, and for the hours it uses the minutes as well.
Every number is made by using shapes, with the "3D" effect made by layering the shapes with different colors and adding lines for the edges.
The alarm is quite simple, the double dots in the middle change color, from white to red, when the alarm in on. And when the alarm goes off the dots flash both at the same time.
