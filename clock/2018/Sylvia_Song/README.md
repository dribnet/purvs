### final

This is my final clock. My Inspiration is from DiLou/water clock, which has liquid drop down from the top. So I came out with an idea to make a chemical liquid clock. I want it in a 2D design and has a sense of simplicity. It should be easy for people look at the time and funny as well. The liquid in the beakers are refer to Iodine clock reaction (the beaker which represent hours) and Phenolphthalein indicator (the beaker which represent minutes). Therefore, the colour of the liquid will change depends on what time it is. When I click, an alarm will be set. At the same time, a 'Warning sign' will be placed on top left corner. When the alarm go off, that sign will be removed and the biggest frame outside will turn into red.
