### Time Gimbal

My clock replicates Gimbals not unlike those seen on camera equiptment. It turns each axis corresponding to the time of day. The rotation on the Z axis is the hours, the X is the minutes and the Y is the seconds. I am happy with the look of it and pleasantly surprised in it's readability. Hope you enjoy.
