### Outrageous clock
this is the final version of the software clock, I used rotate function to maked the hours and minutes hands, and the background color would change with the hours, between 18 to 6 o'clock, the background would be dark blue, else, it would be light blue.

when the background was clicked, the alarm would run, and the text that show the hours and minutes would change the color, until the alarm equal 0, also the background would became orange and pink color if alarm number is 0.
