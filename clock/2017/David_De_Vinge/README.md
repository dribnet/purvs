### Organic Time

The Organic Time clock is now done; this is the final version. I think the project has gone well as I have kept to my original concept quite well. The Organic Time clock conveys fluidity and natural motion as intended. The colour scheme is warm as I wanted the clock to appear calm and relaxed. The alarm function has the intended effect by portraying natures violent aspects. Overall I am happy with the design and outcome of the Organic Clock. If I we're to change anything I would spend more time on the motion, expanding on the fluidity.
