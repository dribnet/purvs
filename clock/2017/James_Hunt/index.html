<h1>Final Clock</h1>

This is the clock in it's final form. It has a different design aesthetic than
I originally imagined however the purpose is clear. The purpose of my clock was
to confront the user with a number system they are unfamiliar with and thus are
basically unable to read. However in my original design the colours were going 
to overlap instead of be translate to a different spot. Ths change was made so that
the clock has a viability of being read. This is because my intention changed to 
that of wanting it to be theorectically readible so that people would be able to
learn rather than be confused.

Other than that the clock is rather unchanged, however I embraced my original 
philosophy with my alarm for consistencies sake. the background fades to black
as the numbers fade to white. This gives the viewer time to try interpret the
clock before the alarm goes of. However when the alarm is set off the flashing
black and white of both the numbers and background is meant to disorientate the
viewer into not being able to notice the changes. Furthermore the overlapping of
the white numbers makes it ambiguous as to the changes happening and what numbers
are being displayed.

Overall I think I was fairly faithful to my original intent and I am quite happy
with how it turned out. Use this resource to help: https://www.pharmabraille.com/pharmaceutical-braille/the-braille-alphabet/
