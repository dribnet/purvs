<h1>Final Windows 95 Clock</h1>

I mostly made aesthetic changes today. I added more comments to improve the readability of my code, I created a new function that draws a pixelated hourglass on the left side of the window, I improved the borders around the windows, X, loading bars and buttons, and improved the way in which the active and inactive buttons appear to appear closer to the Windows 95 look. I also made a slight change to how the alarm appears when the windows pop up. If I had more time I would perhaps look into improving the font used (the ideal font is MS Sans Serif with no anti-aliasing - something I donâ€™t think it would be possible to achieve with P5.js without considerable effort), having the hourglass rotating slowly, and having the buttons react to being clicked by becoming indented briefly.

<h2>Overall Design Process:</h2>
I initially came up with the idea of a Windows 95 style clock after seeing the loading bar demonstration with the map function. I thought that the slow progress of time could be easily related to the slow and sometimes infuriating loading bars from older Windows operating systems. I think it's an interesting idea, but I definitely chose aesthetics over readability/useability, at least to a certain extent. If I were to repeat this project I would make better use of functions, and use the translate function in order to make elements easier to move around and rotate if I wanted them to. Other than that I am quite happy with my concept and execution and I think I would use this clock in everyday life if it was on my wall, if only for the aesthetic value.
