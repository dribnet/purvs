<h1>Calcu-Clock</h1>

The point of the clock is to help children work on their basic math skills by generating random math problems based on the time. The hours are a subtraction problem and the minutes are represented by an addition problem. Colour changes with time, with RGB values permeated across different axis and colour intesity increasing as minutes, seconds and milliseconds increase. Lastly the Alarm countdown is just the seconds represented as a subtraction problem, they rapidly changed every second, with the alarm itself growing the image onscreen.
