This is my final submission for problem set 3.

PATTERN:
Initially I wanted my pattern to take the form of a mid-century modern style wallpaper. I went through with this intention for the majority of my experiments and after tampering a bit more my pattern came out only slightly mid-century and looks a bit more alien.

The main component of my pattern in the diamond grid. Getting this rotated and working correctly took the majority of the time, but once I had this done my base was sorted. It was around this stage I decided to make my pattern random so there is always a different outcome. I felt this was necessary due to the simplistic nature of the tessellation. 

The end result is something I would gladly print onto fabric and wear - it turned out better than I expected. If I could refine it a bit more I would work on the colours and perhaps some different shapes on the vertices of the diamond where the circles appear.

LANDSCAPE:
I struggled a lot with this landscape concept, but in the end I achieved a unique result. At the beginning I wanted to make a flat landscape which was reminiscent of 2D game. My initial idea was to have a layer of trees blending into a cityscape layer with a mountain range in the back and a river in the front. I did a few experiments with added buildings it became very crowded to look at very fast, so I decided to cut that bit out and continue with a simple mountain range in the background to give a little bit of depth.

The trees are on a grid and they have the ability to move within their grid location on both the x and y axis. This gives the forest a more natural look with trees clustering together and leaving gaps in the land. 

To make the random generation more interesting I added in different colour schemes which give the landscape the feel of a different time of day. These are a somewhat rare occurrence but give the appearance of morning, evening, and night. 

I think I could refine this a bit more by working on the multi-dimensional aspect. At the moment it looks a bit odd with mountain layers looking 3D and the forest looking 2D. I think it could also do with some refinement in how the trees generate and it becomes predictable somewhat quickly.
