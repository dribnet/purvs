FINAL:

To swap between modes, press 'w' for wallpaper and 'l' for landscape. The sliders are for adjusting the wallpaper only as the landscape is meant to be observed rather than fiddled with.


GENERATIVE LANDSCAPE (City Grid - Night)

My work for part 2 generative landscape was largely aided by the coding train tutorials by Daniel Shiffman on perlin noise (see link in sketch.js). 

The direction I then took this work in was initially inspired by development of road networks (if you imagine looking down on a country or state from above). I then developed this further with the concept of a birds eye view of how a city grid - such as manhatten - might come alive at night with activity. Starting first in key hubs and growing outward until every block is alive and active.
 

ITERATIVE PATTERN

I have used a series of for loops to generate my tiling patern for part 1 of assignment 3. I tried to design something that could not only be infinitely tiled but would look good at different scales (small diamonds or large diamonds). I narrowed the colours down to just two - which could be interchanged depending on the colours you wanted for your fabric, or to have as wallpaper in your room - as well as playing with stroke opacity for the final effect.

I have now also added 3 sliders that can be used to adjust the wallpaper to change the diamond size, ellipse size, and shade. However, this meant needing to remove the noLoop(); which has impacted the performance.
