For my wallpaper design I wanted to have clear segments that work together. The rows of solid dark boxes touching each other, and the rows of boxes which do not touch each other and have some negative space. The differences between the rows give the viewers something to look at and it helps guide their eyes across the design. The light and dark difference help highlight this and it also appears a lot neater.

The overlapping ellipses are given a size variance, so now they will overlap in more different and interesting ways, and the transparency allows each box to show the overlaying colours.

As the box pattern reminded me of a movie theater, I imagined that this wallpaper would make sense to be used there in theory, and so I skewed the colours to be more red to match the theme.

For my final Landscape design I modified my wallpaper design and tried to create an abstract landscape. I used random colour shades as rare occurances to keep the design interesting after long clicks. Some of these are very very rare and will not be found often. These colours are meant to abstractly represent objects that would be found in an Island setting. the white in the ocean represents stone, while the purple is an underwater object. the green represnts nature/trees/grass on top of the Island, while the shades of orange brown and red indicate uneveness in the land. 

I have a stroke that helps divide the landscapes, as well as my ellipse sizes based on perlin noise. There is always slight variance alongside the noise to keep the aesthetic interesting.
