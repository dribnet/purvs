17.2.MDDN342 PS3

I started this project with the intention of making a spider web style of pattern, but ended up moving more towards this electric or wave stlyed texture that is open to how it is seen by the viewer. 

The colours are intended to be complementary, and as the mouse is pressed, the pattern is generated, making it more powerful and vusually interesting before it fades away again.

The landscape uses this pattern as an abstract, wind styled texture, to add to a mountain range which has used a slightly altered version of the wallpaper code. I felt it was important to keep both elements of this program related so I have tried to change as little as possible.

The final element in the code are the soft clouds above. They provide a contrast to the jagged, harsh mountains below and sharp angles of the wind lines.

This is a well used scene, but I have tried to build it in a way with lots of lines and strong angles to bring a bit of character and an abstract point of view to it.
