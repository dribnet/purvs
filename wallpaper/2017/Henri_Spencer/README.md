Click to redraw.


I have added my landscape to the scene pressing the L key will draw the landscape. This section had me rather stuck as I simply didnt know what to do with it or where to go. I decided to use the style from my wall paper and turn it in to a simple land scape with some changes on how it is being displayed. It draws from the bottom up chaning the color to represent water, grass, rock and snow as it goes up. 

The wall papper hasint changed much I cahnaged the background color and added in a small chance that the they have stroke applied as I do like the look of it but it didn't want it to always be there.
