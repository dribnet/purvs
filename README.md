I have almost completed my full aplhabet and now have to add the numbers. With the intention with a new theme which is 'origami' and I decided to change the colors to light green to symbolize nature and tress :) 

I attempted to add shadows which worked at first then it gradually started getting harder so I kind of removed the whole shadow thing which I was going for. You can kind of see some shadows in some letters.

There were some letters where I did struggle with because of the shadow so I ended up simplfying it to make it a bit easier.


In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
