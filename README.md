## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2


I have now lined up all of the letters which looks way more clean and professional. Everything is mostly the same size now. I think that for the letter where there is only blank space I might put the fill shape in there to make them match the other letters better, i'll see how it goes. 

I'll also start on making the animations smoother and cleaner. I like how the c,d,e flow from one to the other. I want the trasitions to be like them as it's very satifying to watch. Some of the animations just suddenly pop up a shape which I don't like. I will probably have to add a size variable for the arc which wont be too difficult. 


<!-- I have now done all the letter and have done some of the numbers. I'm working on making everything look nice rught now. such as having the dot not coming out of the a and b. I also need to do some more linning up of the letters and making sure that they all fit inside the boxes. I'm currently playing around with colour and I find that having one of the shapes as just line weights and the same colour as the background give the work a very nice effect. This is complemented but the smaller fully coloured shape. I means that your eye is drawn to the cutout of the shape making it easier to determine what the letter is. I'm liking the new colour sceme as I feel it looks a lot more professional. I have also now trasfered all of the data from one computer to another so hopefully there are no hitches to the trasition.
