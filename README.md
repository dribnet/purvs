## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I was looking through a magazine one day and saw people holding the tools of their trade, always facing the camera. Always prominently showing the person and their trade or hobby clearly. I wanted to take these things and obscure them as much as possible. Anton, smoking his weed out front of his band's lockout, and Marie in front of the graffiti that she loves so much. I felt these images put more of the mystery on the person rather than the object, while at the same time dissolving the ego.  

In this experiment I am beginning to literally dissolve the individual themselves. I plan on doing a bit of a scale and fade away on the diamonds that makeup the subject's body. Thus further eroding the individual (yay) yet trying to retain some of the original intent of the photo.
