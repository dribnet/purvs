### Bird clock

Following on from my original idea, I decided to use birds for the hours, minutes and seconds.
Instead of keeping the birds in a clock style direction, I decided to make the birds fly freely.
The number of pink birds would represent the hours and the number of red birds would represent the minutes.
Since the number of seconds will get quite larger, I decided to have just one bird for the seconds where
its distance across the screen going left to right would represent the seconds 0-59. 

To represent AM/PM I thought I could either change the birds colours or have them switch direction.
