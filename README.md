## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Refining my design towards the final design I no longer have randomness in the people and instead have an overlapping grid of ellipses making the people still stand out whilst having some ambiguity about there specific features. The background is a key element in each design and is intentionally washed out with just enough clarity to get a hint of what / where it might be. There is a faint white crosshatched border around each person to further highlight them.

The theme I have chosen is friends and family as they are an important part of my life and deserve to be captured and showcased. I highlight them by making the background a clear secondary component in the output. Permission has been granted for use of them in my photographs :)

Each image has a custom mask made by me, 3 tones (Black, white, grey), and is processed with a grid of ellipses for the subject, white crosshatches on the edges, and the horizontal lines for the background.

The Code Is now tidied up, well commented, makes use of functions, efficient (hopefully), and takes about 10 seconds to run.

My favourite outcome from the three is the first as it has the most contrast and is the most striking. I mocked this up using a google maps screenshot:
