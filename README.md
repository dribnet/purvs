:memo:  
The lighter purple ellipse rotates around the centre based on the feauture of the letter. For example, A could be seen as a triangle / fan, so it has a fan shape in the middle. B has two little half circle on the side, and C is like a complete half circle.  *working on putting triangles* 

*25 March*  :sunny: 
Updating my sketch today, I chose to use rectangles, triangles and ellipses to create my letters.  

*30 March*  :umbrella: :zap:  
Working on getting things into draw letter js and looking at using the variables wisely to get the most out of it.  Starting to work in the editor, but nothing major has changed.  

*1 April* :umbrella: :cyclone:  
I want to have more efficient parameters, so I changed the way that I draw the triangle and ellipse.  
Code inspiration from the course reading, and using arc to draw ellipse so there more poetential in shapes. 

*16 April* :sunny: :sun_with_face:

I've started to crate letters in editor.html. I decid to let the arc size and Y position stay as a constant, so I can limit my parameters.

*17 April* :sunny: :umbrella:  
Finished my basic letter form today, what I want to work on now is to refine them a bit more and see what else I could do to improve it.
