## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today, I tested out a new theme. I wanted to use double exposure to show a person's homeland and how much they miss it. I've only managed to change one of the images and it does look quite nice but I think there's a lot more details I can alter. However, I think I should stick to the siblings theme because I may not have enough time to take oter images of other people and their homelands, whereas I could take photos of me and my brother anytime. I'll be working through the portraits during the weekend and focus on the code after that.
