## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

This alphabet is based of the symbol based language of the alien species Heptapods in the movie 'Arrival'.

I simplified the forms down to be less detailed, taking main inspiration from the circular, thick/thin, and black/white aspects of the symbols. Here is my ideation sketches from when I first came up with the idea https://www.flickr.com/photos/187301143@N07/49888399701/in/dateposted-public/ , and here is my a version of the alphabet I hand drew to get an idea of what it'd all look like https://www.flickr.com/photos/187301143@N07/49887880863/in/dateposted-public/ . I used two black cicle/arc symobols, against a white rectangle, to represent the two aliens in Arrival. One of the main messages in the movie is co-operation - it's only when all of the human country's work together that they are able to learn the aliens purpose. In this spirit, one of the main ideas of my alphabet is co-operation - you can only see the full letter form when the two symbols come together.

The thirteen parameters per letter:
  arcStart - start position of the first arc
  arcFinish - end position of the first arc
  arc2Start - start position of the second arc
  arc2Finish - end position of the second arc
  arc3Start - start position of the third arc
  arc3Finish - end position of the third arc
  arc3opacity - visibility of the third arc
  Size1 - diameter of the first circle
  Size2 - diameter of the second circle
  xpos1 - X position of the first circle, also used to position the arcs
  ypos1 - Y position of the first circle, also used to position the arcs
  xpos2 - X position of the second circle, also used to position the arcs
  ypos2 - Y position of the second circle, also used to position the arcs
