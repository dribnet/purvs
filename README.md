## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Ok so I have now realised that the animations aren't going to go as planned due to them not playing in the alphabet So for the time being I am going to try and see if there is something else I can do. 

Plans so Far:

	- Finish interpolation
	- Keep tweaking letter sizes

Current Paramters Are:
  * lines : an array of 1s and 0s that let the line algroithm know whether or not to "light up" or "turn on" a particular line
  * letterColour : Contains the letters colour
