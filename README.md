### The Wellbeing Clock.

My idea is to have a clock based off Circadian rhythm. However, in this case I want to look at the emotional wellbeing of a human during the day. Tracking sleep, energy levels, the weather (which effects mood), and general mood. This will be shown through several different loops around the clock in the center. There will also be an emoji kind of face that is the clock which will demonstrate the changes of emotion. I would also like to put in alarms for each of the things that are being monitored, so you could remind yourself that you need to get more sleep etc…
