I am using the pattern from my previous project as I think it could work quite well in this project. The focus of my previous project was about the layering of shapes and hopefully I can capture this again with the zooming in/out feature. My idea is to explore the depths of the basic geometric shape by starting with a zoomed out radial pattern and zooming in shows the layers of how the pattern is created.
