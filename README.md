My idea is to displaying large parts in machinery to small parts
In my case, the image will turn the Judah gear into a pinion.To show the effect of small technology in promoting the development of science and technology.

Start on working out the shape.

I tried with the class example to make it move and want to make it have a circulatory movement like gears.

Adding the zoom.

Adding animation.

I tried a new idea. To write by code calculation. I made 3 caculations when writing code. In line 35-54 of drawgrid.js, it can change different caculations.
