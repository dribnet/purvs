### Solar System Clock

Solar system clock first prototype

This is the first version of my coded clock, i managed to create 4 planets
which each represent a different unit of time and follow an orbit around the sun 
in the center. 

improvements for the next iteration could be making the planets get drawn in the 
correct order depending on whether they are at the front of their orbits or the back.
also some aesthetic tweaking is needed.
