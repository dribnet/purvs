## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For my photos I have three girls who are my friends. I took these photos while they were dancing a Samoan siva for VUSSA (Victoria University Students' Association) I wanted to capture the pose of how they are and also trying to create that texture and colour of the puletasi (The womans clothing). With this I tried to clean it up a bit.
