PART 2: DRAWING STYLES

This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

I have used a minimum of 3 sliders for each face, with the first face using all 5 parameters.

My first two faces I carried through from part 1. In part 1 they were looking at each other, so I wanted their eyes to be able to glance from left to right using the sliders.

My third face I wanted to develop something more human. I based this off Chucky from rugrats and went from there. You can adjust face size, glasses and ear position.
