## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I experimented with colour manipulation to emphasise the contrast between the foreground and background. In the white area of the mask (foreground) I picked out the colours that have more red than green or blue and multiplied the red and blue by 1.4 and green by 1.2 to make a more vibrant red colour. This was rather effective in the first and second photos as the red was initially rather dull and now it stands out a lot more. The third photo already had a bright red so it just made it even brighter which didn't change the contrast much.

In the black area of the mask (background) I tried picking out the dark colours where all rgb values were less than 100 and multiplied the green by 1.2 and blue by 1.4 to make a more greenish blue tinge to the dark areas. I like this effect on the first photo as it makes the colours more similar to the other photos and has less of a distracting dark patch on the left side. I don't really like the effect on the second photo as it makes some parts of the sand an unnatural colour and blends more into the mountains. It works reasonably well on the third photo as the shogi piece on the left matches the colours in the rest of the photos a bit better.

I think I will keep the changes to the foreground colours as I like that the red stands out a lot more in the first and second photos, but I might not keep the changes to the background colours as it only really looks good on one photo.
