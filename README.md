## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

**Title: Majestically**

My theme circulates appreciating stunning creatures inhabited on earth that we aren’t usually able to see in our daily lives. For this project, I decided to use photos I took back in 2016 of jellyfish at the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan in Japan. This was one of my most special experiences as I explored some parts of Japan on a studying abroad trip, where I was able to thoroughly learn about Japanese culture, history and traditions. Although this was 4 years ago, it’s very important to look back and reflect on special times and experiences I’ve had, which is what I wanted to convey through these images and my theme. 

At first I had some trouble with rendering, as it took far too long to render images, causing a lot of time loss. However, I was able to solve this close to the end of my experimental stage, which helped me a lot. I solved this issue by using a different browser.

One big issue I encountered were certain parts of the image not showing up the way I wanted to through masks. I tried playing around with values to fix this but nothing was satisfying enough for me. However, I ended up adding a grid background - an essential layer for the back and this improved my design by a lot in my opinion. After this, I was able to tweak a few values and I was able to find a satisfying outcome for all three images.

I quite like how the strokes of the lines convey an artistic vibe, as if it was on a canvas. I initially wanted to go with this sort of idea rather than working on pixelated art, as I wanted to make the images look expressive as possible. I’m happy with how each image turned out, however, my personal favourite photo would have to be the second one due to the different colours and the close up shot of the jellyfish spreading open.

Overall, this project was very enjoyable and helped me improve more on more code like elements such as for loops and if statements, which I wasn’t 100% comfortable with before. I like how each project of the course were very different from each other and I’m looking forward to doing more creative coding projects in the future.
