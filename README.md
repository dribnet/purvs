## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

Currently further refining the animation and trying to add more detail/a point of different as you zoom in. I have tried to move away from ellipses and add something else but felt that it didn't fit in with the aesthetic and just looked out of place. In saying this, I still feel like it needs something to make it better. Pretty happy with the direction it is going though.
