## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Initial

The images above are photos that I took in a graveyard in Wellington on the Terrace. These photographs focus on the relatioship between life and death, exploring how in a place dedicated to the dead like a graveyard life is sill abundant and thriving, with the death itself playing a large role in what makes the life (plants ect) flourish.
At the moment I still have the original algorithm applied as at this stage I am just getting used to adding my own photos and learning how to use the masks and code. I have added my own simple mask to this image that just seperates the gravestone(death)from the surrounding plantlife (life), the mask is just black and white at this stage.
At the moment my plan is to use my masks and algorithms to really emphasis my theme which is to explore the relationship of life and death. I am thinking it could be really cool to create the 'life' parts of each images with more curving lines/shapes, and then contrast this strongly by having the 'death' parts of the images in strong straight lines and shapes. I also would like to experiemnt with keeping the 'life' brightly coloured but desaturating the 'death' elements so that they are colourless, to further emphasis the difference between life and death which I am exploring in this project.
