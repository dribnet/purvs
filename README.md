## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have combined some of the code from the grid example to the original code to create a look that I am more happy with. I decided to go back to the cross-hatch look as I thought it filled out the image better. I may still change this as I continue to develop the design. I have stretched the tile width to be bigger than the tile height as I like the oval shapes created when the mask is white. My next step would be to think about adding a design to the pixels. 

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
