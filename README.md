Now that I have my Colours in. I have set it to randomly choose between them. I have however made the dfeualt colour slightly more likely. 

My last parameter is the bezier curve which ims till working out how im going to do without the inside of the mouth clipping all weird.

With the colours Im still a little unsure on some but they are a easy change.

I also made is 5x4 on the faces as I feel like lots of small ones next to eachother start to blend in so by amking them beigger and less of them they stand out more. Maybe thats a sign of me needing to do more variantion but im not sure yet.
