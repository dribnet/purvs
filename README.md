### Slit Scanning

After talking to Tom about my idea he gave me clarity to what I should do, I don't fully understand 4D and haven't done much 3D/WEBGL stuff so he suggested to work in 2D and to try focus on getting the aspect of of slit scanning to work and how I could incorporate/show time also. 

He had a drawing which explained what I should try an achieve which is what i'm working on now. But in order to understand how to translate slit scanning to programming I wanted to look at the traditional methods I found a video that summed it up pretty well and interesting ways slit scanning was used then found a site(www.flong.com/texts/lists/slit-scan) how to translate it digitally and how it has been used digitally to show this passage of time(4th Dimension)
