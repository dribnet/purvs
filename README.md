## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - Pre-final

I've reached the look I want to achieve in my final.
The unordered, hollow squares contrast against the ordered mosiac-tile grid.

I'm thinking for my final commit I'll erase the masked areas on people's faces and just leave the sky. I think this will create a 'different dimension' look compared to everything on the ground.
