## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Thank you for Bex's help and let me know where and why this bug is, I have too many parameters that made slider cannot control, I want to try to reduce my parameters, but the Rounded Corner Radii takes 4 parameters... I will try this..

And maybe improve my editor later, and some alphabets interaction is not good, I will try to make these looks better, I also still need to naming my alphbets.

The 20 parameters per letter:

  * `MainPosX` : x offset of the main body position
  * `MainPosY` : y offset of the main body position
  * `MainRadiusA` : radius of the Main body first rectangle with rounded corners
  * `MainRadiusB` : radius of the Main body first arc line 
  * `MainRadiusC` : radius of the Main body second arc line 
  * `RoundCorRadA` : main body first rectangle with top-left rounded corner radii
  * `RoundCorRadB` : main body first rectangle with top-right rounded corner radii
  * `RoundCorRadC` : main body first rectangle with bottom-right rounded corner radii
  * `RoundCorRadD` : main body first rectangle with bottom-left rounded corner radii
  * `PartPosX` : x offset of the second circle relative to the main one
  * `PartPosY` : y offset of the second circle relative to the main one
  * `PartRadiusD` : width of the second rectangle relative to the main one
  * `PartRadiusE` : height of the second rectangle relative to the main one
  * `PartCorRad` : rounded corners radii of the second rectangle relative to the main one
  * `StartA` : angle to start the arc1
  * `EndA` : angle to stop the arc1
  * `StartB` : angle to start the arc2
  * `EndB` : angle to stop the arc2
  * `StartC` : angle to start the arc3
  * `EndC` : angle to stop the arc3
