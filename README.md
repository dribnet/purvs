## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

My idea for this alphabet style is to have an isometric set of animating alphabets.
I will create this animation by fading in and fading out in between 
all "blocks" that formed the alphabet by playing with the opacity. 
I am also gonna fake this 3D style by just using 2D shapes drawn with vertex.



The parameters per letter:

  * `x2` : x offset of the second cube relative to the first one
  * `y2` : y offset of the second cube relative to the first one

  * `x3` : x offset of the third cube
  * `y3` : y offset of the third cube 

  * `x4` : x offset of the fourth cube
  * `y4` : y offset of the fourth cube 

  * `x5` : x offset of the fifth cube
  * `y5` : y offset of the fifth cube 

  * `x6` : x offset of the sixth cube
  * `y6` : y offset of the sixth cube 

  * `x7` : x offset of the seventh cube
  * `y7` : y offset of the seventh cube 

  * `x8` : x offset of the eighth cube
  * `y8` : y offset of the eighth cube 

  * `x9` : x offset of the ninth cube with colour difference
  * `y9	` : y offset of the ninth cube with colour difference

  * `x10` : x offset of the tenth cube with colour difference
  * `y10` : y offset of the tenth cube with colour difference
