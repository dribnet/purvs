### Clock Update


I played around with the code given to us and made an alternate version of 
my clock that I hope to finish with. I couldn't fiugure out how to make the minutes line stay drawn across the canvas. A compromise to this was to just draw some minute lines to the left and right, there wasn't much functional use to these I just thought they looked cool.
