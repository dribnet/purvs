So this is my idea so far. I went home and had a think about it and came up with something in terms of using the background colour to give the illusion of the letter changing. 

So as you can see there is actually an ellipse in the middle of the A to make it look like an A. 

 I am having trouble with some code to try and do the B, I also am still thinking of how I can do the B with these parameters, but I'll keep working on it and I'll figure something out.
