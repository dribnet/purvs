## Making more letters

Now that I am happy with my shapes, I have started to make more letters from D to M. I have been using the editor to make it faster to move around the parameters to get them looking nice, I just had to slightly adjust the slider values from when I first put them in so I could make all the shapes I wanted. The letters G and K look a bit strange with the length of the stick and would look better if the length could be changed, but it works fine with all the other letters so far so I will try to not make it into another parameter if it works for the rest of the letters as well.

I currently have 9 parameters;
	"offsetx": X position of the first leaf
    "offsety": Y position of the first leaf
    "leaf2Posx": X position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "leaf2Posy": Y position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "rotate1": rotation angle of the first leaf
    "rotate2": rotation angle of the second leaf
    "rotate3": rotation angle of the stick
    "stickPosx": X position of the stick in relation to first leaf
    "stickPosy": Y position of the stick in relation to first leaf
