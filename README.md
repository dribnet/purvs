## Night Courtenay

Some people like quiet nights and others like boisterous nights.
Wellington is a diversified city. Of course, the nightlife is always
colorful.

I wanted to enrich my work with characters, but then I found the night
and the lights more matching. I hope to show a different Wellington
through a sharp contrast of light colors. I took dozens of photos as
an alternative, and finally selected the three photos that best
reflected the lighting effects as the final version. I think that dark
and bright lights can stimulate people's vision.

I used Photoshop to cut out the photos, which took me a long time
because I hope to be able to show the details more comprehensively and
the effect will be better.

The initial effects of the experiment were not particularly
noticeable, and then the combination of a rectangle and a triangle was
tried to show the result of a pixel.

Regarding the color experiment, I tried a combination of multiple
colors and finally selected image one to image three. From the first
to the third, there is a sharp contrast between red and blue, and
there is a process of progressive divergence.
