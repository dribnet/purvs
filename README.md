The letter are made with 6 different vertexs and linked together with lines. I wanted to make the letter look somewhat "sketchy" so I added a loop to animate the letters. The box is a guideline for me to position of the vertex, I have not decided if I want to have that in my final.

The parameters are the X and Y positions of the vertexs.


  * `point1x` : X position of the 1st point
  * `point1y` : Y position of the 1st point
  * `point2x` : X position of the 2nd point
  * `point2y` : Y position of the 2nd point
  * `point3x` : X position of the 3rd point
  * `point3y` : Y position of the 3rd point
  * `point4x` : X position of the 4th point
  * `point4y` : Y position of the 4th point
  * `point5x` : X position of the 5th point
  * `point5y` : Y position of the 5th point
  * `point6x` : X position of the 6th point
  * `point6y` : Y position of the 6th point
