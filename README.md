## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Changing grid techniques.

Adjusted the constraints for the tiles so there is no gap showing (showing the background). The triangles are now close together.

Added in the rectangles again now that the triangles are close together. Also played around with these and swapped the triangles and rectangles to and from the subject and the background. 

I only tested this code with the first image. I will look at implementing it with other images and playing around with it more.
