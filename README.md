### Bubble Clock

My project is nearly completed. I managed to fix the jumping timings as well as fix the alarm going off code. Pretty happy with everything so far however i would like to change the font of the text which is proving quite difficult. I tried creating a local server through node but that didnt end well.
 i could run it with my tutor to see if they have any idea.
