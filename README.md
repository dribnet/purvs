## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today I have worked on refining my mask. I have also decided to outline the edges which give a really subtle change in the flower size. I think I might make some of these lines more bold to give more interest.

I was also considering playing around with the colour of the image however, I think that over editing my images with distract from my theme of showcasing colours and gradients from within the flowers. I think that it is important to not over do it when it is so easy to! 

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
