## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

 Today I updated the exhibition to make the transition smooth. Works well. After one night, I can clearlly see some of my designs were not as good as I expected, so I will change them, I will also make the 1-9 numbers' design today.

I might changed the color of the letter later, but for now I like it.

I also want to create code that can change the shape of the triangle so the design can fits my original I idea. (I wasn't able to make it looks like my original idea because I have truble makeing the triangle's point editible)

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
