## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Jun.8th 2020
I tried to make the difference between characters and background more obvious. But the overall effect doesn't seem to be harmonious.
The original idea was to use three shapes to represent culture, Chinese ancient coins, Japanese waves and Moroccan tiles. But currently the coin patterns has made the overall picture very messy. I am going to change the pictures back to food. The background color of the current picture is too messy and it is difficult to highlight the keypoint.
