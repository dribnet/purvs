PART 3 README

Following part 2, I have created series of face data which is saved in the face_data.json file. I stuck with the overlay mask theme and applied various adjustable slider changes to make each generative face unqiue. 

When training the faces I followed these rules:
	Eye type 1 was matched with blondes.
	Eye type 2 was matched with brunettes/black hair.
	Eye type 3 was everything else.
	Eye size matches how wide open their eyes are.
	I tried to keep they eye colour natural (except for those with brown eyes who matched with purple on my mask overlay).
	Girls always have sketchy/wiry outlines.
	Boys have less sketchy/wiry outlines.
	I tried to keep the cheek size matching how wide they were smiling.
