I fixed the brick wall function so that it's in a for loop to clean it up. 
I also added detail to the window sill when you zoom in once. I added stars that 'twinkle' when you zoom in 3 times into the window. I'm trying to figure out how I can distribute the stars randomly and so that the stars twinkle in different timing so that it looks more natural.
