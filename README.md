## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I developed the cross-hatching effect to fit in better with all of the images. I got rid of the vertical lines and made the stroke weight slightly bigger for the horizontal lines. I really like the effect this created because it adds a bit of motion to the images. I particularly like how this looks on image 3. Although I have not decided on the exact images I will be using for my final, I know that I want to have a farming theme because it is something I care about and want to express the beauty of it.

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
