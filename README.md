### Tree clock

I have changed my alarm so that the ellipse that fills the screen gets closer to the edge of the screen before the alarm is triggered and the background colour changes back to the original colour. When you start the alarm state the arcs change colour to signify that an alarm state has been triggered, which adds a bit of interactivity to my clock. 

I am happy with my clock and I like its asymettric look that is created with the arcs. I am happy with the simple colour palette that I have chosen which is inspired by trees and grass. 

If I had more time I would perhaps make my clock more complex, however I feel that the simple aesthetic matches my orignal inspiration of the way that tree shows time passing.
