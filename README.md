## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of books I have read. The masks for each photo highlight various objects.

I have started to experiment with the code adding in different effects, to see what looks best for my code. For this I have changed the background so there are lines, and  made the stroke f the stars thicker. I think next I will try adding to the mask a grey shade, to help with the theme more.
