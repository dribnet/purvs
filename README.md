### Sand Clock

This is my final work of the Sand Clock. This clock is inspired by the sand glass. For my idea, I want to combine the traditional sand glass and the modern digital clock together. Also, it would be made of by the digital-looking numbers but at the same time, keep the "trait" of sand glass that to show the time passing in a quiet and slow process.

Besides, I design the each unit of numbers in a hexgon shape. Although it cost me much time to code but it looks more digital and also more related to the sand glass.

For the alarm function, in my original idea, I planed to create the effect of sand falling from the top to the bottom as the background. However, when I was coding, I found that if I use this idea in making the background, the numbers of time when the alarm is off may be hard to read. After that, I moved this effect into alarm function. Now when the alarm is running, dots will fall down like sand. 

When I started to code the clock, I wanted it to be simple but designed, and now I think I already reach the goal. Nevertheless, the alarm part may be refined in the future. At the beginning of coding the alarm, I tried to use objects and array functions to make the falling sand move in more random and flexible ways but failed. So I changed my code into easier ways but the final result lost some fun.
