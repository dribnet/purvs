## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2


Today I started on the sketch file making each letter a different shape and colour and started working on a smaller triangle parameter to form the letter



Each of my letters is composed with two squares. The size and position of the first square is fixed, but the location and size of the second square is controlled by three parameters.

The parameters per letter:
  * `backgroundShapeType` : the type of shape
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `boxColour` : the colour of the first square
  * `triangleRotate` : roation of the smaller triangle
  * `triangleSize` : size of the smaller triangle
