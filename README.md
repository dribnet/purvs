## Morse Code Alphabets
With Tom's help, I managed to make the animations I want to make fore my code. I'm trying to think of a name for the font. 

20 parameters per letter, 4 for each ellipse of one alphabet:
	"ballposx"
    "ballposy"
    "ballsizew"
    "ballsizeh"
	"ball2posx"
    "ball2posy"
    "ball2sizew"
    "ball2sizeh"
    "ball3posx"
    "ball3posy"
    "ball3sizew"
    "ball3sizeh"
    "ball4posx"
    "ball4posy"
    "ball4sizew"
    "ball4sizeh"
    "ball5posx"
    "ball5posy"
    "ball5sizew"
    "ball5sizeh"
