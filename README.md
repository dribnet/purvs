## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I have made my exhibition words that I will keep for the final submission tomorrow. I have also made 2 new  parameters named: "rect2x" and "rect2y". The reason I made these we because I wasnt happy with a few of my letters and how they looked, namely T, X and Y. I tried making these letters look as good as possible with the last parameters but they still didnt look how I wanted them to. So I created these 2 new parameters in order to have a second rectangle shape in my letters. Using this new rectangle I made those three letters look a ton better than they did before. After adding a new parameter I also had to create it in the "Interaction.js" file so the ne wshape would smoothly transition around the screen. I am now doing some final touchups before submission, really there is not much left to do apart from update with the final readme and statement.

Also I named my font "Neoblock", I wanted to have the word Neon but couldnt fit all of the words in the exhibition so Neoblock it was.

I am now on 12 parameters:
sizex
sizey
offsetx
offsety
rect2x
rect2y
cirsize1
cirsize2
ciroffsetx
ciroffsety
cir2offsetx
cir2offsety
