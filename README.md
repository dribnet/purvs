## PS4 MDDN 342 2018


FOURTH:
The boat design didn't turn out how I would have liked it to, so I have gone with the same
concept but made a Koi fish pond instead. This design has allowed me to add randomness 
and animation to the design which is ultimately what I wanted. When zoomed in on the water 
you can see the particles moving and when zoomed in even further you can see the actual water
particles. 

THIRD: 

Layers have been added, in the mean time I am designing a boat sitting in water for the first
zoom, each layers in this example will display how the water molecules apear as zoom increases.
Animation will be coming to the water soon also.

SECOUND:

This iteration has been made through modifying the example fence 3. First I want
to design the top layer which is meant to represent a wave like motion through using 
randomness.

FIRST: 

This sketch has been developed from one of my iterations in PS3. I used shades of blue on 
a grey background for one of my wallpaper designs. It reminded me of a water molecule, this
sketch has been developed from that concept to create four layers which will you will be 
able to zoom into. 

Zoom One: Liquid motion 

Zoom Two: Stiffer closer/faster motion (boiling water)

Zoom Three: Wave motion 

Zoom Four: Static H O H
