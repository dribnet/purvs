## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So I think I will stick to these shapes since I like how the rounded shape of the ellipse works well with the edgy and sharp triangle shapes. All thats left is to play around with the mask I think. Will probably do some minor changes if I feel like something would make it looks better.

Added some vertices to make triangles since I couldn't be bothered trying to make the triangle function work. Played around with the ellipses, putting them into the background since I did not like the blocky shape the rect function was making.
