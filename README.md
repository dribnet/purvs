## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

there are 18 parameters as of now as the premise is, 3 parameters per shape, 2 shapes per face, 3 faces.

 //front-right face
 size1 = width and height
 size1cont = width and height of contour
 xpos1 = x position of face
 xpos1cont = x position of contour
 ypos1 = y position of face
 ypos1cont = y position of contour

//front-left face
 size2 = width and height
 size2cont = width and height of contour
 xpos2 = x position of face
 xpos2cont = x position of contour
 ypos2 = y position of face
 ypos2cont = y position of contour

// top face
 size3 = width and height
 size3cont = width and height of contour
 xpos3 = x position of face
 xpos3cont = x position of contour
 ypos3 = y position of face
 ypos3cont = y position of contour

Hopefully this link works but this is my illustrator file that I've used to explore my ideas for my font. I really want to lean into the 3d aspect, in my code at the moment I am working at converting my cube to a 3x3 version, from the original 2x2. This should give me a lot more working room for the more difficult letters. Alongside this I am working on the 3dness of a single face, at the moment I have just done the front right side, if you look at the b it shows a good idea of what this is. I plan on doing this to the other faces as well. I'm also thinking that with this new effect I shouldnt have a reason to change the position of the main face, so I can remove 6 variables which puts me at a much more comfortable 12 parameters.
