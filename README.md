## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

In my final version of this project, I changed my concept from David Adey art style to Pop art style.

Actually, I am struggled with the map function for the grid. Also, I couldn’t use the WEBGL to continue to develop my previous idea. 

For this idea, I got my inspiration from Thuy Nguyen about layers in a box of almond chocolate. The first layer is the box and when you zoom in it will slowly reveal the layers of ingredient in the box such as the chocolate and almond filling. 

I have four zoom in layers.
0: Chocolate box
1: Open the box, you can see the chocolate
2: Chocolate shaking in the box
3: Chocolate with almond filling
4: Only almond

Technical issues
To be honest, the code is quite hard to understand. I spent about one week to play with it and could’t figure out how the map of grid work.

Because I don’t want to do the iterative wallpaper in the first zoom layer then I took long time to put each of the points into the canvas which I want it to be.

That’s the completed process in my coding time.

The package reference is from MUJI Almond chocolate.
