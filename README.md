My letters are composed of a red rectangle that is fixed in size and place, with only one other rectangle changing size and position. The background is a very dark, obtrusive colour with the intention of bringing all attention to the letters.

  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
