## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I tested out the smart mask on the last image of the purple orchid. It turned out pretty good but there still isn't that great for what i actually want. I think that it would be best ot use the oiginal mask instead of this as I like the one I made better. This turned out to look okay it covered what I want but just too much and it I just want the flowers.
