### String Theory

I did some research on clocks and time to try gain a better idea of what to do for my clock, for me time is a variable and can be assigned as anything meaning it can be manipulated to be different.

I focused on the part where time is manipulated or can be manipulated, I looked into the idea of time as a 4th dimension and string theory but was more interested in the 4th dimension. So I first looked at how a 3D objects parameters could be manipulated by time so the x axis(seconds), depth(hours), height(minutes) but it ended up looking ugly so I ditched that idea and focused a bit more on the 4th dimension.
