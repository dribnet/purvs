Each of my letters is composed of a constant circle, and two triangles that change position, colour and rotation. This simplicity allows for few parameters to change between letters.

The three parameters per letter:

rotation1 : rotation of the first triangle

rotation2 : rotation of the second triangle

offsetx1 : x offset of the first triangle relative to the circle

offsety1 : y offset of the first triangle relative to the circle

offsetx2 : x offset of the second triangle relative to the circle

offsety2 : y offset of the second triangle relative to the circle

colour1 : colour of first triangle

colour2 : colour of second triangle
