## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Upon asking for some design feedback in the slack I realised that in order for me to properly emulate the precedents I had set I needed to elongate the ellipses in the sky
and also to increase the render counter to make the shapes overlap more to look more similar
to the impressionistic style. After some experimentation I have found that 35 is a good number where it doesn't show the background through too strongly but also doesn't overlap too much to where you lose the effect of being able to see the individual shapes.

I also experimented with increasing the opacity of the sky and earth sections to see if it would help to increase the brushstroke effect. I'm not very happy with the result of this and in future iterations I will experiment further with the opacity of those areas, however I am going to keep the sea section at full opacity as I really like the way that it looks.
