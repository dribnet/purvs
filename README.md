Episode 01

upon finally deciding on what my parametric aphabet would look like, i have finally settled on an inspiration
mainly my parametric alphabet will be bsaed of the cipher code. Think of it like a morse code variation, but is
much more complex in terms of shape. THE FOLLOWIN LETTERS SO FAR ARE

A, B , C , D 

i will upload a full cipher guideline code for a reference.

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
