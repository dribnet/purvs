## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Initial #2

Here I am starting to experiment with applying a grid and diferent shapes to my tiles rather then just using random. So far I have followed along with the changes Tom made by adding for loops into my code and I am now trialing different shapes within these loops to work on getting a effect I like. I am now going to add the mask in and use the else function to seperate the 'life' and 'death' parts of my images.
