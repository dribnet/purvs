Style 1:

I wanted my design to be an abstract one, but still readable. Each of my letters is composed with two lines and a triangle. There are 4 parameters controlling each of the two lines. My idea is that each character will be the same triangular shape and only the added negative space will change. If I develop this further, I might consider having the triangle flip as an extra parameter. To make the charcter shape more clear, I think it would look good to have a different colour for the secondary triangle created by the lines. So for B, I would colour the middle section and for C I would colour the right second.

The 8 parameters per letter:
    *	line1(2) length: length of line
    *	line1(2) tilt: angle in degrees of line
    *	line1(2) x: x axis position of line
    *	line1(2) y: y axis position of line
