## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images 1 and 3 above are photos of the street of Penang, Malaysia and image 2 is a photo of a boat canal tour in Bangkok Thailand. These three images were from my Southeast Asia trip in 2018 and I thought this would be a great theme for this last project . The masks for each photo highlight the streets and water objects.
