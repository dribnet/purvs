## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

I have finished all the letters/numbers/default! I will still most likely tweak things, such as the 2 in the future but I am also happy with how it sits at this stage. Next I plan to experiment with colour choices and then move on to fine tuning the interpolisation/interaction. Everything in this commit conforms to the below parameters so in total my system requires 12 parameters.

New parameters:

  * `sizeB1x` : size of x length of two of the smaller boxes
  * `sizeB1y` : size of y length of two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2x' : size of x length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2y' : size of y length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * `posB1x` : x position of first small square
  * `posB1y` : y position of first small square
  * 'posB2x' : x position of the second small square
  * 'posB2y' : y position of the second small square
  * `posB3x` : x position of the third small square
  * `posB3y` : y position of the third small square
  * 'posB4x' : x position of the fourth small square
  * 'posB4y' : y position of the fourth small square
