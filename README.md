## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 12 parameters.

The trangles also use a fill with a slight opacty giving it a layered look.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

Added code to determine difference in height, allowing each letter to be centered in relation to each other.

Also slightly altered some parameters for particular letters to allow for more space between letters.
