### Clock Update


This is my pretty much finished clock, I had to switch around my alarm variables so that it would fill the whole way to the bottom of the hour position as I had made a mistake in my code before. I also changed up the colors a bit as the lines on the white background didnt really stand out too much. I am overall very happy with the output.
