## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

At first I was trying to use 3D cube to complete my design but I realised that it limits my design outlook a lot. Since I could not customise the faces of the cube if I use 3D cube funciton, I have decided to draw my own cube with the vertex function instead. In this way I can customise my cube's three faces' colour to create the isometric illusion alphabet that I intend to achieve.

For my next step I will try finding a way to reduce my use of parametres since I have exceeded the 12 parametres limit at the moment.

The parameters per letter:
  * `x1` : x offset of the first cube 
  * `y1` : y offset of the first cube 

  * `x2` : x offset of the second cube relative to the first one
  * `y2` : y offset of the second cube relative to the first one

  * `x3` : x offset of the third cube
  * `y3` : y offset of the third cube 

  * `x4` : x offset of the fourth cube
  * `y4` : y offset of the fourth cube 

  * `x5` : x offset of the fifth cube
  * `y5` : y offset of the fifth cube 

  * `x6` : x offset of the sixth cube
  * `y6` : y offset of the sixth cube 

  * `x7` : x offset of the seventh cube
  * `y7` : y offset of the seventh cube 

  * `x8` : x offset of the eighth cube
  * `y8` : y offset of the eighth cube 



=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
