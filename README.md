## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

idea: a space inspired design where a planet and a moon eclipse the sun, which creates the outline of the letter

possible names:
spacecase
eclipsed

I put all my suns shapes into a embedded for loop, and stored the colour values in an array. I also decreased the amount of layers it has so that the code doesn't run slow. I thought it running slow was just an issue with my laptop, but then it was still running slow on the macs so I knew I needed to fix that
