## PS2 MDDN 342 2017


In this introduction to Problem Set 2 I linked my existing refined portraits style from Problem Set 1. I had to adjust the scale modifier so that the faces would sit within the determined drawing space. 

Moving forward I think I will opt to use one of my other drawing styles from Problem Set 1. I would rather use a front facing design as opposed to the side-on view of the current style. 

My goals for this project are to produce designs that are recognisably derivative from the photograph they come from. I felt that I would not be able to get this effect using the current stylised design, instead I think it would be better to use a more humanoid design.
