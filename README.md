## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I started my sketch on sketch.js. The idea is a wheel that shows the letters through a series of arcs and straight lines. I didn't get very far as I am super confused on how to add the parameters. Bex mentioned something about true/false statements last class but i didnt know how to do that. hopefully I can work it out by next class. I like my idea so far though.
