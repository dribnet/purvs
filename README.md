I managed to get my colour choice and background going the way I want, but figuring out how to fit everything into these parametres without getting bugs is proving annoying.

I like the idea of a very bold, serif style font so i'll be experimenting with hard lines and minimalist shapes. Hopefully there wil be a decent update within the next few hours.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : Literally the width and height
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
