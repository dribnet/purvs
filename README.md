## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I've been slowly iterating through my concepts, and have found one that I will continue forward with. The idea is to use the base code that our tutor provided, and build the larger shapes discussed in my original concept from this. I will then be adding further detail with smaller shapes, allowing the user to zoom in and explore. Animation will be the final addition to the composition, however, the type of animation has yet to be confirmed.
