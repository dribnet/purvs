## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


I am designing a 'font' to be used in a graphic design way, it is made from triangles and is not 100% totally readable as the mainstream and typical forms of the letter. I do not want the letters to be instantly recognisable but I do want them to have some resemblance and readability that they could be used in abstract graphic design. I want my letters to made from the most minimal amount of parameters possible. Doing this through triangles. I wanted to use a limited almost monochromatic colour scheme. I have set myself the challenge of trying to be good at using triangles since I have not really used them in my other designs in creative coding. 

Cleaning up my code and making sure there are not any small differences. I wanted to make sure my letters use similar shaped elements to create a cohesiveness so I edited some of the positions of my parameters to make it look much cleaner. I only did this to some letters that I found super noticeable and also the ones I am happy with the design of so far but will continue to do this as I refine designs of letters further. 

Here are my parameters for each letter so far
   "triX1": first x point of first triangle
   "triY1": first y point of first triangle
   "triX2": second x point of first triangle
   "triY2": second y point of first triangle
   "triX3": third x point of first triangle
   "triY3": third y point of first triangle
   "2triX1": first x point of second triangle
   "2triY1": first y point of second triangle
   "2triX2": second x point of second triangle
   "2triY2": second y point of second triangle
   "2triX3": third x point of second triangle
   "2triY3": third y point of second triangle
