## AQUA FONT
Tuesday 12th June
I have completed my numbers and now im going back over and touching up and letters that dont suit the style. I have also updated the animation in interpolate_letter to make it fit my font better.

I have finished the alphabet, now I need to do numbers 0-9 below. 
Complications : Throughout the alphabet I wanted to try and create each letter from just a line, an ellipse and an arc but its proving to be more complicated then I thought. Some letters like 'S' and 'M' have to be quite abstracted than the rest. Where as 'V','W','X','Z' have to be simplified because of their shape. I am currently experimenting with different ways to make letters look a lot nicer while keeping the theme of the 'aqua font'.

I am current experimenting with my own shapes to create something abstract/different. In the process I have made in making this alphabet I have configured the arc to create an interesting shape the represents each letter, along side the line which also helps seperate each letter individually.

I have experimented with different styles and finally decided on how im going to approach my lettering in my alphabet. I have named my style 'Aqua Font' after its blue style along with how the letters are shaped.

The parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the line relative to the origin
  * `offsety` : y offset of the line relative to the origin
  * `arcX` : x position of the arc
  * `arcY` : y position of the arc
  * `lineX` : y position of the line
  * `lineY` : y position of the arc
  * `arcW` : width of the arc
  * `arcH` : height of the arc
  * `arcS` : start point of the arc
  * `lineOX` : x position of origin point
  * `lineOY` : y position of origin point
