## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos I have taken that are processed through an alogrithm that converts "natural" areas into an irregular square pattern, and unnatural areas into a very regular line pattern. The first image in the set is the exact opposite to the rule as I thought the colours of the unnatural section looked nicer with the flat colouring.
