## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Experimenting with arcs with lines

Using the combination of arcs and lines creates a nice paint like texture of my images. I think using arcs helped make the image look more whole compared to my last experiment. I still need to refine the arc code to further support the smaller details of the leaves, especially for the second and third image. So far the mask hasn't been very apparent, and I'm hoping in the future changing the colour values will help with that. I think I may need to work on the masks for the last two images though. Maybe making the masks for the last two images simpler will work out better.
