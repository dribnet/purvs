All done~! Letters are represented by these pixel/lego squares 8 in total for each letter. I made sure to stick to the traditional letter shapes to retain the legibility of the words.

Due to the limited number of squares, I was unable to keep my letters a consistent shape and size, for instance, my V,O, and H. My letters are a mix of upper and lower case because of the same reason.

The 16 parameters per letter:
  * `p1offsetX` : x offset of first rectangle.
  * `p1offsetY` : y offset of first rectangle.
  ... p8offsetY..
