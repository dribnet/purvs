-FOLDED-

My final font plays off origami, with each letter consisting of two triangles that overlap, each letter consists of 12 parameters.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

The transform for each function is done in such a way that it gives the illusion of refolding the paper to form a new letter.
