my letters was inspired by paper cutting and geometric shapes, and its consist of two triangles that overlapped a rectangle, also the triangles' color same as background color

I changed the background color from blue to green, also I finished the alphabets and the number, each of the style is based on geometry.

I finished the interaction part, and it look smooth for animation and interaction.

For my final submision, I changed the color of background and font, I think the color would be interesting and attractive.

The twelve parameters per letter:

gx : x offset of the first triangle relative to the first point
gy : y offset of the first triangle relative to the first point

1x : 1x offset of the first triangle relative to the second point

1y : 1y offset of the first triangle relative to the second point

2x : 2x offset of the first triangle relative to the third point

2y : 2y offset of the first triangle relative to the third point

3x : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the first point

3y : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the first point

4x : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the second point

4y : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the second point

5x : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the third point

5y : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the third point
