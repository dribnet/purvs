### Cloud Hop Clock

Basic Hand in (Preview Shows a rough outline made in paint):

The clock will be a pixel art, 16 or 32 bit style. The numbers of the clock will be printed on top of small 
clouds which also act as a resting place for a small cute creature. This creature hops on the clouds depending
on what hour of the day it is, slowly rotating around the clock over time. While the creature is on the cloud
it may perform little animations while waiting.

To set an alarm you can click on the creature (or maybe the center where the sun or moon icon is),
and will be given the option to select a time. When the alarm goes off the creature will perform a
little shouting animation on the cloud with a sound effect, maybe pull out an instrument as well.

The background will also change depending on what time of day it it, e.g. the image will be of a sky 
during the day, which will switch to a starry night sky when the clock say hits 7pm. Clouds and Stars
in the backgrounds should also be animated, clouds moving across the screen, stars blinking.

Extras:
Things that I may add to the clock if I have the time to do them.

- Add in Dawn & Dusk backgrounds and icons into the cycle
- More animations for the character (Say falling sleeping after a short amount of time)
- Connect to a weather API to be able to Display current weather in some area of the screen. Most likely the 
  Center where the sun and moon are located.	
	-Extra Overboard: The clouds with numbers will react depending on the weather, for example they may 
             		  all start raining
