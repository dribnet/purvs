## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

I'm going to be using my sky from my landscape as inspiration for this project.

At the highest level of the sketch, you will only see bright spheres, like stars. As you zoom in, you can see that some of them are planets, with simple rings around them. When you zoom in again, you can see details on the planets, and that the rings are made up of mulitple rings, along with some smaller spheres being comets. When you zoom in again, you see many little stars in the background, some in clusters.

Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
