## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I added a third mask to all my images for the billboard. I think this works better but I may have made the ey for the second image too big. 

The ellipses drawing on the billboard mask are also clashing with the eye mask and encroaching on the eye and making it appear smaller.

Next I want to experiment with more intricate and interesting ways to fill the masks and have these relate more to the mask that they are actually filling.
