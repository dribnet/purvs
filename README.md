I found 24 images of my own to use in Facemap mode. I created landmarks for these, and then tested them using Facemap. Most of them were correct, and the femininity/masculinity recognition was pretty on point (most of the photos are headshots of my football team, and these were recognised as being women, so were assigned a lighter pink colour for the cheeks).

I then went through most of the images in the Neighbors mode, and used the Interpolate function to make sure that the faces are being recognised correctly and assigned the right facial components.

From there I tried out both TrainQuiz and ValidQuiz, to check that I was able to correctly guess approximately 8/10 of the images. I feel I was mostly successful, however there were often two images that seemed to output a similar face that I would get confused between.
