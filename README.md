## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
The photos of this project were taken in the graduation ceremony, graduation is a very important thing for the student especially for the international student, We leave hometown thousand miles away for university education.
The idea of making this custom pixel was to keep the image simple and clean and focus on the people, I removed the background of the picture instead of use coding to fill some circle with random colour.
For the smartmask, I used smartmask in my second image. smartmask works well with my picture, but it still lose some detail.
