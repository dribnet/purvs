## Powers of 10 PRINT

This program is based on my sketch from part 3.

It creates a randomly generated map using noise .

The first and second zoom levels give you a zoomed out version of the map, allowing you to see it from a
general perspective. The 3rd zoom level provides more detail and starts showing key highlights from the map.
This allows you to zoom in further to investigate these features. The final zoom level gives you much more detail,
by showing all the small shapes and features of the landscape.

It currently has 2 biomes: Tiaga and forest. I intend to add some more, such as lake, mountains, and possibly a
desert. I would like to focus on adding some different shapes, and getting biomes to be more distinct, to allow
further exploration.
