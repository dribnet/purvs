## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

For the current thumbnail and preview I mainly was just messing around with the code, just to try and see what I could make with it, this isn't the proper idea that I have in mind. 

My current idea is to do Neon Sign or a digitcal clock looking idea. The plan is to have an single square like object which is made up of multiple lines and shapes that, like a neon sign or digital clock, will light up different lines and segments to show different letters. I could also then add in a feature which allows the user to change the colour of the letter sign, this can be extended upon so that the user can have multiple letters showing like how one of the other example had, and for lines that are used by both characters, the colours of both letters could mix to show that both are in use. Will only do this if I have time.

You can also see a very bad sketch of what the main shape will look like, as well as how each letter would be represented using the shapes different lines, in the idea.png. By default the lines will be black and then each letter would light up in a specific colour. 

Current Slider Ideas (Will update over time):
- Current Letter Colour
- Current Brightness
- Flicker timer (Lights could flicker to give the neon sign effect, this slider could be a timer for the length between flicker animations).

Extras:
- Undo Last Letter:
- Amount of letters on screen
