### 20/04/22 - MAKING MORE LETTERS

Today, I continued to make more of my letters and numbers, completing all of them apart from the letters N, W, X and the default, which are a bit harder to figure out. It was quite easy to create the new letters as all of them are made within a similar grid system so it was just a matter of repositioning the squares and rectangles. I have been sketching them as I go so I know where to move each of my squares. The image below shows these sketches, as well as some of my other ideas I had from my last push that I didn't upload then and some notes on variables.

The letters I have left are a bit wider and/or might need more squares than I have to complete so I will have to think a bit more on how to do them. You can see this issue with the M as I would have liked to have more space between the side lines and the center square. I could make the middle square thinner to add some white space but that could upset the balance of the letter compared to all the others.

The 15 parameters per letter:
  * `numLineSquares` : The number of squares to be drawn in the array
  * `lineSquaresX`: The x position of the square array
  * `lineSquaresY`: The y position of the square array
  * `rect1X`: The x position of the yellow rectangle
  * `rect1Y`: The y position of the yellow rectangle
  * `rect1Width`: The width of the yellow rectangle
  * `rect1Height`: The height of the yellow rectangle
  * `rect2X`: The x position of the red rectangle
  * `rect2Y`: The y position of the red rectangle
  * `rect2Width`: The width of the red rectangle
  * `rect2Height`: The height of the red rectangle
  * `square1X`: The x position of one of the first white squares
  * `square1Y`: The y position of the first white square
  * `square2X`: The x position of the second white square
  * `square2Y`: The y position of the second white square

My next steps are to finish the last few letters and adjust some of the others I already have. I will get some feedback to see how I could develop my design further. I also still need to decrease the number of parameters I have to hopefully get it down from 15 to 12.
