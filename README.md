Created Alphabet setup

After getting some more done, I have set up all that needs to be done to finish my alphabet. i just need to enter the parameters for each letter. I have attempted to create an alphabet with the least amount of parameters possible, making it much easier to code. The interpolation animation is also very simple and satisfying as it is purely the movement of 3 rectangles.

The three parameters I plan to have per letter:
  * `top` : The size of the top rect on the Y axis
  * `mid` : The X position of the vertival line
  * `bot` : The size of the bottom rect on the Y axis
