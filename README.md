## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

04/05/20

I have started to play around with the project. I have kept the same variables but have checked to see if I can add in another letter and how to control the different parameters. I think next I should look into how I will design my alphabet and I am confindent with the coding aspect of it at this point in time

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
