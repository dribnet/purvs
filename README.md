## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have edited the spider function to create a strand of lines rather than a a flower of them. This gives
more of the scratchy scribbly look i was going for. I have also edited my passes to firstly draw the skin
then the background and then the body last. 

I'm going to continue to edit the spider function and try a few different things then work on making the 
shattered abstract looking background.
