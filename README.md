## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

For my first idea I wanted to do a paintbrush stroke. I had the idea after playing around with some sketches and one of them ended up looking vaguely like a stroke. I wanted to do each stroke a different colour using either random numbers or a colour picker kind of thing. The colour palette would be derived from the pop art era, with the bold, bright, and complimentary colours.

I have had a bit of trouble with github so far, I though I had already forked this project, but it turns out I hadn't, so I have had to re-do a bunch of my progress. Although annoying, it i not too much of a worry, because I had just been experimenting with shapes and colours anyway.

I hope to get the full shape and most of the letters done before the we return to classes, because it will make life a whole lot easier.
