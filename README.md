## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

This is the my final version of my font 'CYCLICAL'.

Made up of arcs and lines my font follows a circular theme with each letter and number being contained within the boundaries of a circle. With all letters following this guidline it makes the transitions between letters very smooth since there arent any parts moving location, only rotating.

 As someone whos design philosophy values functionality as much as athestics one of my main goals was to have it be reasonably legible.That lead to me trying to come up with simplistic designs with a patteren that could be applied to every letter and have them all look like they fit in.

After lots of brain storming, the circular design stood out because, by using only a few lines in different orientations, you could clearly understand each letter and it gave the minimalist look I wanted, making words look more like custom logos than a font.

I chose to keep the animation and transitions relativly simple. Since each letter was so similer to eachother, the clean and quick switch between the letters gives of an almost mechanical feel which i think fits the sharp design.

In the end im very happy with my font and was fortunate to have a strong design direction from the begining. I think my design set the goals I wanted to achive with it being resonably easy to read and understand while also being paired with a graphic design type look made of clean lines and bold values. The design allowed for straight forward easy parameterisation and wasnt overly complex. I have a total of 9 parameters all playing a large part in the fonts visuals. Lastly I gave it its conveniently 8 lettered name "CYCLICAL" after the cyclical and rotating nature of my font.

The 9 parameters per letter:
* `line1R` : rotation of the first line around the centre of the letter
* `line2R` : rotation of the second line around the centre of the letter
* `line3R` : rotation of the third line around the centre of the letter
* `line4R` : rotation of the fourth line around the centre of the letter
* `arc1Start` : start of the first arc
* `arc1End` : end of the first arc
* `arc2Start` : start of the second arc
* `arc2End` : end of the second arc
* `lineLength` : the line length being between the radius and 0
