This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

I enjoy some randomness in my work, so I've gone and created a slider to control just that. The first sketchy face is reminiscent of my style of drawing

Second face was just me fiddling around with alpha sliders

third face is gonna also be sketchy
