## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today I was playing around with the layers of the mask to make the flowers stand out more. I have made it blue so its very obvious to see the mask however, I think I overall need to make light grey mask bigger if I want to make the flowers stand out more.

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
