Concept:
This alphabet is made out of two transparent arcs, which create the approximate form of english letters where they overlap. The goal is to make a full, somewhat readable alphabet from only two arcs. The bluish arc sits to the left and top, and the red to the right and bottom, in that order of priority. As it stands, this totals 10 parameters per letter.
