This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 
I have made quite a bit of progress on the normal doll face.
A couple of the sliders do slightly different things when other sliders are in different places. There are still a few things I want to revisit if I get time, I may create a different mouth for the normal doll, and extend the doll hair to bunches.

For my second face I want to play with the idea of abstraction and art. What if the flowers blooming on her cheecks were actual flowers, and what if there were real stars in her eyes?


I don't know yet what I am going to do for the third face.
