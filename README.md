## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme: Pasifika Identity in Aotearoa New Zealand. 

Changed 3rd image and went back to some older code. Still using triangles in the background.

Thinking about adding colour, still experimenting with the code and trying to choose my final 3rd image.

Also might go back and re-mask to mask out the faces.
