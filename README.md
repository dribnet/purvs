## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I've translated the letterforms into the alphabet. I realised that there is a lot of unneccessary variables in my code that I could simplify and make the process quicker. That will be the next step, along with working on the rest of the alphabet. I also would like to clearly outline my letterform system as I want it to be precise to communicate that elegant and sophisticated feel.
