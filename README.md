## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of books I have read. The masks for each photo highlight various objects. 

For this project my theme is books. For me i love reading as it is my way to escape the nusy lives we read. The books i have included are different boks from some of my favourtie series. 
When taking the photos of the books i tryed to arrange them in differnt layouts, then with the mask was highligting differnt areas of books.
