## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Images shown are a turtle-tendril visualisation of points spreading through the input image, sampling colour from underneath and splitting based on the rate of colour change in the area.
A map of these rates of colour change is made first before using this processed data for the tendril generation.

My intention was to represent holistic connectivity between elements of nature and human-made structures.


I chose to generate my 'mask' on the fly rather than creating it ahead of time by hand or through smartmask because my concept is heavily dependant on the pixel data of the image itself, so keeping things closer to the source seemed sensible to me.

Unfortunately I ran out of time to properly complete this. It would have been nice to give this concept a few more iterations, particularly around the line drawing functions, which currently lack contrast between different points.
A less complicated concept would probably have been a better idea to pursue given reduced working capacity.
