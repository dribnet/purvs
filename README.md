### Outrageous clock

My clock will consist of various circular/spherical colour gradients that will act as an analog time format. Each shape corresponds to seconds, minutes and hours to evoke familiar timetelling for the user.
The inspiration of my clock is fundamentally a person's ability to tell time through music. With the thought of music in mind, the clockwork-like instrumental of Drake's "Hotline Bling" gave me an ideal feel and aesthetic (via James Turrell's abstract visual sets).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
