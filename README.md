## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I added a second mask to make an outline around the first mask. In the mask I made hexagons with the same pattern as the circles but a little bigger. This is because previously the there was no connection between the circles and the hexagons.

I also changed the hexagons colouring so instead of having it get continuously lighter,  it gets lighter then goes back to the original colour and then gets lighter again.
