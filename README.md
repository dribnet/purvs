I fixed up letter G for more variation and to make look a tad more realistic. The only problem for G is that it's hard to incorporate lines as it's mainly a circular letter, such as C, O and Q. I also changed up E and created my special character.

My special character is meant to be a "%" character with a twist on it. My aim for this was to make it sort of reversed, so that instead of two circles, there was just one. Also I had two lines instead of one and spaced this out so it wasn't dead set in the middle. Connecting the two shapes also reconstructs the character in an opposite way, as the normal "%" symbol is not connected.

I also fixed up my Z as I noticed it wasn't aligned properly, as well as changing my 5's line to look more connected. I fixed up 2 as well to make the bigger circle connect to the lines, following my consistent method with the other numbers.

I tidied up my code a bit! I fixed up the variables so they look better and just spaced things out better.

I settled on a name for my alphabet, and decided to go for "Pinkness" as my font itself is pink. I also updated the "swapWords" and chose words that related to pink and sort of girly words. I firstly came up with the names, then chose which one looked best with my font. At first I chose "Blushing" as the name, but then I settled on "Pinkness" as I liked how "pinkness" appeared since it showed off my favourite letters.
