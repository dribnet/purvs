## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I realised that the white and light grey masks were overlapping in some parts and originally i wanted to get rid of this but it actually gives a super cool effect of the orange and the stripes overlapping.

I also experimented with a few different colour combinations on the second output image by swapping some colours around and adjusting the light grey mask.
