## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

To start off with i wanted the just play around with the masking and using my own image, I decided to use previous work because i didnt have a camera on hand and it was just a test. 

I went with a coding project from last year where we made a poster where i had used gohan from dragon ball z.

For some reason after initially putting the new mask and input in it would come up with an error so i left it for a couple of days and then redownloaded my ps4 files and it seemed to work however i noticed that it wasnt predictable where the ellipses and rects where gonna end up so now im gonna look into why and possibly changing that.
