I have laid down the foundation of my interpolations so that now when interacted with my alphabet can animate between letters. Unfortunately I was unable to follow through with the original plan. At first I was going to make it so that my letters blinked into each other meaning that at 50 percent nothing was visible but a line. When trying to accomplish this I realised it was impossible with the way I set out my letters. I am already at 20 parameters so the base of my shape is not parameterised meaning it cant the animated. This ruins my original plan because I cant make the red base blink at all.

Because of this I had to make my letters animate in a different way. At the moment I have each cutout moving across the base from one position to the next. This works but I Will need to tidy it up because in some letters the triangles are hidden in places that don't make sense to the user during the animation. to fix this I will move them under/over the squares on these letters so that they don't just come flying from off screen and the animations are cleaner.
