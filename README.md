06/04	|| My letterforms work by having each parameter correspond with one point of each triangle. 2 triangles = 12 parameters per letterform. The red triangle uses the parameters point1A, point2A, point3A, point1B, point2B, point3B. The black triangle uses the parameters point1C, point2C, point3C, point1D, point2D, point3D.
|| I have rearranged my parameters in letters.js so the interaction.html transition between letters has the triangles rotating correctly. It's been tedious and trial-and-error based but I think I'm done with that part (hopefully(?).
|| I have to consider how I'm using negative space and whether am applying it consistently, and having the numbers use the black triangle as the dominant triangle in the letterform to distiinguish them from the main alphabet.
||The exhibition.html is a cool place to hang out and try thinking of words to challenge my font to see how well it works. Previously, letters such as "E", "M", "N" etc, were pretty difficult to read, but I've since modified the designs of these letters. Unfortunately I'm still using a lowercase "E" in my uppercase font, but that's as far as I've gotton with my two triangle approach.
