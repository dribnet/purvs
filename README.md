 I use two sectors as a module to build the letters and digits.One sector has a stroke and another doesn't. I think it is better for the alphabet to transform.Because the sectors can be changeful from o degree to 360 degrees while the strokes can highlight the significant part. For the color palette, I use red, yellow, green to compose the alphabets so that they look like red heart watermelon and yellow heart watermelon.The name of the fonts is "MELONLTR". I make efforts to keep the fonts express clearly and easy to recognize. 





 The ten parameters per letter:
 size1 : radius of the first sector
 size : radius of the second sector
 offsetx1 : x offset of the first sector 
 offsety2 : y offset of the first sector 
 offsetx : x offset of the second sector 
 offsety : y offset of the second sector 
 aecS : start of the first sector
 aecE : end of the first sector
 aecS2 : start of the second sector
 aecE2 : end of the second sector
