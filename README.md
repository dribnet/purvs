GRAND GAIA RUNE FOUNDARY

So some minor adjustments have been made. The holes in letters such as P, Q and R have been removed and styled similar to the starting A and B. Other things include removing anything shapes that were somewhat TOO squarish and adjusted them to be more angular such as lowering the frontal angle of the R down a bit and lifting the bottom U corners up a bit. Otherwise, everything else remains the same...Oh yeah and I also did the interpolation stuff.

GRAND GAIA RUNE FOUNDARY

So I managed to get the leters D, E, F, G, H, K, O and X done...H was a pain to think of but it managed to happen. I've also created the default shapes for the letters. This ended up with 16 parameters as I had to add an additional two today.

"This is most...difficult...perhaps this wasn't as easy as I thought...The earthborn are certainly an interesting race"
