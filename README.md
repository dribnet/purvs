## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Right now I am going with the theme 'friendship'.

These pictures are of me and my friends in different places. These places are places where I socialise are make new or develop my friendships. 

The three areas are skating, pool, and the last image that will be put in will be university.

So I've made a collage of photos that relate to each topic and put photos that I think that are important and have a meaning behind them.

Right now I've rendered one image with very small circle square size because I wanted the images to be visible as possible and the background will be coded with patterns. Hopefully.

My next goal is to add patterns that relate to the topic. For example, skating maybe wheels or skateboard decks, pool just pool balls, and the last image for uni will probably a mixture of emoji expressions, angry, sad, and happy etc.


Very precious moments and memories ye.
