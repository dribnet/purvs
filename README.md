## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I softened the boldness of my previous so that they were still similar, but more pleasant to look at. I also adjusted my if statements in the draw_letters file, adjusting the percent from 85 down to 80, so that the transition could be smooth, and so that the rotating, lock motion had a longer length of time, as I felt that having a higher percent made the letters lock too fast, and became a little jarring to watch. I also took the time to clean up my code, as I feel that I am very close to being finished. I also wanted to expand on the idea of fantasy space technology and exploration. For this theme, I became inspired by Star Wars, especially the droids, as I felt that the rotating and locking motions of my letters reminded me of parts of a machine/robot. I also looked at Star Wars droid anatomy charts, to find words for my exhibition that were relevant to my theme.

I decided to name my font Astromec (pronounced as astro-mech), as a reference to fantasy space exploration, adventure and technology. Based on this theme, I chose eight words that are associated with astromechanics, fantastical and real-life droids/robot technology and space exploration:

"ASTROMEC" - The name of my font.
"RECHARGE" - A necessary function for droids to operate.
"COUPLING" - A device needed to connect a droid to other technology.
"INFRARED" - This is a reference to receptors that some droids possess to sense infrared light.
"DROID123" - This is a reference to the fantastical robots on Star Wars, as well as a chance to exhibit my numbers.
"VOYAGER?" - This is a reference to the NASA space probes that are currently exploring interstellar space.
"ODYSSEY?" - This is a robotic spacecraft launched by NASA, also used for space exploration, more specifically Mars.
"EXPLORER" - A reference to both real and fantastical people who have explored space.
