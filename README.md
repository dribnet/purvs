## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment

I've decided to put all parameters in each letter even if it only had 2 lines, but not 3. This is because I noticed that when it would transition to a letter with 1 (or 2) line strokes for eg: the letter H, to a letter with 3 strokes like F, the third stroke would just pop out of nowhere. I fixed this by just adding all 3 lines in every letter, so when it transitions to a letter with more or less line strokes than itself, it'll smoothly transition.

Next, I will just update my final purview.json file, and update my final README text about my progress and state my parameters.
