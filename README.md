Each of my letters is made up of 2 triangles. I am currently having issues with the rotation and translation of the second triangle. I may look into a different way of setting it up so I avoid using the rotate feature. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `rotate' : rotation of triangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second triangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second triangle relative to the first one
