## Final

The beginning task was to create sketches which represented recognisable faces. I chose Harry Potter and Pikachu. Leading on from this I knew I wanted to create simple cartoon faces. 

I was then inspired by the fire character, Calcifer from Howl's Moving Castle. I chose to develop this fire rather than the other two sketches in part 2 because I felt it evoked more emotion and is simple yet still has an interesting shape. 

I explored different colour flames randomly placed in a grid. I wanted the orange one more eye catching with a brighter colour, bigger scale and different mouth shape to express more shock. The blue is the most calm with its mouth closed. While the purple is slightly shocked and out of it/spaced out.

I refined the layout in Part 4 by making orange the most common colour. 87% of the time the fire is orange, while 10% of the time it is blue and the most rare colour is purple (3%). 

After contemplation I went with a random variety of orange colours as it creates more variability. I made sure there was not much variety so it does not look to chaotic. 

I experimented with a different layout where the colours are separated from each other and more common appearing colours (e.g.orange) are closer to the bottom.

For my final layout I decided to go with a grid layout with some jitter and varying tilt values. This is so that the blue and purple flames will appear randomly making it more of a surprise.

I also made the orange colours more closer in shade making the more yellow and red colours less common.
