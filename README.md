## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

First week
I started trying some ideas. I would like to be able to combine the traditional alphabet and the Braille alphabet. I also started to see what a combination of colors can be. This time try something monochromatic on each letter using a different color.

Second week
In my second week I was researching about alphabets and how to implement my idea. My main problem is the limitation of parameters that we have, in this work I would like my letters to be as close as possible to the real letters and not to be so abstract.

Holidays

on my vacation I broke some git and I can't make changes to the page. anyway I kept working on my alphabet but I did not save the changes and I only have a copy on my computer that I will keep when I can fix it.

I decided to make the letters as similar as possible to the original alphabet and I decided to use capital letters, in my opinion it is more aesthetic to maintain a unified height size with all the letters

''''today I was able to solve the problem I had to upload my files to git so I will upload all the documents that I was saving throughout these days''''

this alphabet represents one of my examples. I decided to improve the previous code by changing the color and adding stars to the letters. tries to look as close to real letters as possible and has a Russian constructivism design style.

Third week

I still couldn't fix the git problem but I'm still working on my alphabet. try trying something more geometric and playing with the colors. I still haven't decided on a color palette but I'm doing different tests to see which one is my favorite.

I am not very satisfied with how to do number 2. Aesthetically it is my least favorite but for now it will remain this way.

I decided to add two types of lines to my letters, horizontal and vertical. I think it is taking a quite retro shape as it has a fairly wide thickness and the vertical lines that stand out I think they go with the style.

Something that I must improve is the animation of the triangle, it does not generate any change and it looks a bit static so I would like to change that. the problem is that it does not incorporate it in all the letters so every time I use it it looks a bit weird.

<!-- Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one -->
