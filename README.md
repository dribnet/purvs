## hello

The theme of my images is Heaven. The three images represent what Heaven is to me. One feels at home, full of love, and full of hope in Heaven.

The images are arranged in a way that is designed to appear surreal, conveying the fact that Heaven is an abstract concept and beyond thorough comprehension. The first image takes street scenes and pictures of family to create a sense of familiarity and comfort. The second image is arranged with happy people hugging to convey the joy of love. The third image is more abstract as it tries to communicate a sense of hope; the handshake represents an agreement, the sign represents direction, and the other images represent a sense of calmness, freedom and peace.

Rectangles of random size within the mask. Rectangles of uniform size wih random noFill ellipses half a shade lighter on top. Struggling to find an interesting way to render.
