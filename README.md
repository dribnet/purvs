Greeble City

I have adapted some of my code from ps3 into this new sketch. I am getting similar looking results but shown as a larger scale city with districts. I am happy with this however will need to do some more refinement in order to create more visual interest. I also need to find a way to generate the districts without them being redrawn when zoomed.
