### Snake Clock

So for my clock I based it off the classic mobile snake game. I figured that individual square would be too hard to read, so instead I changed it just long rectangles. I think that the idea of the bar ticking is across is pretty interesting. Maybe make the ticks different colours so it would be more visually interesting.
