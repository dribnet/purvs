## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This commit was mainly about updating the text element to be consistent across all 3 images.
I added the text into my mask layer, and then used a separate function with an if statement to separate the masked areas into text and image. I tried to use filter(INVERT) and a push/pop to make the text be the invert colour of the pixels it was on top of, but for some reason it just kept inverting the entire image. I then switched to just using a blue fill (the over of the waste ep has this blue colour theme), and drawing some squares. However, there are a few issues. There aren't enough squares being drawn, so the text isn't complete (also, there aren't enough lines being drawn in the rest of the image too). Also, the long lines being drawn in the non-masked bit are drawing over top of the text squares. I've reversed the if statement, and it still does this. I really don't know how to stop them from drawing over top.
Other notes- I actually like how the horizontal lines work with the vertical stripes in image 2, image 1 being colour seems to not fit the aesthetic theme, and I'm still really concerned about the render count.
