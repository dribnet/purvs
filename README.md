## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Update 2: I have uploaded this git commit to get some help with stroke Weight varaibles

Today, I have played around more with my design, I really want to challenge myself using code variables that I don't normally use, I've started off with arch and triangle as I don't have a clear direction on what I want to do with my design, I think I want to play around with morse code or braile and the idea that variations of patterns create different letters

The parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `archH` : h offset of the arch height
  *	`archW` : w offset of the arch width
