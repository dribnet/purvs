## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

##Grid Experiment

I tried out the grid techniques we learnt from last lecture and shown above is my own interpretation of the code. This is subject to change because as of now, this grid technique only looks best with the third image. I still have the other two to alter.

Also instead of adding the owl visuals on my image, to relate it back to my theme of technology, I decided to create emoji functions of the like/thumbs up button on Facebook and heart like button on Instagram. This is because I feel that these two social media apps are the two most popular apps that are causing us to be disconnected from the presence of one another.

As stated, this current layout/graphics only suits the third photo for now but I will be working towards the other two and improving all three images before hand in.
