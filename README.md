## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
With Phoebe's help I fixed up the heart code and it's now working on my photos! I accidentally named a part of my heart function draw, which meant Atom was only reading that draw function so was writing off all the important code related to my image that was also called a draw function. I really like how the hearts look, and I've put the blue colour mask into all three photos as well. I'm thinking of making my theme something along the lines of "nature meets digital", as you have the very autumnal natural colours and the hearts, but then the bright digital blue over the mask. I'm also hoping to create another mask as I think the rectangular shapes I had over the trees in the last commit looked really cool, although I'm not 100% sure how to do this so will need to do some more experimentation.
