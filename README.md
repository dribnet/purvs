### Final Windows 95 Clock

I mostly made aesthetic changes today. I added more comments to improve the readability of my code, I created a new function that draws a pixelated hourglass on the left side of the window, I improved the borders around the windows, X, loading bars and buttons, and improved the way in which the active and inactive buttons appear to appear closer to the Windows 95 look. I also made a slight change to how the alarm appears when the windows pop up. If I had more time I would perhaps look into improving the font used (the ideal font is MS Sans Serif with no anti-aliasing - something I donâ€™t think it would be possible to achieve with P5.js without considerable effort), having the hourglass rotating slowly, and having the buttons react to being clicked by becoming indented briefly.
