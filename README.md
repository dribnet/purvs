I was very confused on what kind of approach to use for the landscape design, and looking at other classmates on Purview did not help much as there were very large varying approaches used.

It didn't make much sense to me to have both the wallpaper and landscape designs comepletely different, So i started trying to incorperate my wallpaper pattern into the grid layout, and use perlin noise to create a landscape with different regions.
