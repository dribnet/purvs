## Concept
My concept is to have two sinus curves wich can be manipulated in the height, width, length, offset and the rotationangle. I mainly chose to work with sinus curves as I wanted to have an technical challange while designing the letters. 
## Letters
Each letter is composed out of two sinus curves wich are always connected to each other.
## Numbers
I tried that the numbers are drawn incomplet but that you still could recognize them. 

## Parameters
### The parameters for the first curve:
- ** heightY ** defines the height of the curve
- ** widthX ** defines the width of the curve
- ** length ** defines the length of the sinus curve in one direction
- ** Blength ** defines the length of the sinus curve in to the other direction
- ** offsetX ** is there to move the curve along the X-Axis
- ** offsetY ** is there to move the curve along the Y-Axis
- ** rotation_angle ** rotates the curve 

### Parameters for the second curve wich have the same meanings as the one from the first curve.
- ** heightY1 ** defines the height of the second curve
- ** widthX1 ** defines the width of the second curve
- ** length1 ** defines the length of the second sinus curve in one direction
- ** Blength ** defines the length of the second sinus curve in to the other direction
- ** offsetX1 ** is there to move the second curve along the X-Axis
- ** offsetY1 ** offstetY is there to move the second curve along the Y-Axis
- ** rotation_angle1 ** rotates the second curve
