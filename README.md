I've finished up the numbers so now all I need to do is fix the interaction. I don't really know what's wrong with it so I'll have to wait till next class. I'm sure I can tidy up some of the letters but I will do that if I have the time to after integrating the interaction section.


The eight parameters per letter:
	* 'posx1' : X starting point of bezier
	* 'posy1' : Y starting point of bezier
	* 'posx2' : Second X point of bezier
	* 'posy2' : Second Y point of bezier
	* 'posx3' : Third X point of bezier
	* 'posy3' : Third Y point of bezier
	* 'posx4' : Last X point of bezier
	* 'posy4' : Last Y point of bezier
