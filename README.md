(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The first circle draws on a baseline but has a variable size. The location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The four parameters per letter:
  * `size1` : radius of the main circle
  * `size2` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
