## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Project updates for Karen O'Brien

I think I've nearly finished with my photo series, I'm very happy with how my masks are looking and I think that my message is conveyed very clearly. Over the next couple days I'm going to see if there's any refinements I could make to my code or masks.

As New Zealand recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, I want to use this project to remind Wellington of how quickly diseases can spread and the importance of social distancing. As the 'hidden monster among us', dangerous disease is very easily spread through lack of distancing and hygiene, as the world has very quickly learned over the past few months. In my image series I will be using the technique of thermal imaging to show the hidden symptoms of disease amongst society and it's contrast with the rest of the un-contaminated public. By using the warmest colours of bright red, orange and yellow to represent a person infected with Covid-19, this will contrast with the blue/green shades of the background and the slightly warmer shades of green and yellow for the general public. Any surface touched by the person infected will also be warmer and have orange/ yellow colours.
