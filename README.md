## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I have been playing around with different images I can use for my final, I think I will continue using my flower photos as they display a lot of colour variety. I will need to consider the flowers having different angles as well as making the code make the images look like they are flowers


The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
