## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

3 / 4 / 22:

My final sketch for the alphabet design:

The preview and thumbnail are updated with this sketch today. I try to show a happy face in the form of letters.
I only use the circles for the whole letter design and used 16 parameters(4 X/Y sizes and 4 X/Y Locations). But all of the parameters are not used for all forms and depend on what I need for that specific letter, might be less or more.
This is for now. I'll come back with the rest of my work one by one.
