## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of my loved ones and pets. I have edited them so that they are pixilated with a cross-hatch kind of look. I masked out the background and recreated the cross-hatch but with a fixed fill colour which means the image focuses on the subject of the image and gives it a pop art look.

I created the "cross hatch" using two different sized ellipses and rects. This was mostly just an experiment but I do like the effect, I'll definitely be playing around with them more though- editing the colours, experimenting with lines and custom shapes etc.
