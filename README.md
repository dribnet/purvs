## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

As of right now I do not know what kind of image I will go for. I believe I may go for something like landscapes and city skylines or even portraits.

UPDATE #1
Currently I have a image of Scarlett Johansson that I edited years ago, an image of my MDDN241 Porject 2 model, and Vincent Van Gogh's famous starry night.

UPDATE #2
Currently I have 3 images from my year one DSDN144 photographics project 2 which looked at light. My thought process for this project was to show big name companies products in a type of evil light. I am trying to figure out how I can shape the code to best represent this idea.

UPDATE #3
Currently I am exploring different shapes with my design and now i want to try and play with the mask features adding more different shapes on different parts of the image.

UPDATE #4
I have added 3 shades to my masks one white, one grey, and one black. I have then changed the code to see this extra shade. I have found that with the addition of this new shade and shape to these images I can personally see in artwork_1 The Starship Enterprise, in artwork_2 The Millennium Falcon and in artwork_3 a simple thruster propeling heat as it takes off.

UPDATE #5
I have recreated the mask of my second pictureto look more like a bottle to help display the idea and theme better. I believe i will go either find or take more pictures that display the bottle better for my other artworks.
I have also set my circles up on my picture to gradually grow as it renders to give of a fizz type effect.
