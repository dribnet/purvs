## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've experimented with a few techniques to do with shapes. I wanted to focus on lines as I think this will give a more artistic look, however, I might want to change the mask for my jellyfish to make it look more visible. I'm still yet unsure on what shape to use for the jellyfish as I don't want to just use lines, but I think perhaps the ellipses will look cool if they were smaller. I want to try experimenting with maybe making the masks look a bit smoother so that it blends in more for the image, such as using a brush type.
