## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Fixed interpolation, I just did the maps wrong thinking I needed to set the lower and upper numbers of the map to what the parameters were.

Added numbers, read by the amount of 'peaks' on the line, 0 no peak, 9 = 5 + 4 peaks.

I made a new H but it looks like an X, I can't figure out how I would make a capital H


Letters I don't like atm (maybe it needs a third wave):
H - idk whats worse, lower case H or upper case H that looks like an X
I - needs its top, another wave
Q - respect its ugliness
U,V - very similar

Todo:
Colour scheme
Perhaps colour based on how many peaks, length
