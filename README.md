## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I removed some of the polygons inside the main polygon, and made them white instead of black. I also made the masked parts made with dots.
I made a mask for the rose based on it's petals. I'm thinking of adding another mask and have a blend between the dots and hexagons.
