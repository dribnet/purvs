### Turrell Inspired Clock

I've added the visual hours component as a placeholder before I finalise the colours and various shapes into the next update.

Will add a static circle that changes colour with the background which will change by the hour.

These will both be changing into different colour gradients.

-ran into some problems with the debug, looking to receive some help from my peers and tutors.
