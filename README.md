This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

Homer can move his eyes, mouth and change the number of hairs on his head
Bart can dilate his eyes, change his hair and change the number of teeth he has
Flanders can wiggle his mustash, change the width of his mustash and change the colour of his glasses lenses
