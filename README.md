I finished setting up my alphabet as well as the numbers. I will now be working on polishing the interactions and readbility and finding the right colour palette.

Each of my letters is composed of a circle, an arc and a rectangle. The size and position of each shape varies, the arc start and end and the rotation of the rectangle too.

This alphabet takes inspiration from [**Wassily Kandinsky**](https://www.wassilykandinsky.net), a Russian painter and pioneer of abstract art (1866-1944).

There are twelve parameters per letter:
  * `size` : height of the rectangle
  * `recOffsetx` : x offset of the rectangle
  * `recOffsety` : y offset of the rectangle
  * `rectAngle` : angle of rotation of the rectangle

  * `size1` : radius of the ellipse
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the ellipse
  * `offsety` : y offset of the ellipse

  * `size2` : radius of the arc
  * `arcOffsetx` : x offset of the arc
  * `arcOffsety` : y offset of the arc
  * `angleStart` : angle start for the arc
  * `angleEnd` : angle end for the arc
