## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I decided to change my idea after realising how the coordinate systmem works in this problem set. I wanted the Gustav Klimt inspired patterns to look more organic but I think it'll be more suitable to carry on with my graphic style that I used in p3. My new idea is to show a blank brick wall in the beginning, zoom in and the window will pop up, the next level of detail will be objects (ie. pot plant) on the window sill. For the animation element, I'm thinking of having ambient clouds floating in the window when it's in detail shot.

In this commit, I've begun to work out how the coordinate system works and implemented my brick wall pattern into it. I need to clean up the function into a for loop so that it creates draws the brick wall with way less lines of code but I wanted to do it manually to make sure everything was working fine!
