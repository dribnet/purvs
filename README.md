From the beginning, I was interested in using arcs and rectangles to explore possible letter forms. To ensure I was keeping under the maximum number of parameters allowed, my goal was to achieve a letter design that was as minimal as possible while still being readable. At this point, I wanted to focus on literal forms rather than abstract, so that I could begin finding multiple ways to design my letters.
For this design, each letter consists of fourteen parameters. Each letter consists of two arcs, and one rectangle. While the positions of the shapes vary according to the letter, the width, height and point differences between start and end of the arcs remain the same. The width and height of the rectangle can also be adjusted. For this design, I wanted to create a geometric alphabet that was fun and sweet to look at. I almost considered having the parameters of the rectangle set to 0 for the c, but I ended up deciding against it, as I wanted every shape to be visible. I am very interested to experiment with shape opacity, as this could add an interesting texture to my forms.   

The fourteen parameters per letter:
- "rectX" : x position of the rectangle
- "rectY" : y location of the rectangle
- "rectW" : width of the rectangle
- "rectH" : height of the rectangle
- "arcW" : width of both arcs
- "arcH" : height of both arcs
- "arcX" : x position of arc 1
- "arcY" : y position of arc 1
- "arcS" : starting point of arc 1
- "arcE" : ending point of arc 1
- "arcX2" : x position of arc 2
- "arcY2" : y position of arc 2
- "arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
- "arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
