## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

For the past couple of days, I have been working on the interpolation of the letters. In my last read me, I talked about where I wanted to go with the interpolation and how I was having a difficult time achieving this. After struggling with how to achieve what I wanted using the framework given to us, I have finally got the interpolation to a place where I am happy with it.

The main issue that I faced was focused around the X and Y co-ordinates for each 'pixel' that make up the letters. Each letter in my alphabet is made up of 20 main variables, there are up to 10 pixels that make each letter and every pixel needs an X value and a Y value to determine it's position on the canvas. The interpolation function  requires every single variable that makes up each letter to function, that meant that I *had* to include every X and Y value when transitioning between letters, that is what lead to that awkward 'shuffling' effect that I talked about in my previous README document.

My main design focus for this project was to create a font that embodied the concept of a font you would find on a very old school computer or some kind of terminal, that is why it was so important for me to change the interpolation, because the "shuffling" just didn't look very computer-y at all. The solution that I eventually found was to take the upper value of the map functions that made up the interpolation and change them from their normal value of 100 and change it to something ridiculously high *(I chose 5000 for the specific time that it made the transition last)*. Phoebe told me to make sure I specifically talk about this change in my code and in my README to make it as obvious as possible that this is an intentional design choice and not just a bunch of broken map functions.

Once I had the 'shuffling' effect disabled, I created two letter variables: lightPixelClr and darkPixelClr. These variables made it possible for me to incorporate a colour change into my interpolation and finally achieve that effect that I wanted. The oldObj is set to the dark pixel colour so when a new letter is typed, it has a kind of *'screen burn'* effect and I am incredibly happy with it. I am now at the point where I enjoy opening exhibition.js and just typing out a bunch of random words and letters, I think this means that I am pretty close to finishing my project and just in time for the hand in on Thursday.
