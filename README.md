## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Going through photos to find inspiration for theme when I came across a photo I had from a trip I took with friends after graduation, and it is one of my favourite photos because of the energy it gives off. I think I want to base my theme around friendships and adventures and bliss, obvisouly I need to refine this idea down more but it was fun to experiment with that photo and I like how painterly it looks, might be something I stick with.
