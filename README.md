## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I tred again with a combination of rectangles and ellipses, and the
results feel like real photos. When you look at it from a distance,
you don't see any traces of modification, and there is no pixel
effect. This is an attempt to realistically present the original
picture.
