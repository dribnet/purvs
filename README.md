## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

With this commit I played with the smart mask a bit to see how it would work on my images. As I had thought it did not go well, due to my images being rather abstract already I believe it was hard for the smart mask to pick up on what was in the image in the first place. The smartmask only picked up objects in the second and third image but none in the first image which is why it has not been changed.
This being the case i decided not to use the smart mask for two reasons, one, I want to have custom masks that I have created myself and two these smartmasks are really dirty in the way of bad edges and wonky lines everwhere.

I believe that the smart mask could be good on less abstract images but for my project that is not the case.
