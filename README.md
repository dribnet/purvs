## Powers of 10 PRINT

Since I had the foundation of the math behind the pattern working I decided to begin creating the graphics for the computer desk scene.

I overlayed a numbered grid over my illustrator design to help me to determine the coordinate space of the p5 sketch.

With the aesthetic of this project I wanted to push my understanding of the art style that was achievable within p5. I opted to implement a smooth vector art style to challenge myself to create a design that challenged the traditional design produced using code.

Once I had my top level scene established I looked into mapping my dot pattern into the infinte space. This proved quite challenging, but with Tom's help I was able to reproduce the design in the movable canvas.

Currently the switch between the zones is quite jarring so I will look to implement a smoother method for this.
