PART 2 FINAL

This is my completed part 2 for problem set 4. Wrapping my head around the code has been a real struggle, so I'm going for a simple grid map aesthetic. This is different from what I originally planned, but I think the final output will be more effective. 

I've based this off the 10 print example code and I think this is the most appropriate due to the structure of a mapped landscape. Currently there are 3 zoomable zones - Sky/clouds, map view, and land view. My goal is to add new features for every point of zoom.
