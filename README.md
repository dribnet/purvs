## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I still choose three of my ball joint dolls' image but remove the color of the background because I only want highlight the doll. I want my doll's face more clear than the body and also the doll's eyes more clear than the face, but when I tried to load different masks it still nothing change, I am not sure it is my mask problem or my code problem.
