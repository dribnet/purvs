## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

After the zoom 5 I have created some text saying follow me, so it sounds like something is calling you from the monitor.
I will still make the user to follow along the middle point which has an empty ellipse at the moment but I will keep adding things in here just to make things more interesting. 

Next step would be adding details to the middle point, might make a ghost's back or something like that.
