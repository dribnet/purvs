Finished Alphabet.

In my initial planning stages, the challenge of having the least amount of parameters possible took my interest. I figured that in order to have so few parameters, that I would have to have a consistent shape that took the form of all letters, and have small modifications to this shape be my parameters.

I decided to research fonts where all the letter forms were similar. I found that rounded letter forms were all very similar. I narrowed it down to 4 types.

The roundeds - This was letters like abcdeopqg that heavily included a circular form in the center of the letter. Since this was the group with the most, I decided to have a circle at the center of my shape.

The straights - This was letters like TFILXVKNM which consist of only straight lines. Because of these letters, i created the lines around the outside of my shape as to cater to both these shapes and the circular ones with sticks.

The hangers - There was overlap in this category, but this was letters like gyuj which hang below the line. For these shapes, I included an arc at the bottom of the shape.

I felt that the best way to alter this shape without using too many parameters was to hide the shape in different ways to only reveal parts which matched the letter forms. I experimented with two parameters, but it was difficult to make the shapes look different. So I decided on three.

The three parameters I plan to have per letter:
  * `top` : The size of the top rect on the Y axis
  * `mid` : The X position of the vertival line
  * `bot` : The size of the bottom rect on the Y axis

The colours I chose were to make the circle bold, and to hide the box covers, yet still have the viewer able to see them. Some of the letters use the negative space that the boxes create and so they need to be visible.

Potential improvements would be creating a slightly more complex shape to get the letterforms more true to form, yet this is minor and I am very happy with what I have created.

There unfortunately was not much of an itterative process that I underwent. Going into this project, I knew what my shape was going to resemble and because it took alot of planning, the first time was the only time due to time constraints.
