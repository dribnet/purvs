## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

I have been playing with sketch.js and making another ellipse to make my letters resemble more of the letters. I want each letter to consist of 3 ellipses the squeeze and strech to create the letters. However with letters like C that are more simple I might use the ellipse to create negative space or random shapes to make the characters more funky. Updated preview and thumbnail image too.
