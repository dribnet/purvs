## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Iteration 4 - Working on the 1st image - I decided to make a orange background rather than something similar to the other images. Reason - want the audience to know that this image shows my pototype making. Even though the image is of a prototpye, audience will see how creative I was being able to make this. Orange is just temporary. Kinda reminds me of a online green screen meme..:D
