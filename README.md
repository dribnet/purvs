MODIFIED VERSION:

To modify the letters,I asked my classmates and roomates to read the words for testing the intelligibility of my font. Then i decided to change the letters that hard to recognize. I redesigned the "G","I","J",K",S","T" and "Z". And also, I adjusted the "c", "D", "U" and "X". I make effort to make my font understandable and express clear concept.At the same time, each of them should different from each other. 


 The ten parameters I use:
 size1 and size2 to control size of the sectors.
 posx,posy,pos2x,pos2y contorl the position of the shapes.
 aecE,arcE,arcS2,arcE2 control the angle of the sectors.
