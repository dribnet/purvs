## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I’ve added noise to the x and y values so that they will produce a sort of wavy effect, which gives some dynamic to the image.

Rather than ellipses I have decided to add curves that form a sort of tear drop shape. I was intending to create a faux-3D effect but my values didn’t really work out that way, and I felt I didn’t like the direction my images where taking. 

The effect is interesting but Im more interested in interpreting the image rather than adding an effect to it.
