## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I redid the colour scheme to a more classic monochromatic style. Instead of dark text I took a negative approach with the letters standng out on a darker background. I also layered a lighter inner arc on a smaller stroke. I think this adds a little more intrest while not ruining its minimalist and clean design, to which i think gives of an almost graphic design kinda look which Im quite fond of. 

I also added a few custom words including the fronts name 'CYCLICAL'

The 9 parameters per letter:
* `line1R` : rotation of the first line around the centre of the letter
* `line2R` : rotation of the second line around the centre of the letter
* `line3R` : rotation of the third line around the centre of the letter
* `line4R` : rotation of the fourth line around the centre of the letter
* `arc1Start` : start of the first arc
* `arc1End` : end of the first arc
* `arc2Start` : start of the second arc
* `arc2End` : end of the second arc
* `lineLength` : the line length being between the radius and 0
