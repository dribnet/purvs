In this iteration, I keep the simple geometric idea but I change the rectangle to the 
square, in that case each of the shapa will reduce 1 parameter. 
For the letters, I used the different size squal compose together to shape the simplified abstract letters.

Now there three 
square for each letter, and 9 parameters in total.

let pos2x = 0+letterData["x1"];
  let pos2y = 0+letterData["y1"];
  let size1 = letterData["s1"];
  //point2
  let pos3x = letterData["x2"];
  let pos3y = 50+letterData["y2"];
  let size2 = letterData["s2"];
  //point3
  let pos4x = letterData["x3"];
  let pos4y = letterData["y3"];
  let size3 = letterData["s3"];

x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3 control the position;
s1,s2,s3 control the size.
