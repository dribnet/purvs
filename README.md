## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I didn't like how in the preview and thumbnail, the letters looked green, so changed the fill to be more blue.

Made a different design for '2', which still looks a bit abstract, but more closely resembles a '2'.

I considered getting the '9' to be a modified 'six', because the two numbers are usually reverses of each other, but I prefer the previous '9'.




I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
