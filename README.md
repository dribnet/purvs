## Powers of 10 PRINT

My idea takes my wallpaper from ps3 and uses it to create a paramatised map. I chose to use my wallpaer as it is created completely from straght lines. The use of straight lines overlaping each other at an angle tricks the eye into thinking it is a curved edge it is looking at. By being able to zoom in on the shape I hope the viewer wil be able to see the compostion of the shape better and notice that it indeed is a made up of staright lines. I may experiement with a more zoomed out scene, or try to create a pixelated background which when zoomed in apon reveals another layer to the puzzle.

A daydream of what might be hidden within the C64 10print maze
using p5.js and leaflet.
