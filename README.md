## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters is composed with four circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the other circles is controlled by the parameters. There are 2 bigger circles and one smaller.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the big circle
  * `size` : radius of the Small circle

  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

  * `offset2x` : x offset of the third circle relative to the first one
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the third circle relative to the first one

  * `offset3x` : x offset of the fourth circle relative to the first one
  * `offset4y` : y offset of the fourth circle relative to the first one
