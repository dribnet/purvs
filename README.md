## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - AGING

I've discussed my theme to Phoebe a few days ago, relating whether it has to be personal or just purely entertainment photos/theme. At this point, I've scratched the neo-tokyo theme (as much as I like the photos), and just opted with more of a personal theme of aging. I will convey these through photos of my sister and my mum, as they are people in my life who I truly love the most, and will be there for me no matter what (not saying that I don't love my brother or dad, but besides the point, they are just family members I am really close to and can open up to). I will show this by having my photos vertical instead of horizontal, so more of a portrait feel. I am wanting to make these photos "old", as it would relate to theme of aging. Black and white, with a vignette, and white "scratch marks" all over the pictures can help me show this.
