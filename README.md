EDITOR

Today I'm going to work on putting in the parameters on the sliders in the editor and getting them to work in the arrangement as well. So far I'm getting used to how the code works and I have made one of the sliders correspond to the height of every face as well as random variation in the arrangement faces. I still need to decide whether I will end up using multiple face 'types' with small variations or just use one face which can have a lot of variations.
