(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

For my alphabet I want to use mainly circles with a variation of filled and stroked, i saw an example where the letters were formed by a sort of boucing ball simulation
and was thinking it could be cool to go along that pathway. 

For this basic idea i just used 4 ellipses 2 filled 2 stroked and had 6 parameters for the positions of 3 of the ellipses.
