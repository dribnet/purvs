## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

STARTING OFF

I was having some trouble with displaying my rendered image, It would come up just have a page saying "Submittited Work Loading..." Since u used atom last year I never updated it so I gave that a try and then once I opened the local server it was finally working. I grabbed the photos of my laptop that I had and used made some mask highlighting the animals. The photos use where animals first experience to something new. Also, the thumbnail and preview didn't download so I had to put them in manually.

Output 1 - My rabbit Levi first time experiencing snow, he loved making snowballs by digging.

Output 2 - My sister's puppy Skye has my old teddy, it's still going strong!

Output 3 - My rabbit Harveys first time on the grass outside.

Processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
