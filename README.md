## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I've completed the first row in the alphabet. I also fixed the boundaries of the letterforms after realising they were messed up in the previous iteration. Every letterform posed a challenge in itself. I found myself referring back to previous letterforms to start a new one off. I have also developeded rules/constraints for my letterform system to keep it co-hesive. The major one being that the *CIRCLE* is the largest element in each form. I have enjoyed the challenges that it has posed so far in the letterforms and I am interested to see if it will still work on the remaining forms. My aim is to still create that sophisticated and elegant feel.
