## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

I am experimenting with using lines and points, however, I think I might continue to stick with the shapes as I am finding it gives the images more detail and works better with the colours in the photos.
