 today i finally figured out how github works! took me a while to figure it out but i'm all on top of it now (hopefully).

I replace the defualt images of the clock sketch with my own. i decided to make my clock graffiti themed, with cans(clock hands) spraying paint as they move. The colours with change as the hours do.

I finally figured out how to push origin. It involved me having to regenerate my token and get a new access key.

I also recreated a maeda clock which was number 4. It consisted of creating a piece of text to mock the time in white and having that as the centre piece. I copyied that, coloured it blue and ordered it so it was behind the white piece. Afterwards, I simply just had to move it 5 spaces to the right and five spaces up, and then rinse and repeat while changing the colours

today i created my sketch in code. While it does not look like much, It is a mere skeleton and will provide me with a guidline of where to go next. It might completely change, who knows. My next step will be to either create my spray cans in code or have them as an image, and figure out the code for a colour changing option. I will also have to figure out how to get the "hands" to rotate and decide how to get them to slowly expand with each minute / hour

I've put a lot of code in today. Iv'e tried to find a colour changing code that interacts with time, but it doesnt seem to work. I've tried to also Implement two images using that code from the first year course on the ,music visualizer. But it doesn't work, can't figure out why. Hopefully i'll figure it out by the rest of the week
