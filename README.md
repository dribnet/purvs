This is the whole alphabet. I did'nt want to go for an abstract design and instead a very simpele and readable design. I struggle a bit with the number 8, so that is probably the only abstract design i have in my alphabet. I made my default a straight vertical line so i had to create my alphabet so they all include 1 vertical line that had to stay straight. It would've been nicer to have them all either in lower case or upper case but it was too difficult and it would've made my design look a lot more abstract and mor challenging if i stuck with one case type.
