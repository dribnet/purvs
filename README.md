This readme is for part 4.

For the distribution, I have focused parameters. These are:-

-The amount of polygons in the face. These have equal % chance for each different number. The positions of these are static.

-The amount of polygons in the background. These also have an equal % chance for doing each iteration. 

-The amount of features in the face. These have an equal amount for each different iteration of number of them however each feature has a focusedRandom for its translation and rotation on the face. I have controlled these so they are not extremely morphed and look weird so to keep the structure and similarity but enough to have variation.

-Each different colour has a focusedRandom on it's Alpha value to be able to blend colours. I have picked some colours which are strong(not see-through much) and some which are almost transparent.

 For this iteration in my project, I changed my colour palette to one that I think is more earthy and easy on the eyes as this art style is very rigid and I want to contrast that with this choice.
