### Flaming Clock

--------------------------------------------------

I had the year wrong in my heading. Oops!
So here I'm starting my clock implementation, reusing some of the values I wrote in for the Conway Clock.

I'm also abandoning the TypeScript thing for now. Even though it was a lot of effort to get going in the first place, it's not a good fit for the format of this class.
