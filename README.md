Each of my letters is comprised of smaller rectangles that are positioned within the outer rectangle
(not too sure if the way I structured the parameters is fine or not...)

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : size of the outer rect
  * `innerRect` : list of rectangles with offsets based on the outer rect
