### Final

This is my final clock, not what I intended to have but couldn't figure out how to make an arc out of vectors so I resorted to this design.

 For me time is this abstract concept/entity so I wanted a abstract clock design.
 A clock is used as a way of measuring time and we use that measurement in photography for exposure, So for my clock it was about combining photography and a clock so starting the sketch the clock over a time period of 24 hours will slowly create a long exposure image. 

 For long exposure images if you have an subject move slowly through it you will see the subject morph over time, this is a representation of the 4th dimension. Seeing a subject change over time.

 My clock takes an input of a video to represent a camera lens, the start of the sketch is like the camera capture button being pressed and at certain time intervals will take a slice of the video input and place it on the sketch creating a distorted/abstract image where the placement of the slices will always be the same. If the input was a webcam capture the slices would always be different.

 The clock is hard to decipher in terms of telling what time it is because I wanted my clock to be abstract, it's easier to tell the time when the clock has been exposed for 24 hours. But the current time is represented by a flashing slice.

 The video input is a video of me recording a clock and rotating around the numbers I thought of it as a literal representation of my clock.
