## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are of random pedestrians around the Wellington CBD and outskirts. I've decided to base my theme around "Urban Isolation" - the idea that despite us being constantly surrounded by people at all times in cities, many are made to feel alone nonethless. It is as if the constant influx of people depersonalizes us and make us feel that much less in touch with everybody around us.

I added more complexity to the code in form of rounded squares. These are each represented by the "Innertangle" and "Outertangle" function. Red and blue are contrast to each other.

Furthermore I've added a grey mask to my first artwork, although I'm yet to make use of it.

At this point it is a very subtle effect. Further iterations are needed.
