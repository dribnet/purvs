This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

For this project, I'm wanting to try 3 certain styles and identify key face parameters from those styles.

The first style is Art Noveau. In this style, curve designs were popular among artist resulting in extravagant patterns.
The parameters I have decided for this are hair, which I can edit the length and variation of, the faces sharpness and nose curve.


The second style I want to try is Pointilism under Post-impressionism. In this style, alot of the the design is around definition. 

The parameters I want to try edit for this style are the face definition, meaning how solid the face outline is, the contrast between face details, in terms of brightness, and detail for the eyes.

The third style is a NonRepresentational style.

The parameters I want to edit is the amount of colours used in the face, the amount of polygons used in the designs in the face, which will be a discrete amount, and the amount of features as this style usually doesn't stick to regular limits in that aspect.'
