PART 4: DISTRIBUTION

This README explains my changes for part 4 of assignment 1. 

I generated a distribution based on 3 facial features which all correspond with the emotion of the eyes. 

1) There is a bias toward having wide eyes over small eyes with an emphasis on having very large eyes most of the time.

2) A higher brow height is favoured over a low brow

3) There is a slight bias to look to the right of the screen rather than left or center.
