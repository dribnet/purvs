I have kept Mike from my first inistial concept and played around with styls and shapes of the character. 


There is a 15% chance that a low polly Mike will be created instead of the elipse version. there is a 10% chance for a dark skin tone 10% for a medium and 80% for the reguler. 

On the normal mike there is also a 20% chance that the one horn is missing and a 10% chance the other horn is missing with bouth horns being in the rest of the time.
