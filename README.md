## Alphabet in Stars.

For the final submission, I made a few changes to make my design more approches to my topic which is starmap. Firstly,  when I research some starmap image in internet, I found every constellation has
its own ruler. Therefore, I pretend each of the alphabet is a constellation and give a ruler for them. Based on the theme, the main color I used is blue (light blue or dark blue). The animation I used making the 
alphabet looks more interesting when interacting. 






Parameter explanation:
I used 16 vertexs in total. 

 let pos1x = posx+letterData["x"];
  let pos1y = posy+letterData["y"];
  let pos2x = posx+letterData["x1"];
  let pos2y = posy+letterData["y1"];
  let pos3x = posx+letterData["x2"];
  let pos3y = posy+letterData["y2"];
  let pos4x = posx+letterData["x3"];
  let pos4y = posy+letterData["y3"];
  let pos5x = posx+letterData["x4"];
  let pos5y = posy+letterData["y4"];
  let pos6x = posx+letterData["x5"];
  let pos6y = posy+letterData["y5"];
  let pos7x = posx+letterData["x6"];
  let pos7y = posy+letterData["y6"];
  let pos8x = posx+letterData["x7"];
  let pos8y = posy+letterData["y7"];
