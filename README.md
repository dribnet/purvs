### Mechanical Era

NEED TO DO THIS BY NEXT CLASS...
(Just checking I can repoen the file and upload again.)

I will base my clock off the standard clock face. However, I will be replacing the traditional numbers and hands with a display representing rows of diodes. To show the time, the small lights will act as the hand by illuminating accordingly. The clock will function as tho it were a mechanical clock in the inside but with modern era design on the outside.
