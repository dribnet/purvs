The concept for my alphabet is to base it on the [Aurebesh Alphabet](https://omniglot.com/images/writing/aurekbesh.gif) from the Star Wars universe.

| 16/05/2020 | Continued refinement of character shapes. I am limiting the x-axis to Â±15 in order to keep my shapes within the bounds. I also have key design elements, such as forms that have vertical or horizontal lines in them will include a horizontal or vertical straight line in them too, proportionally (aside from 0). Also most angular shapes will have the two circles offset to represent this.											  |
| 16/05/2020 | Finished base character shapes, will revise and clean them up as required (as some don't fit within the bounds, and others have tails due to rounding errors on my part). Fixed width = 0 && height = 0 leaving a dot in the centre and instead that now makes it invisible.							  |
| 13/05/2020 | Managed to get letterA to work however, my variables are starting to balloon trying to get the other shapes, and is becoming a bit of a headache to produce. I'm having to add variables for each letter and I imagine as I do the whole alphabet I would discover even more will be needed. With this in mind I will likely be changing my design to work with the arcs/triangles idea I also had hand-sketched. <br/> Switched design to arc and I'm pretty happy with how it is looking. 10 variables for now and looks fairly neat. The colours are somewhat placeholder for now; considering this a prototype scheme and will investigate something more fitting for the final design. <br/> As of this afternoon I have now ported my sketch.js into the appropriate areas, and I've slightly modified the background colour to better suit the scheme. The editor works and has provided me with my default character (for now at least). <br/> This evening I was able to start creating the rest of the alphabet, whilst also fixing the interpolation.				  |
| 11/05/2020 | Initial work on sketch letters. Deciding on horizontal lines as the design I want to pursue, I have modified the draw variables to work for that.																		 |
| 10/05/2020 | Current design direction is to base the characters off the Aurebesh Alphabet from the Star Wars universe. Initial drawn sketch idea replaced.																	 |
