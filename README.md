Episode 03 THEME REVSION?

Planning to revise the theme, looking into a paint like style of art.

experimented with randomizing the sizes of the circle and the result was interesting, the next is to see how far i can take this sort of matte paint like style.

-take photos (REVISING)
-make theme (REVISING)
-experiment further with the code... more to go

(fixed the small lines that seperated the squares and ellipses in the code).
