Lego Faces

Have explored options with arrangement, taking inspiration from the layout and design of LEGO instructions, with the light blue/grey background and yellow trim, as well as numbers for each head. I plan on exploring this a bit more but really happy with how it looks at the moment.

Still planning on doing some work on the faces, mainly the mouths but other than that it is going well.
