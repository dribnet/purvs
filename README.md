Practice Sketch

Each letter is composed of two ellipses and a rectangle. The size and position of the first ellipse and the rectangle is fixed. But the size of the second elllipse is controlled by a parameter. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
