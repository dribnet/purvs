## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process and Development

So I just wanted to explore a differece version of using squares and rectangles for my images and I will compare and contrast the difference between this one and the other one to see what works will in a larger scale and also from a distance. I tired with ellipses aswell with this code but the uniformed ellipses along with the squares didn't work will togther and left an obvious lined gap between the person and the background. By keeping it one shape but altered differently so it makes the images look more seamless.
