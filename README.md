17.2.MDDN342 PS3

When looking into this first part of the assignment, I was really interested in using geometric shapes to create a tiling pattern.
I've always been interested in isometric views - I'm a big fan of the game Monument Valley, which takes inspiration from M.C. Escher drawings, optical illusions, and impossible objects.

I've decided to create a cube for my tiling pattern. So far, I've just been working on figuring out all the math required to make such an object. I mucked around with drawing it using sheared and rotated rects to begin with, but this got really confusing really quickly. So, I looked up how to draw hexagons (much easier than I thought), and then set about manipulating those first 6 points of the hexagon that I drew to get the rest of the cube's perspective.
