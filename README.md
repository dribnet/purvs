## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters is composed with three lines. The position, length and angle of the lines is not fixed so they change depending on the letter. 

The twelve parameters per letter:

  * posX1: first x position for the first line
  * posX2: second x position for the first line
  * posY1: first y position for the first line,
  * posY2: second y position for the first line,
  * offset1X1: x offset for the second line based on the first x position
  * offset1X2: x offset for the second line based on the second x position
  * offset1Y1: y offset for the second line based on the first y position
  * offset1Y2: y offset for the second line based on the second y position
  * offset2X1: x offset for the third line based on the first x position
  * offset2X2: x offset for the third line based on the second x position
  * offset2Y1: y offset for the third line based on the first y position
  * offset2Y2: y offset for the third line based on the second y position
