### Times of Life


I have altered my idea a little bit. I like the idea of my clock looking like the solar system, except the planets are the times of things that happen in the world. I'm hoping to get the to spin around the centre clock as if it is the sun but that'll depend whether or not I can figure out how to do that. I like using bright or neon colours on a dark background - it also gives that "solar system" feel to it.
