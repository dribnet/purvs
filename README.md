## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Andrija Djorovic

My Assignment started from the love I have for my best friend, as well as using element from my prevues assignments for this course, namely the Hexagons from Assignment 3 and the easy on the eyes background colour for the 2nd. 

With my There focusing around my dog I wanted to make him stand our even more then he already is, even thought he is the only think in the image. By making a clear foreground and background I found a way to do this, with out making it too intense.

Custom Pixel:
-Foreground: Itâ€™s using a fully filled hexagon; nothing special but still eye catching, as hexagon pixel do not feel natural but still gives you the details you need to comprehend what it is meant to be.
-Background: Using 3 layers of Concentric Hexagons, with the inner and outer ones using the colour given by the image and the middle one(that in the end looks like a hexagon ring) is white;
This gives it a nice and blurred out feel but still giving us the colours and details of the background without making it pop and take precedence from the foreground.

My Grid I a customised matrix, pushing each even row half of the side of the hexagons length sideways, as well as moving it higher for it to snap into the grid.

I make custom masks for each of my pieces, as the smartmask did not do a clean enough job with the outlines.

P.S. I did all of the work for this assignment in 2 days, I pushed this project back to focus on other courses. With that all of my commits and pushes will be one after each-other as I focused on finishing the project over clearly documenting it.
