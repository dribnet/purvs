## Part 2

I've integrated some features of my design from PS3. The design is from an idea I had for the last assignment but didn't execute. It's a simple tiling wallpaper that can be zoomed and panned across. I'm straying from my initial sketch idea as I figured that might've been a bit hard to do, and I think this would be more effective as just an abstract design.

Going forward I want to think of cool ways further detail can be revealed by zooming, as well as animation features.
