## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Furthering setup I have gotten the editor setup so I am all ready to roll with making the letters. I think first I will add in 1 or two more triangles as I currently don't have many parameters and doing this could make for some more interesting and uunique letter make ups.

the parameters per letter are:
  offsetx
  offsety
  stroke1
  stroke2
  scale2
