## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Today I fiddled around to make another parameter and had a little sketch of some interesting letter ideas I could create with my rainbow.I then edited my editor.js code to include all my parameters, and then used the editor.html as a tool to create a few of them. The editor.html was sooo helpful to create the letter looks I wanted without changing bits of code, saving it and refreshing my alphabet.html in my browser. The editor also helped to give me some new more abstract ideas! I'm have 14 parameters, but am not using the size one. I tried to delete it but my code would not run without it. I still have a couple to edit and want to have another look over.

Something else I did today was reduce the size of my overall rainbow and rays as you would have seen from yesterday's commit that they were too large, going outside the boundary - a few of the rays are touching the green boundary box so I just have to make sure this is okay.
