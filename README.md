THE ALPHABET + NUMBERS:

I've managed to finish my alphabet with just using the elements of the moon glyph. I also removed two parameters (end points for arcs) as I dont necessarily need them because the arcs are always half circles so what I've done instead was use the start angle and added 180 to it (start_a1 + 180) for the end parameter of the arcs. I've done the numbers as well so now I can just focus on refining them and think more about the design aspects of my alphabet.


Parameters:
line_x1 = x position for starting point of line
line_y1 = y position for starting point of line
line_x2	= x position for end point of line
line_y2	= y position for end point of line
arc1_posx = x position for first arc
arc1_posy = y position for first arc 
arc2_posx = x position for second arc
arc2_posy = y position for second arc
start_a1 = start angle for arc 1
start_a2 = start angle for arc 2
circ1_offset_x = offset x position for circle 1
circ1_offset_y = offset y position for circle 1
circ2_offset_x = offset x position for circle 2
circ2_offset_y = offset y position for circle 2
