The wallpaper is generated on an offset grid, the shapes are drawn completely with straight lines.
Clicking causes the colours to change. By using overlapping straight lines it looks like there are curves. The positioning of the grid causes circles to be formed by the shapes.

The scene is genrated using a noise function, the background is generated on a larger grid with smaller squares, the items are placed on a bigger grid whic is also generated by a noise fuction. The trees are then given a random shift so they don't sit in a perfect grid.

I tried to create a basic minimalist representation of a forest which has hutts in it. I chose to use the light yellow as the base for the background so the trees and hutts would stand out due to the contrast in colours. I also felt it worked best with the noise function to create a irregular background for the scene.

I started off with larger squares for the background with greater contrast but this really made everything look like it was on a grid, so I made the background sqaures alot smaller and made them have a smaller total colour spectrum so they would blend better with each other.
