The theme of my project is about objects from my past, which when held, allow me to remember memories that I normally wouldn't have access to.


Generally I wanted to create this fuzzy image, like a visual representation of what we see in our heads when thinking about memories. So despite not employing any 'outside the box' coding techniques, the simple ellipse and rectangle were what I wanted for my theme. I did experiments like adding color and changing the ellipses' shape, but the simplicity of the final image was more asthetically pleasing and fitting to the theme.


I wanted to create cracks in the background, while not having cracks when drawing the object, to create separation between the areas.

Using a background color of dark-grey allowed a brighter than black, but not as obtrusive as white(255) or another color.







I thought about not using smartmasking, but I tried it on photo_3, and found the smartmask was cleaner than if I used Photoshop.
For example, the edges are cleaner with smartmasking, but with Photoshop the edges were jaggered.

However, the smartmask couldn't identify the object in input_2. Also for input_1 it actually recognized the object as a teddy bear, but it didn't completely cover the bear.
So I used a manual mask for image 1 & 2, but use a smartmask for image 3.
