I changed my idea a bit. I want the font to be made up of the same arcs and be simpler so it is more confusing and interesting. The arcs will never come together to be full circles. How it will work is that the larger arc will rotate and the smaller one will rotate and move around to form the different letters and numbers. I decided to simplify it because I realised that my other idea would require too many parameters as well as it was really confusing to code. I like the look of this font better as it is just curves that rotate and move about. I'm sure if I will add in some other things but for now this is my initial idea 2.
