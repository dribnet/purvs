### Pill Clock

I coded this pill inspired clock by forming it with rectangular boxes to create a pixel graphic art style.
The colours of the two parts of the pill flashes into the opposite colour each second.
For my next attempt, I will change the text display of the hour and minute into numbers formed by rectangles so it matches my overall project pixel style. I will also add some smaller pill png image drawn in photoshop for my alarm function(small pills dropping down).
