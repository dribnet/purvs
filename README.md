-- I found it might be difficult to make capital letters such as 'B' with just 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle, so I decided to make my font in lowercase, and have made a new 'A'.







I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
