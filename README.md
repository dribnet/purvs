To help bring more personal identity, personality and emotion to each character I have set up 8 different slider variables.

The most significant in bringing diversity to the designs is the changing of the character colours. I set up HSB sliders so I could adjust these colour settings based on the represented person's hair colour. I used HSB so that I could have a primary and secondary colour based on brightness. This way the two character tones are always the same tone. This was done by mapping two different variables to the same origin variable.

Another key variable was adjusting for gender. I the bird and dog designs from my original art style to represent females and males respectively. Subsequent to this, in the case of males, I adjusted character ear length according to profile hair length.

I used eye lid height variables and look direction to help further convey emotion and personality.

I have gone through each of the training faces and mapped these variables accordingly.
