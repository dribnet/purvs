### Heartbeat Clock without alarm

This is my working heart beat clock without the alarm function. The heart gets bigger every half of a second and then gets smaller to give the effect of it beating. The circle that records the seconds moves smoothly instead of stepping as I thought it would make the heart "beat" stand out more.
