Here I have adapted my sketch to fit the alphabet format and has successfully added my sketch A B C to the letters.js and alphabet.js
However, I have gone outside of the (100,200) guidelines and I think this is okay? My design still works the gap between letters is just a little smaller then if I stuck to a width of 100. (Mine is 120).

Parameters:

  * `sizex` : size of x axis of smaller boxes
  * `sizey` : size of y axis of smaller boxes
  * 'offsetx' : x offset determines x position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * 'offsety' : y offset determines y position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * `boxX` : x position of second small square, relative to big square
  * `boxY` : y position of second small square, relative to big square
