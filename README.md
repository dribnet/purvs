## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I changed the orange outline to come in at point 6 instead of point 5 because i just didnt like the way they looked around the border/outside of the diamond. 

The progression is now as follows:

0. original pattern
1. dark diamond added
2. diamond is lightened, inner lines of main pattern is added.
3. diamond is lightened again
4. second pattern is added
5. Ellipses are added faintly
6. orange outer line appears, ellipses get darker
7. ellipses appear the same colour as the original background, orange outer lines get thicker


While still experimenting with the final pattern, I added the tour paths for easier navigation.
