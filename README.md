## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this final image I chose a image of some purple orchids. I like the way they look in this code with the crystal effect it looks pretty. They as almost too fuzzzy to see what they are but at the smae time you can see that it looks like shards f crystal glass. I think that it would be better if the background was lighter however I do like the focus on the flowers. I think that works well and I'm happy with how it turned out.
