## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Transfered my AB and C from the original sketch.js file and put all that code into the main files: alphabet and drawletters .js files. This helped in figuring out just how those new files are going to work further on into this project.

Also updated Index.html to make alphabet the main page when viewing in Purview
