## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

so i managed to get a sort of look that i liked for the background. all of the whole images look cohesive now. but i sort of wanted to get the mask for the background too, to have that separate again, but i wasn't able to work it out. I do like the way it looks now. i think for the moment it will just be subtly adjusting the variables as i think i am satisfied with how the overall concept looks at the moment.
