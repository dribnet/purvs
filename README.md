### ALARM

Here is a functioning clock with a working alarm. I will add further iterations to the aesthetic and animation of the alarm shapes in future pushes. 

Here you will see on-click that a faint ellipse will appear over the middle of the clock. This is the signifier for the imminent alarm which will be an ellipse that will cover the clock.
