## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After we had the guest lecture in class I decided on my theme. I was inspired by his work, and I decided to do my own work on the negatives of ocean pollution. I think it's an important message to spread. The first photo above I took at peka peka beach and the other two I took on the interislander. I'm going to uses these photos, I might photoshop them a bit as I'm planing to draw silhouette as the masks over the images.
