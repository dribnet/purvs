## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos from a trip to Japan I went on in 2015. They all share similar colours and moods so I thought they would be good subjects for this project. I made some simple masks to highlight the main subject of each photo.

At the moment I am just using the example code while I familiarise myself with it. Next, I will begin experimenting with my own custom pixel.
