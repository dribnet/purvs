For this practice sketch I opted to emulate the characters Mike Wazowski and James Sullivan from the movie Monsters Inc.
I chose to adopt a rather minimalist style and focus on the features I felt were most key in identifying the characters.

For Wazowski these key features were the green rounded body, the horns, and the single large eye.
For Sullivan the key features were the blue fur with purple spots, the teeth and the horns.

I primarily used ellipses and arcs to generate the characters, however in the case of Sullivan I used vertexes to create the more complicated shapes, such as the teeth and horns.

I opted to stylise the design with some shading. This was to bring some visual interest to the image and add a greater sense of depth.
