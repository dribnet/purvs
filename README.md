## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
07/06/2020
I choose the theme is Personal and I want to share my unforgettable scenes when I travel. These three photos are my favorite photos. Also, these scenes impressed me so hard to forget. I edited the size of the photos and start to do the masks.
Try to edit the sketch.js, but meet some problems. Index.html doesn't change when I change the sketch.js. Confusing. I will figure out tomorrow.

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
