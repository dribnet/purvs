## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

I've now finalised my design so that all the facial components from PS1 are being drawn using values calculated from the landmarks. This took a lot longer than expected to translate all the variables I'd meticulously calculated to using the landmarks, as I still wanted to retain similar face shapes and styles to the previous project.
