Part 3: Interpolation
5/5

This is currently my full alphabet. My next steps for this will mainly just be polishing up the final details with the colours and/or any letters/numbers that I'm not 100% happy with. I've also got the interpolation up and running, but it's just the basic one at this stage so I'd like to add some more to that - potentially an in between state as I'm mot completely happy with the transitioning of the horizontal and vertical lines, so I might have them shrink down to a dot before expanding into the new object/letter.
