## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

19/5 - Sorry for the big readme's in my previous commits, I will make sure that there is only the relevant readme update for my commits going forwards. I've added interaction to my code. It looks really nice- the arc travels around the circle, getting shorter or longer, and the movement/resizing of the circle is really nice too. The only problem is that currently, it's only animating the first circle. So the second circle dissapears, the first circle runs through its animation, and then the new second circle appears. All of the interaction maps look right, so I don't know whats happened there. Other than that, I'm really happy with how its looking, and I'm getting really close to being finished!


The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
