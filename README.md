Practice Sketch 2

Each letter is composed of three ellipses. I am playing aorund with having long lines leading off of the main shapes. I was trying to follow a ruel of making the main spine part of the letter thicker than the other line coming off of it. I want to stil play around with colour to make certain components of my letters stand out. Also I may change the long ellipses leading off to lines because it is becoming challenging to show letters like V with straight lines only.


The parameters per letter:
  
  * 'size': size of main ellipse backdrop
  * 'lh1': height of left long ellipse
  * 'lw1': width of left long ellipse
  * 'lh2': height of right long ellipse
  * 'lw2': width of right long ellipse
  * 'c1x': x position of main ellipse
  * 'c1y': y position of main ellipse
  * 'lx': x position of left long ellipse
  * 'ly': y position of left long ellipse
  * 'lx2': x position of right long ellipse
  * 'ly2': y position of right long ellipse
