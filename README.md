TYPOFONT

I wanted to create a font that is simple, minimalist and abstract but still readable. The color scheme I've picked for my font is a pastel pink for the stroke and a dark grey purple for the background. 

Each of my letters is made up of lines, each line represents one stroke in a letter and there are 4 lines. The lines are controlled by 16 parameters.

The 16 parameters per letter:
- l1x: The x coordinate of the first point of the first line
- l1y: The y coordinate of the first point of the first line
- l2x: The x coordinate of the second point of the first line
- l2y: The y coordinate of the second point of the first line
- l3x: The x coordinate of the first point of the second line
- l3y: The y coordinate of the first point of the second line
- l4x: The x coordinate of the second point of the second line
- l4y: The y coordinate of the second point of the second line
- l5x: The x coordinate of the first point of the third line
- l5y: The y coordinate of the first point of the third line
- l6x: The x coordinate of the second point of the third line
- l6y: The y coordinate of the second point of the third line
- l7x: The x coordinate of the first point of the fourth line
- l7y: The y coordinate of the first point of the fourth line
- l8x: The x coordinate of the second point of the fourth line
- l8y: The y coordinate of the second point of the fourth line
