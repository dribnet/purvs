## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

 After a lot of trial and error i was finally able to create smooth edges of each section in the mosaic tiles. I did this by adding an extra piece of code to the mosaic portion of the script. Rather than checking if the center of the tile is the correct alpha for the section of the mask being drawn in, it checks each corner of the quad. Then draws any other outside corners to the edge. 

 It looks strangely smooth now however so i may still experiment with a combination of sharp edges and jagged ones. 

 Ive also modified the script that draws the background, so the back drop has its brightness increased to create a brighter more "stained glass" appearene. 

 Ive added in the other two photos of my mum and run them trough the script, however I have yet to mask them as i am still tweaking the script and mask structure.
