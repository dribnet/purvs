## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
FINAL TOUCH UPS BEFORE HAND IN

I decided sticking to having my background animated, as I really enjoyed how the movement contrasted against my Kaka. How densely populated my background is from the cross-hatching would depend on how long each photo is displayed for. I purposely upped the number of i variables into my for loops to accelerate the amount of cross-hatch patterns that are drawn according to time. I also decided to remove the text from my first photo as I felt that unless the first photo was presented as a part of a full set, it would be hard to understand the context behind my choice of words. I decided to remove the text, as I felt that the photo was strong enough and impactful on its own, and that the other two photos would be okay to understand on their own.

My code still needs to be appropriately commented and cleaned up, so I plan to do last minute tweaks so that my set is ready for submission.
