Alphabet Final - 15/05/2020

This is the final outcome for each letter of the alphabet including numbers 0-9.

My final forms include 2 rectangles; one is fill only and the other is stroke only and are are controlled by 4 parameters each. I also have a single triangle with a lowered opacity stroke
so when it overlaps with the other two rectangles it creates a shadow. I have given my triangle the same colour fill as the background so it creates negative space in the letters which I 
think is a cool effect. The goal for this style was to create a sharp and bold font with a more gothic style - hence the idea of the fangs + blood. I wanted my letters to contrast against
a dark background showing more dominance however it still works well on ligth backgrounds as shown here: https://postimg.cc/5jC1t7bT

The colour scheme of red, black and white is selected from my inspired theme of fangs.


The 14 parameters per letter:
 • "offsetx": 17, | x position for first rect (filled)
 • "offsety": 0, | y position for first rect (filled)
 • "rectlength": 28, | first rect length (filled)
 • "rectheight": 90, | first rect height (filled)
 • "nofill_length": 20, | second rect length (no fill)
 • "nofill_height": 82, | second rect height (no fill)
 • "rect_twoposx": 55,  | x position for second rect (no fill)
 • "rect_twoposy": 4, | y position for second rect (no fill)
 • "triangleleftx": 188, | tri first point x
 • "trianglelefty": 270, | tri first point y
 • "triangletopx": 228, | tri secong point x
 • "triangletopy": 198, | tri second point y
 • "trianglerightx": 266, | tri third point x
 • "trianglerighty": 270, | tri third point y
