## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment

Continuing on, I have changed the background colour and the strokes of the letters, as I wanted them to be bright and colourful. Since all letters are rounded and the circle is a constant variable, I have decided to go with the theme of candy-- font name will be "eyecandy". I think the bright colours really conveys the theme and concept of lollies, since most lollies come rounded. I have updated my swapwords about desserts and candies. I will further tweak on the interaction of the letters.
