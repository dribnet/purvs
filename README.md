## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Update 1:
I chose three photos all taken in New Zealand. First one in Rotorua, second in Hamilton, third one is Napier. New Zealand is such a beautiful country which is why I want to show it through these pictures. Currently the circle & Rectangle point size are all different as I am still exploring designs.


update 2:
I added a function which draws stars on the white part of the mask. I really liked the look of it so added the same function to the black part of the mask. It made the images look like paintings which I really liked. However, I am not 100% happy with all three outputs so I will continue to play around with numbers until I find something which works for all three images.
