My idea is come from pizza, so I choose red line, orange line and two yellow circles, they are ham, cheese and squid or onion roll to constitute my letters. B is little bit different than A and C so letters create start from B because B has two circles if I solve the B than A, C will be easy. 

The 12 parameters per letter are now:
  * `rx1` : first x point of the red line.
  * `ry1` : first y point of the red line.
  * `rx2` : second x point of the red line.
  * `ry2` : second y point of the red line.
  * `ox1` : first x point of the orange line.
  * `oy1` : first y point of the orange line.
  * `ox2` : second x point of the orange line.
  * `oy2` : second y point of the orange line.
  * `ex` :  x point of the first yellow circle.
  * `ey` :  y point of the first yellow circle.
  * `ex2` :  x point of the second yellow circle.
  * `ey2` :  y point of the second yellow circle.
