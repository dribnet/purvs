## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
This is a test where I specifically wanted to manipulate the paint blob and make it more blurred, I adjusted it so it looks alot like the aperture setting on a camera when you turn your f stop right down. At the moment it is bluring my hatching lines as well which looks pretty cool, I want to adjust it so that it is only affecting the paint blobs instead. I've really manipulated pheobes star to look like a paint blob, by turning up the strokeWeight of shape I really got that blob effect that I wanted. It fits in with my abstract approach and im really happy with the results. Right now, I've solidified the design style I want, all I have to do is make sure everyting is the way I want it and manipulating my masks by tweaking the edges and shape of my subjects.
