SMARTMASK

I tried using the smartmask and found that it didnt really work for my subject matter as there are really only two components; the backgorund greenery and the flowers themselves. You can see from the labels_line it identified one of my flowers as a cake! So therefore i decideed to mask the images myself instead of using the smart mask. 
If my subject matter was more element heavy that's when i would have made use of the smartmask tool.
