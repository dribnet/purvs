## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

During the creation of the rest of the alphabat I started refining the style I had set in mtoion with the first few letters. Keeping arcs starting mostly between a set group of degrees so they are all fairly unifrom and with things like the numbers, where there is a theme of a horizontal line through the middle if possible. Im very happy with how legible the alphabet is already as thats something I really wanted to focus on.

The 9 parameters per letter:
* `line1R` : rotation of the first line around the centre of the letter
* `line2R` : rotation of the second line around the centre of the letter
* `line3R` : rotation of the third line around the centre of the letter
* `line4R` : rotation of the fourth line around the centre of the letter
* `arc1Start` : start of the first arc
* `arc1End` : end of the first arc
* `arc2Start` : start of the second arc
* `arc2End` : end of the second arc
* `lineOn` : the line length being between the radius and 0
