## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Currently trying to develop my current idea further. This is what I got up to in class today, I am trying to achieve a 3D effect. Going to look at adding a pop art texture next.

Currently I have 13 parameters:

*Shape1 the arc*
1. size: The size of the arc
2. offsetx: x offset of the arc
3. offsety: y offset of the arc
4. arcStart: starting angle for the arc
5. arcEnd: ending angle for the arc

*Shape2 the second circle*
6. size1: The size of the ciccke
7. offsetx2: x offset of the circle
8. offsety2: y offset of the cicrle

*Shape3 the rectangle*
9. width: width of the rectangle
10. height: height of the rectangle
11. offsetx3: x offset of the rectangle
12. offsety3: y offset of the rectangle
13. angle: angle of rotation of the rectangle
