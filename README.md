For the distribution part, I focus on forehead_value, eye_value, eyeRim_value, jaw_value and triangle_value.

In my case:
  There is 66% of chance that eyebrows are beyond face, 33% of chance that eyebrows are in face.

  Usually eyes look at the center, rarely eyes look at left and right sides.

  eye rims usually grow out of face, rarely grow inside the face.

  beard is usually higher than mouth, there is a low chance that follow the mouth curve or lower than mouth.

  triangles usually show, rarely there are no triangles.
