### A drop clock!

For this project my ideas are going to start with some sort of fluid movement of a numeric value dropping down into the screen and then progressively fall of the screen, going from left to right.


Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
