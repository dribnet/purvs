## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today, I was able to put in my own images and not have the code crash on me. I haven't found it too hard to understand what I need to change but I haven't updated my masks yet but I defenitely understand how to update the files and save the images. I took these images when I was on holiday in 2018 and the flowers create a lot of interest with all of the different colours

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
