### Super Clock Land

---

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time.

---

#### Changes:
+ Roughed together a quick water effect test

#### Current Issues:
+ Not really a clock.
+ Framerate is EXTREMELY fragile. Will need to take care not to ruin it.

#### To Do:
+ Current vision is a floating island in the Super Game Boy style I am fond of
+ Further refinement of water effect
+ Start actually implementing the scene
+ Nail down the colours

#### Notes:
+ Selective palette swapping could avoid the biggest issues with this. I should also look into taking advantage of transparency features
+ Resolution could be lowered further if need be
