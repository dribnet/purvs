SKETCH:

Shown above are my early sketches for the first 3 letters of my alphabet. I wish to be doing something with ellipses as I really like the round and curvy look of them, and in order to have more of this "round look" I will mostly be focusing on lower case letters. I want to be using soft pastel colours therefore I've settled with the clay and white colour for now. My parameters control the changes in terms of x/y position for line, x/y position for arcs, x/y position for circles and the start angles of my arcs.

Parameters:
line_x1 = x position for starting point of line
line_y1 = y position for starting point of line
line_x2	= x position for end point of line
line_y2	= y position for end point of line
arc1_posx = x position for first arc
arc1_posy = y position for first arc 
arc2_posx = x position for second arc
arc2_posy = y position for second arc
start_a1 = start angle for arc 1
start_a2 = start angle for arc 2
circ1_offset_x = offset x position for circle 1
circ1_offset_y = offset y position for circle 1
circ2_offset_x = offset x position for circle 2
circ2_offset_y = offset y position for circle 2
