## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Alright, I've updated my pictures to the ones I'm going to use. I'm not much of a photographer and all I had to work with was my phone camera and the lighting of my room so I'm not super confident as to the quality of the images. I'm trying to look at what I was talking about earlier with trying to make my surroundings reflect me while I've been stuck in my room. I photographed different sections of my room I've decorated and I wanted to have one of my hands in each shot so that you can see me living in and interacting with my room but in one shot I couldn't get my hand in the frame and take the picture at the same time so I had to use my foot. I was also having a really hard time taking the pictures with one hand so many of them took a lot of tries. Next I've got to edit my masks and start on the pixel work in earnest.
