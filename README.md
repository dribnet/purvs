## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So far I have already finish all the coding and rendering part. I am satisfied with the final result, especially for the colour tones.
Also I cleaned up the whole code in order to make it cleaner and tidier. I did not rename my variables because I think it could make sense now, just in case, I write the comments next to them.
