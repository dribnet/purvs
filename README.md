### My clock

I draw my clock and want to add some effect on it.

Here are some ideas that I can apply on the transition of AM/PM (or time):
lodine clock reaction (purple/yellow)
phenolphthalein indicator (red)
Methyl Orange (ren/orange/yellow) 

I may add some effect on the time at the bottom, but for now I will focus on the effect of the beakers.
