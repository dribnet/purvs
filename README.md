## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 12 parameters.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

I have completed the parameters for my alphabet so am now looking into different styles and what style will be used for my final alphabet.

 - Style Two
 	- Paper

 	This style aims to reflect my initial design idea, which was that of origami, the colours of each layer is changed to reflect that, as well as a white stroke to clearly define each layer.

 	The layers are still slightly transparent to allow for some distinction of the form beneath.
