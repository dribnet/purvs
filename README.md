I have based my letters around the gothic style of lettering. I will try use an arc, triangle and a line to do this.

I am currnetly completing my Alphabet. I have sketched how I invision the whole alphabet to look like.

I have twelve paramaters fore ach of my letters;
	"a1" : The first angle of the arc.
  	"a2" : The second Angle of the arc.

  	"tx1" : The first X location of the triangle.
  	"ty1" : The first Y location of the triangle.
  	"tx2" : The second X location of the triangle.
  	"ty2" : The second Y location of the triangle.
  	"tx3" : The third X location of the triangle.
  	"ty3" : The third Y location of the triangle.

  	"lx1" : The first X location of the line.
  	"ly1" : The first Y location of the line.
  	"lx2" : The second X location of the line.
  	"ly2" : The second Y location of the line.
