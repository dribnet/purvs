## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

[16/05] I finally opened up the intimidating draw_letters.js and letter.js, and I found it quite difficult trying to get things to show up on alphabet and encountered a few errors! But after a few tries I managed to get stuff to show up. I did A and B which were quite easy since I completed it in the sketch, however C was very difficult. However, I managed to get an idea done for C and from experimenting I managed to get a few parameters for other letters that I had planned to do. 

I will be doing things such as the colours later, but I just wanted something done in my code for the weekend.
