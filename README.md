## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

At this point I'm still playing with ideas, I quite like the mixture of the grid and the semi randomized grid. I also want to experiment more with the greyscale areas and the overall pixel density. I'm thinking if I change pixel density with different masks the code will need significant refacturing but overall could be worth it; seeing as at this point if the pixel density is to high the saveBlocksImages command crashes.

### Update:

I've now added multiple masks and the ability to use both the fully randomized script and the two grid style scripts in one porject.

### Notes:

One thing I've noticed is at very high image densities the texture of certain shapes just disapears lossing the effect of certain shapes

Mainly experimenting at this point with different shapes and the scaling of those shapes, it's a little hard to conceptualize at this point what will look best at different scales.

### Theming:

my current idea is separating the organic from the inorganic, using portraits of people pulling the organic elements body/hair/face to the front with colour. Then fading the inorgainic aspects into the background clothes/furniture with abstract and random point pattern
