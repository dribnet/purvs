Designing Alphabet (draft) Completed - 13/05/2020

I have completed all the letters in my alphabet including a the letter that will replace unrecognised symbols.
My parameters have been positioned to replicate capital letters more than lower case.

I will probably go back and refine some of th letters that I may not like as much such as letters A - D because I designed
those letters without the editor so they aren't proportioned the same; the triangles are bigger and seem larger which don't go with the rest of my letters.

I will also do some minor resizing for some of the letters because they don't perfectly line up. Some letters are taller / shorter.


The 14 parameters per letter:
 • "offsetx": 17, | x position for first rect (filled)
 • "offsety": 0, | y position for first rect (filled)
 • "rectlength": 28, | first rect length (filled)
 • "rectheight": 90, | first rect height (filled)
 • "nofill_length": 20, | second rect length (no fill)
 • "nofill_height": 82, | second rect height (no fill)
 • "rect_twoposx": 55,  | x position for second rect (no fill)
 • "rect_twoposy": 4, | y position for second rect (no fill)
 • "triangleleftx": 188, | tri first point x
 • "trianglelefty": 270, | tri first point y
 • "triangletopx": 228, | tri secong point x
 • "triangletopy": 198, | tri second point y
 • "trianglerightx": 266, | tri third point x
 • "trianglerighty": 270, | tri third point y
