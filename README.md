I have completed the whole alphabet and numbers.

I aimed to keep my designs to use shapes as close to a triangle as possible without turning them into lines too often.

The sketches i made on paper have been completely altered in my final design as i have been able to experiment and see what other combinations of triangles i could make to form the characters and numbers.

My original sketches i drew out were possible but i managed to be more creative when actually implementing the work.

My next step is to play around with the interaction and decide on the exhibition words.
