## Morse Code Alphabets

I've started playing around with using the concept of Morse Code to make my alphabets but I''m still having trouble figuring out all the parameters for each element. I will be looking further into this. 


The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
