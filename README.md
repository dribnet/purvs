## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

22/5/2020 11:05 am

My parameters are as follows:

-triangle 1
pos2x, pos2y, pos3x, pos3y, pos4x, pos4y);


-triangle 2
pos2x2, pos2y2, pos2x3, pos2y3, pos2x4, pos2y4);


 -triangle 3
 pos3x2, pos3y2, pos3x3, pos3y3, pos3x4, pos3y4);
  
  
 -quad
 x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);

I decided to stick with my challenge of having a maximum of 4 shapes. I am thinking of dropping one of the triangles to fit the brief, but I am simply glad I have something to show at this point.

I decided that it's better I have something to show as opposed to nothing, so I am now choosing to stop and submit whilst I have code working. 

This too far too much time to get working, so I am satisfied enough with how everything turned out in current situations. I would've liked to go with something more complex and aesthetically pleasing, but there simply wasn't enough time to create something incredible and working, fitting the brief completely, and that I would be satisfied with.

I am hoping that what I have here is enough to get me to pass this assignment, but time will obviously tell. At the very least, I think my choice of colour is clear and consise. The letters are readible enough, and they flow nicely between eachother.
