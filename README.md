Today I nearly finish my alphabet, but I still have some nice ideas want to realise. I plan to set a random colour of the inside of Oreas so that the colours will change randomly. For example, using pink to present shrawberry flavor and brown with chocolate flavor. Also I want to create more on the number "0" because so far it is the same with letter "O", which is not so satisfying.

The parameters per letter are now:
  * `status` : the status of cookies, standing or laying
  * `movex` : x position of where the coordinate of the first cookie will move to
  * `movey` : y position of where the coordinate of the first cookie will move to
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second column of cookies relative to the first column
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second column of cookies relative to the first column
  * `r` : how many degrees the first cookies should rotate
  * `r2` : how many degrees the cookies should rotate
  * `rotoffset` : rotate offset of the third cookie
  * `rotoffset2` : rotate offset of the fourth cookie
  * `gx` : x position of the gap between two cookies in the first column
  * `gy` : y position of the gap between two cookies in the first column
  * `g2x` : x position of the gap between two cookies in the second column
  * `g2y` : y position of the gap between two cookies in the second column
