## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of books I have read. The masks for each photo highlight various objects.

For this project my theme is books. For me I love reading as it is my way to escape the nosy lives we read. The books I have included are different books from some of my favorite series.
When taking the photos of the books I tried to arrange them in different layouts, then with the mask was highlighting different areas of books.
I have started to play around with the grid, to figure the best way to present my photos
