## 2020 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections


My idea is to create three variations of frogs. Some continuous variables will be the body shape, eye openness, eye position, and head shape. Some discrete variables will be if they're winking, eye pupil shape and mouth shape. Two variations will be full body and one will be a side-profile of the head.


Mostly finished the sideways frog head now. The head size, snout shape, eye type, mouth shape, colouring, and direction its facing can be changed.
