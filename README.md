Fleur de Niege (snow flower)

This project is about seasonal flowers. This project was inspired by my previous work which was also about flowers. I took some of the color scheme from the previous project too. The flower color scheme is a representation of the seasons blue being winter, red spring and then the yellow summer or the sun.
