This is a coded sketch of A, B and C. I simplified it massively because it was really confusing me. Previously I had attempted to creat a Maze type of code where my shape would travel and the wall of the grid would be removed so that the letter I wanted could be formed. To accomplish this I looked at the coding train's maze video, however once I developed the code I got confused. I over complicated it. Next I formed an array which I was going to use to create my grid, however that would not work with the code we were given. Therefore, I have stripped the code down to basic's. From here I need to alter it to fit the 12 parameters. Also I think it would be interesting to have the green morph underneath the grid rather then suddenly appeare within it. One thing I do like significantly about this sketch is the colours. I am going for a computer-ish/ similar to matrix look, therefore these colours work nicely.

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
