## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Bubbles!
Final!
Im really happy with how my design came out. I orginally wanted to create something like this, with rounded edges that kinda float into eachother to create words. I first created a black and white alphabet using only 3 ellipses however that was rather dull and strayed away from my orginal idea. (This idea is saved in the Json under "First Alphabet")

From here I had a similar idea where I only use lines. I thought that only using one type of imput would help keep my design minimal which it did for the most part. I did want to keep my text readable too and for it to be soft and easy to look at. 

I wanted to create a transition that would help emphasize the bubbles, I liked the slow transition of the basic transition but I still wanted to make it more unique so I changed the stroke weight (SW) of one of my lines in the space of 70% - 100% Making it stationary for the first 70% then making it suddenly get larger or smaller. Making it look like the bubble is combining and growing or suddenly popping. I think this creates a fun bubbly element which ties in nicely with my design.

Unfortunately during the middle of the project I wasnt able to commit my work so I had to hold off commiting until I fixed the bug. I also just do a lot of work on my project at one time and I do forget to commit often. leaving me with only a few comits. 




Edits on this commit.

I have fixed the issue with transitions when my yellow line would instantly vanish, I just moved this and unused elements for specifc letters off the page in a way it would become invisable. 

I also added the exhibition to display
