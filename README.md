## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 12 parameters.

The trangles also use a fill with a slight opacty giving it a layered look.

I have redone my parameter system to allow for rotation during the transform/animation, the new parameters are as follows.
The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

 - Alphabet still WIP
 - Redesigned parameter system/simplified inputs dramatically
 - Exploring alternative colour schemes.
