## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

My original idea was alot different than my current one. The first original sketch was done in p5js and taking it into the aplhabet I realised that it exceeded 12 parameters and had around 18. 

My intent was to make it look 3d with just simple shapes but added a shadow to make it feel more alive. 

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
