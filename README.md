Sketch Ideas Experiment Two - 10/05/20

This is my second experiment with the abc sketch. I wanted to develop my idea more and add more parameters so more of
my shapes are flexible in movement.I wanted to keep my rectangular shapes in my design because I find the look of 
straight and parallel lines very neat when it comes to designing a style for letters. You will also notice that
I have chosen not to continue with the pixel font idea because I would have needed multiple parameters (probably exceeding limit).

I experimented with triangles instead because it's sharp but at the same time they have straight lines. I lowered the opacity
of my triangle which created this nice transparent effect over my rectangles.

I found my colour palette from colourlovers: https://www.colourlovers.com/palette/740/sprained_minds
This palette reminds me of vampires so I will base my lettering off of blood (red) and fangs (triangle).

The 14 parameters per letter:
 • "offsetx": 17, | x position for first rect (filled)
 • "offsety": 0, | y position for first rect (filled)
 • "rectlength": 28, | first rect length
 • "rectheight": 90, | first rect height
 • "nofill_length": 20, | second rect length (no fill)
 • "nofill_height": 82, | second rect height (no fill)
 • "rect_twoposx": 55,  | x position for second rect
 • "rect_twoposy": 4, | y position for second rect
 • "triangleleftx": 188, | tri first point x
 • "trianglelefty": 270, | tri first point y
 • "triangletopx": 228, | tri secong point x
 • "triangletopy": 198, | tri second point y
 • "trianglerightx": 266, | tri third point x
 • "trianglerighty": 270, | tri third point y
