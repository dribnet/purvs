## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this project my inital idea was to look at the beauty we miss in our life. What is beauty though, isn't it subjective? Well to me what I find beautiful and gains my attention is the beauty in nature that is all around us. 



Looking at technology  in today's society we have things such as  phones, laptops, tablets and even portable gaming consoles. The fact is that we spend majority of our day in our screens we come across the chanc to miss the world every day.

I am  specifically looking at flowers as my subject matter which in my opnion is aesthetically pleasing in so many areas. Forms, colours and symmetry pull me to this beauty.

The saying “to stop and smell the roses” is an excellent example of what I wanted to highlight in regards to taking a step out of our day to look at the world outside of our phones .

The way I wanted to portray this is to have a flower on the screen of a phone but have a bunch of flowers in the back to emphasise that beautiful things we see come from aspects that aren't seen on a screen but rather with our eyes.

I want to look at texturing differing parts and using filters to draw attention and detail to what is on the phone in the shot, encouraging the viewer to not be able to fully see their surroundings but what is on the screen in hand.
