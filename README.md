## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Following more feedback, I have changed the rectangles for the eyes of the cows to be circles. This makes my design a lot more cohesive with the ovals that are drawing the cows face. My next steps will be to continue refining the code and I may try experimenting with the pixel function that was given in todays class to see if it will work in with my design. I have just implemented the purview.json file so I will also work on putting in the commits that I want to show. 

Theme:
I have chosen farming as my theme for this project as it is something personal to me that I care about. Farming gets a lot of bad media that does not express what farming is really about. Therefore, I took into consideration the location of where the work would be displayed as most people who may view it will have a limited experience with farming. I want to express the beauty of farming and contrast the bad pictures that are presented in the media.

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
