Final.

List of parameters:
  width
  height
  c2offsetx
  c2offsety
  c3offsetx
  c3offsety

  With my final I really wanted to execute a final that focused more on the code rather than the design, which is why I decided to create a block letter alphabet that was simple and easy to understand. I overcame several challenges over this project, for instance; it took me almost a week to realise that naming my parameter c1offsetx, c1offsety, rather that c2offsetx, c2offsety, would cause my alphbet to crash. 

  My final incoporates the basic shape of ellipses. To the eye we only see one shape, but if we look at the code we see that there are three shapes involved in each character, and the two we don't see are coloured the same as the background. This is ultimately my solution to executing the block letter style that we see in exhibition.html.

  Overall I am pleased with how fair I have come in this project 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
