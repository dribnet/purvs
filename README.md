Finished my letter set! Ovrerall I'm very happy with the look of most of my letters and numbers. I think the style carried over well into the whole alphabet, and the challenge of using a minimal amount of parameters was engaging and a lot of fun messing around with each letter or number until I felt it looked right.




So far my parameters include:
  "size"    = hieght of ellipse
  "sizeW"   = width of ellipse 
  "offsetx" = x position offset from origin
  "offsety" = y position offset from origin
  "rectL"   = length of rectangle
  "rectW"   = height of rectangle
  "radi"    = radius of rectangle corners
  "ellPosx" = x position of the ellipse
  "ellPosy" = y position of the ellipse
