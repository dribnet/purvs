Final README

Spillage is a font that has always been minimal. At the beginning of this project, I set myself the challenge of only using two shapes: one rect and one ellipse. Because of this limitation, some of the letters were difficult to make, however I'm very pleased with the overall look and feel of my font. 
I ended up only needing 9 parameters in total which I was very happy with. I did consider at multiple points adding another shape in order to make the more difficult letters, but decided against it as I felt it would detract from the minimal aesthetic. I drew inspriation from Bauhaus design ideology when coming up with my letters, as well as for the colour scheme. I wanted three main distinct colours so there would be a strong contrast between the background, and the two shapes that made up each letter/number.

I learned a lot from this project, and had a lot of fun playing around designing each letter. I actually didn't use the editor because I never felt at any point that the process of shifting around my shapes was difficult or tedious. It actually reinforced the x, y coordinate system and really drilled it into me because I had to recognise what changes needed to be made, then visualise what that translated to in terms of the x and y values.  


My final parameters were the following:

  "size"    = hieght of ellipse
  "sizeW"   = width of ellipse 
  "offsetx" = x position of the rectangle
  "offsety" = y position of the rectangle
  "rectL"   = length of rectangle
  "rectW"   = height of rectangle
  "radi"    = radius of rectangle corners
  "ellPosx" = x position of the ellipse
  "ellPosy" = y position of the ellipse
