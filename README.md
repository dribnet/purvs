## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Sketch

I added a third ellipse to my letters. Each letter is shaped like a lollipop and each are a different size.
Each of the three ellipses makes up the lollipop, the shadow and the stick.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
