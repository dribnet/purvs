Reflection
There were many trials and tribulations during this project.  Coming up with a style for the alphabet was one of the hardest parts in this project.  It took a while to come up with a good idea.  Once, I thought about the idea of a block like font the idea started to become more apparent.  The hardest part of this project was the code.  I did not understand how the code worked at first.  It took awhile to completely understand the code and how to add parameters to the code took a while.  With a little guidance in the right direction the code started to make sense.  Once the code had been established the project became a lot easier to undertake.  The most challenging letters and numbers to make were “E,” “5”, “S”, “3”, and the “2”.  These numbers and letters had many challenges to them.  The hardest part about the “S” and the ”2” was to make sure they were not too similar.  Since the “2” and “S” are similar in shape it was hard to make them different so that is why the “2” is in roman numeral form.  The “3” was quite challenge because they have curves and since I was mostly working with three rectangles it was hard to bridge the gap between the “arms” on the “3”.  That is why the 3 seems to be missing something.  The way that the 3 was made is also an interesting take on a number.  The next letter that was a little difficult to make was the “E”.  At first, I thought the “E” had to be an uppercase letter.  Then it was changed to look like a lowercase “e”.  This was a great change because it could have looked to like the “3” or it could have been a rotation of the “W”.  The hardest number to make so far has been the “5”.  The current limitations on the project have not helped with making a “5” in any capacity.  The “5” has either looked to like the “7” or the “6”.  It never had its own distinct look.  That is why the “5” has been made into the roman numeral “5”.  The interpolation was quite easy to sort out.  It just took a little tweaking with the numbers, and it turned out well.  The color palette went through many changes.  At first it was the standard blue background, and the letters were white and black.  Then the palette changed for the letters to a red, purple, and green.  Then the palette finally changed to a turquoise, aqua, and purple color palette.  The background changed from a light blue, to purple, and it ended with a light green.  In the end the project really helped with getting re-familiarized with maps and variables.
