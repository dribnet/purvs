### My idea of project#1

I'm looking for some simple old fashion clock. My theme is going to be a flower, while the time is running, the enviroment around a clock will changing like a season change. The p5js coded, I may use scale(); function to animated my drawing like a fruit is growing. Also I may put images in my sketch too.
