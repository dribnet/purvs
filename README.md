DESIGN THE ALPHABET:

A style which I've taken from part one are the curves and circles. After doing a lot of research and looking into the history of writing, I've found out about hieroglyphics. This then led me to searching up glyphs and have found this symbol for a moon glyph. It consists of a straight line, two arcs and two small circles. I then decided to take insipiration from this glyph and base my alphabet on its elements to sort of create an alphabet which has a modern take on hieroglyphics but making the letters be a lot more readable (not symbols). For the line, the arcs and the circles, here are my parameters.

Parameters:
line_x1 = x position for starting point of line
line_y1 = y position for starting point of line
line_x2	= x position for end point of line
line_y2	= y position for end point of line
arc1_posx = x position for first arc
arc1_posy = y position for first arc 
arc2_posx = x position for second arc
arc2_posy = y position for second arc
start_a1 = start angle for arc 1
end_a1 = end angle for arc 1
start_a2 = start angle for arc 2
end_a2 = end angle for arc 2
circ1_offset_x = offset x position for circle 1
circ1_offset_y = offset y position for circle 1
circ2_offset_x = offset x position for circle 2
circ2_offset_y = offset y position for circle 2
