I wasn't quite happy with the amount of distribution of randomness as the sprites were still looking quite similar. Therefore I added some randomness to the eye size along with some randomness in the twigs growing out of their heads' size. 

I also added some randomness to their position on the canvas, and added some more sprites. All the html controls are gone and the canvas changes every 5 seconds or when you click the mouse.
