## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Continuing to use the perlin noise algorithm, This time with my own images. The flowfield has a lot of undulating lines which reminds me of the ocean, for my own images I have pictures of the ocean by Red rocks, Wellington. The first image is an image of a rock protruding out of the water and I had 2000 particles be generated to create the flowfield. The second image is seaweed underneath the water and I had 4000 particles generated to create the flowfield. The last image is a low angle shot of a rockpool with 6000 particles. I applied no masks to the image or in the code and I still have to port my code into the project folder.
