## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I've done the interpolation, but some of the letters are snapping, and not animating smoothly. I've also had a few comments on my current colour scheme, about how the background colour is ugly, and I agree. I found the two colours on a colour pallete website, and it reminded me of ink on craft paper. I thought it worked well together, but the contrast of so much of the yellowy brown to only a little bit of the black does clash a little bit.

My next step is to try to fix the interpolation, and make it animate smoother, and try again with a different colour pallete.

I have decided that I want to lean more into the fun, rounded look of the characters. I've been playing around with some purples, blues, and pinks. I'd like to keep the pastel base that I originally had as well. I'm currently having a hard time choosing between doing my alphabet with noFill on the custom chape or having it filled.
