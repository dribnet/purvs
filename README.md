## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

more focus experimentation

Definitely gonna go with this theme. Having a more solid subject makes things a lot easier to work with. Need a third image, but that shouldn't be too hard. Also might modify the current ones - image 1 I feel should have the focus closer in frame while image 2 could do with an extra item in there. I wish I had my joint from DSDN 111 last year for that, but last I saw that was broken in a display case and it's kinda too specific an item anyway.

In this specific iteration I pushed the object to be more painterly and greyscaled out the rest of the image. Outside of colour I think the background and object are too close, however. I'll be looking into some cross-hatchy/sketchy styles next, and am thinking I might make the background and foreground sketchy while making the object look more painted and completed.

Note that the first 3 frames of pixel generation are rather slow. It speeds up a lot after that.
