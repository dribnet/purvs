## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have started to build the framework and plan out how I will draw each characters.

This included updating the parameters to by removing the current parameters and adding in some new ones listed below that will change over time.

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * lines : an array of 1s and 0s that let the line algroithm know whether or not to "light up" or "turn on" a particular line
  * letterColour : Contains the letters colour
