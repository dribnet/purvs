## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is another design that i thought of. I wanted to see what it would look like if the circles had no fill and stroke would stay the same colour of the image and you're still able to have a clear idea of what the image is. I do really like how it looked. The main focus is now more on my theme, which is the landscape and the different sky colours now stand out a lot more and has become dominant.
