## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Back to old idea again

I found this whacky projection called Atlantis which I am now in love with, I can do a portrait map projection and portray some interesting data on it. I plan to make it a data visualizer proportionate to population e. make a carbon emissions map that shows the worst places per capita.
