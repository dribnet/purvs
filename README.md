The variation in face shape has made a big difference to the sketch, but they're all quite rendom and different. I really like the idea that we can control the randomness with the focusedRandom function, and had actually begun to try and do this to the eyebrows and eyelids through a primitive series of if statements. The focusedRandom solution is much more refined. 

The focussing of the randomness has a particularly good effect when applied to the roundness of the cheeks: I've distributed it so that there are a lot less faces with rounded cheeks, which makes the outliers really stand out and give off the impression that they are smiling. Due to this alteration, I am beginning to think that I won't need to add in other facial features at all, as the faces are quite expressive without them.
