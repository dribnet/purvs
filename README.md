## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today I have simplified down my masks to allow for more creativity going forward. I am really like where I have got to in my design because I am now able to play around with the different layers of mask and smoothing out the colours of the masks.

I also am pleased that I changed my last photo. As much as all of the photos are viewed for the same angle, it has a better connection to each other and theme of natural beauty. Now I need to look into how I can take my design to the next level.

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
