## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The Collection

For my final, I decided to use images of my shoes. I chose to this because of my love for shoes and through this project I wanted to show the different characteristics that each shoe can represent. I chose these shoes as they exhibit different personalities and styles that a person could have. Each shoe represents a different person and a different sense of style when it comes to fashion and clothing. I experimented with rectangles and ellipses but I decided to use ellipses for my final as it shows the shoes more, as I wanted the shoes to be the main focus. With my other commits, it gives off a different vibe to the image as they are fading away instead and blowing away into the distance.
