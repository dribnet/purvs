## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel Experiment 2

As mentioned before, I think the png image file takes up
too much of my overall rendered image. Therefore in this
version update, I have redone the skin and hair png with
photoshop and refine it so it looks cleaner and then coded
the religion glyphs on top.

Next step:

- Redo and fine my other 2 models' skin and hair png.
- Continue coding other religion glyphs.
- Try other background glyph/ outfit glyph if still have spare time.
