## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Project updates for Karen O'Brien

In this test I played around with whether or not I want to make my images look like they've been needle painted or embroidered. Since cross stitch is very organized I decided that this code is a bit too random for it and I'm going to experiment with a needle painted embroidery look instead.

For this project I want to take inspiration from both my own and many of my family member's passion for embroidery by taking photos of places/ objects of significance to my family and making them look like pieces of embroidery or cross stitch. To do this I plan to block out each object in different colours then apply an overlay that makes the image look as if it has been embroidered.

Some examples of images I am thinking of using are of flowers from my Nanna's garden and backyard, although I'm worried that I won't be able to portray the message I'm going for so I need to make sure that all the images I use have a strong sense of nostalgia. Currently I've put in some temporary photos and masks of some pictures I took while abroad in Europe a few years ago, while these are a bit further from what I want the final images to be, they still have significance to my family as these are some of my Grandparents (and my own) favourite places in the world.
