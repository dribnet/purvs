## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my final and I finally decided to changed the ellipses into diamond geometries. For my ideas, I really want to make my images looking like pixelated while The transportations in the images are different to the other parts of the images. And I have got the inspiration from famous LEGO company, as a result, I want the appearances of transportantion that is similar to LEGO toys. Because Wellington trains and cable cars are one of the most important transportations, I think that the crossing grids would be good examples for representing the network of transports. Also the diamond geometries are quite organised when they are combined together. 

At the same time, I think yellow and red would be the symbol colors for Wellington (Just like Wellington soccer team Phoenix), Therefore, I choose cable cars and trains for the representation of Wellington. I have think about different colors buses. However, I think previous transports (cable cars & trains) are unique for Wellington. 

Personally I really like the first image (Blue sky and an unique train), I think that one is perfectly suitable to my theme Wellington transportation. Meanwhile, the image looks like making by many pieces LEGOs. 

Additonally I quite enjoy this project.
