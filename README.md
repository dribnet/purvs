I started looking at how my alphabet and numbers would appear using interpolation, then seeing how they would appear in exhibition. PLugging my letters and numbers in was a good way to see if all my individual arcs lined up correctly and if any adjustments needed to be made my letters. I most certainly need to adjust my set further as some arcs did not line up right, and the spacing between letter forms altered, which interrupted the flow of the word that my letters were spelling out.

The fourteen parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
