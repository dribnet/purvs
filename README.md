## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Each of my letters is composed of three triangles however some of them will only need require two triangles so the last will either be commented out or given null values. None of the size or position of the triangles will be fixed as I need the flexibility considering I am using the triangle function to make them rather than using vertex which requires 6 parameters per triangle. This brings me close to the limit of 20 variables but I like it for the added flexibility.


The 18parameters per letter are :
"1Trix1": 0, x coordinate of first point of triangle
"1Triy1": 20, y coordinate of first point of triangle
"1Trix2": 20, x coordinate of second point of triangle
"1Triy2": 0, y coordinate of second point of triangle
"1Trix3": 60, x coordinate of third point of triangle
"1Triy3": 120, y coordinate of third point of triangle

"2Trix1": 100, The rest of the variables are self explanatory
"2Triy1": 200,
"2Trix2": 200,
"2Triy2": 100,
"2Trix3": 300,
"2Triy3": 200

"3Trix1": 37,
"3Triy1": 11,
"3Trix2": 68,
"3Triy2": 62,
"3Trix3": 15,
"3Triy3": 62
