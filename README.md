## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For the first push I wanted to see what the detail was like when rendering so I grabbed a screenshot of an NZ focused google earth. It took about 30 mins to render the most detailed version and close to 10 for the less detailed.

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
