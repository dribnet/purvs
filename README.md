## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Replaced image 1 with one of the pics I have cycling as a desktop background. I'm finding I like the look of it with more, smaller than default pixels better. The output almost reminds me of some paintings I've seen. Thumbnail and preview are bugged unfortunately.
