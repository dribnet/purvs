## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

01/04	My letterforms work by having each parameter correspond with one point of each triangle. 2 triangles = 12 parameters per letterform. The red triangle uses the parameters point1A, point2A, point3A, point1B, point2B, point3B. The black triangle uses the parameters point1C, point2C, point3C, point1D, point2D, point3D.
I have to consider how I'm using negative space and whether am applying it consistently, and having the numbers use the black triangle as the dominant triangle in the letterform to distiinguish them from the main alphabet.
I plugged my variables into the interpolate_letter function so now it does the smooth animation transfer between letters. It looks pretty cool, but I think I've mixed a lot of my parameters. For example, if a the letter "I" has an upward equalateral triangle, and then I type "Y" the triangle flips because the points aren't used consistently. I'll have to sit down for a couple of hours with a podcast on and go through polishing my parameters code.
The exhibition.html is a cool place to hang out and try thinking of words to challenge my font to see how well it works. As I expected, the "E", "M", "N" etc, are pretty difficult to read, and my "E" and "Z" look almost identical. I saw this coming, because my "E" is a lowercase placeholder (because I didn't really know how to make an E), where everything else is uppercase. I'll work on it :)
