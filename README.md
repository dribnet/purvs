## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Here i am exploring the flowers. I wanted to pick images with vibrant colours and also different varieties of flowers. At the moment i haven't play much more around with the coding, so that will be something to look into. I also am unsure how to use the masks so that potentially there are 3 different components so i guess i need to assign one to the 50% gray.
