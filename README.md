## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my practise image, it is my hand holding a crystal. I chose it because I thought the colors woud work well and I like the image's subject, the crystal.

**EDIT**
The three panels should now match correctly to the new works (which are shots from my short film for project 2 of another design course).
