### Slit Scan Initials 3

Been trying to figure out how to apply the slit pixel data to the arcs. Since copy always creates a square image I was trying to find a way around it ended up creating some sort of video display function in the process.
Was thinking of using multiple bezier curves to create my arcs but not sure. Needed to have put more focus on the project.

Video input isn't optimized on Chrome.
