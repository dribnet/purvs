Development and progress

So I realised when I tried using lines and ellipses at first but I noticed that a few of the letters couldn't be drawn using those shapes and arcs needed to be used but when I drew them in I founf out that the ellipses were not needed as I could draw round circles using an ellipse and still have curved parts without having a lot of paramaters. I also used alternating colours as I decided to use the lines and oulines and not filled shapes.

The parameters per letter:
  * `width` : for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `height`: for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `offsetx` : x position for all my shapes but I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `offsety` : y position for all my shapes but I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
