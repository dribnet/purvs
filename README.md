## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

In this project, I tended to achieve the goal of chidlhood memeory by design of Pokemon. 

Idea: I was inspired by Pok√©mon(Pocket Monsters). My idea was about trainer (you) go inside of the ball to see the Pokemon. I did not draw Pikachu this time because Pikachu is too famous and predictable. If we mention Pokemon, most of people will think about Pikachu. But I was aiming to do something unpredictable in this project to surprise people. So I chose marill.

Levels Decision: My original idea is showing many Poke balls at the beginning. Then the Poke balls will be taken half of it when you zoom in to next leverl. Each zoom in means you go further into the inside of the balls. For the next level, you will see Pokemon (sleepy marill). The reason why it shows sleepy marill is that you need to wake it up in next level. Therefore, woke up marill will appear in the last level.

Animation: Because we can't use rotate function to do the rotation directly, so it would be the most diffcult part for me when I animated the objects. After asking for help, I changed p5.rotate() as p5.sin() and p5.cos(). On the other hand, I made some animation for marill's facial expressions to express its situation, like sleepy, woke up.

Color selection: I kept using the colors from my sketch, such as red, blue, white and black. It can match my original idea well. Also, I thought of those textures of elements, like smooth tail balls and smooth Poke balls. 


Zoom 0: Poke balls
Zoom 1: half Poke balls
Zoom 2: half Poke balls & tail part
Zoom 3: half Poke balls & sleepy marill
Zoom 4: half Poke balls & woke up marill
