### Sine Wave Clock
My design is to have a static sine wave drawn on the canvas with different balls along it, each ball being a unit of time. The distance the balls are along the sine wave relates to the time they represent.

I have got my sine wave clock working as a functioning clock now. Each ball represents a unit of time from smallest to largest - millis to hours and they travel along the sine wave near perfectly, I also had to smooth all of their movement so it wasnt jagged. I have implemented a day/night colour change. From 7am-7pm there is a light yellow 'day' colour scheme and from 7pm-7am there is a dark blue 'night' colour scheme.
