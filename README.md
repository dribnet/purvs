## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have started working with a star pattern and trying to make this work with my photos. I am liking the out come of this and will keep experimenting and playing with the masks to see what i can get etc. 

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
