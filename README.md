Final Concept 
I decided on using a system that has a bunch of x & y postions for each rectangle shown.This makes it easier to customize my letters and make sure they all look unique. The downside however is that it requires alot of parameters (16).

The 16 parameters per letter:
  * `p1offsetX` : x offset of first rectangle.
  * `p1offsetY` : y offset of first rectangle.
  ... p8offsetY..
