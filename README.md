## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Part 2: Theme:
The group of photos I've used don't have much in common inherently but I decided to try using the mask to really push the objects within them to the foreground (contrast between small, scarce pixels and big, densely packed pixels). I did this subtly for the building image, less sublty for the fire hydrant image, and extremely obviously for the dog photo. I think from here I need to fool around with the sketch.js and the masks to find out what works best for contrasting objects from their background.

Part 1: Photographic Sketches:
I started off with the image of the praying mantis but I found it wasn't very interesting because of the lack of colour (pretty much all black and green). I decided to use an image of this building and adjusted the algorithm to put it in the forefront.
