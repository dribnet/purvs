I started off working on sketch.js to get the used to the way this Assignment works. It took me a while to understand the way this code works, but it started to make more sense after I added some variables. Once I had a better idea of what I was doing I started working on the alphabet. I chose to use triangles as I thought I would be able to manipulate different forms more easily. I also used a lot of ellipses for assingment 1, so I thought this would be a good change. I chose different shades of turquoise for my colours, but I might change the opacity later on once all letters/numbers are finished and I can see it all clearly. While I was adding on letters, a few new ideas came to my mind, but I will edit them once I actually get all the letters done.

Update 2.
I finished the alphabet and added some shapes to letters that only had 2 triangles. My next step is to do the numbers. Once that is done I will play around with stroke and opacity.
