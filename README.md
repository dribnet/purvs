## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Working through the in-class tutorials. Created a star eyes function where i made huge stars in the mask. 

The images above are photos of my friend from an assignment from last year in the studio algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
