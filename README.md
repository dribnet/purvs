So far I am still working on the alphabet and trying to use triangles to define my letters. The idea was to have a 'ninja' kind of font which had sharp edges which I was going for with my idea, with swords and etc.
At first I did struggle heaps but I recieved help from a tutor and I am back on track. Since I was constantly changing ideas because I thought the original wouldn't work. 

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
