Im going to use to only use drawface1 so that I can use discrete variables to control everything. As all the faces use the same parameters.

Im going to try use discrete variable mainly for colour but I have already used it for blushing on/off and mouth open/closed.

For the weighted one I worked on the colour. I put in a 2:1 chance of it being light brown althoguh I plan to add more colors once I test combos.
