## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For testing, I took an image processing script that I made over the summer for a photography project. I can't remember exactly what my code does because I didn't comment what it does because I was more focused on the output images, but from what I remember it uses the perlin noise algorithm to generate a perlin noise flowfield onto the canvas and the colour of the particles is based on the pixel colour of the image. Because of the length of the particles(lines) they're bigger than a pixel size so the image has a compressed/distorted look.
