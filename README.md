## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In this class, I replace the images. The topic of this series of image is about 'criminal scene'. For what the photos that I have now, I don't really like their effect. The color of the photos is not really strong enough to present my topic. Over the weekend, I will take more photos. On those photos, the feeling that I want to present is 'mystery', 'heartbeating' and the 'blood' color is really vivid under a blue/cold background.

The reason that I choose this topic is because I really love criminal drama and I feel it is a really stylist and special topic. Using three images to talk about a stroy and criminal topic can make the viewers think "oh, what is going on?"
