### Drawing Styles - Monsters, Robots and Bears

For my three drawings styles I have chosen to create faces that are heavily inspired by animation. Each face has one discrete setting and four variable settings.  

The discrete setting has been used to control the number of eyes (monster), number of antennas (robot) and colour scheme (bear).

The variable settings are as follows:

#### Monster

1. Eye Size
2. Main Hue
3. Zig Zag
4. Scale

#### Robot

1. Face Height
2. Colour
3. Mouth Style
4. Face Shape

#### Bear

1. Face Size
2. Outer Mouth Size
3. Eye Position/Style
4. Inner Ear Position

I had various reasons for which parameters of the faces I choose to add controls to.  For the bear my choices were driven by my goal to make it possible to create various famous cartoon bears with the controls.  

The most interesting parameters I choose for the robot were the face shape, mouth style and number of antennas. I choose these parameters as they allowed me to create the most variation.

The monster was driven mainly by my desire to create an interesting face pattern that is also controllable.  The Zig Zag control determines the level of Zig Zag present in the pattern. I also thought that controlling the scale could offer some interesting potential for filling the canvas with a lot of characters.
