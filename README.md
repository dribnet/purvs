## Powers of 10 PRINT

I created additional graphical assets for the computer desk scene. I wanted to further enforce the atmosphere of a cluttered work desk. 

To help the zone transitioning appear smoother and make more sense I decided to create a targeted bounding box for the pattern to appear in. This zone is dependant on the grid lines so this meant I had to adjust the computer screen design to accomodate the grid size and position. I gave a small boundary from the edges of the computer screen to where the pattern starts. This was to softern the shift in visual weight between these elements. Unfortunately the grid does not align perfectly with the computer screen bounds at higher levels of zoom.

When looking at creating further zone levels and more variation I decided to draw additional pattern elements on top of the existing lines. I felt this was appropriate to the idea of components of the computer being made up of smaller and smaller components.

I also looked into experimenting with the colour palette. In this example I've looked into a greyscale palette. This was to complement the screen colour better and reduce the contrast between the computer design and the pattern design.
