I used a ellipse and a rect to form the shape of a matchstick as the prototype and then copied three of the same to form a group.
Andthen after that I can arbitrarily combine the letters that I want.

All the letters have created, and the combination of the two letters "M" and "W" is somewhat tricky. 
Considering the length and width limitations, I can only make them overlap in some places so that the display will be much smaller than the other letters, but I try to combine them.



The twelve parameters per letter:

  let posX1 = letterData["X1"];
  let posY1 = letterData["Y1"];
  let posX2 = letterData["X2"];
  let posY2 = letterData["Y2"];
  let posX3 = letterData["X3"];
  let posY3 = letterData["Y3"];
  let posX4 = letterData["X4"];
  let posY4 = letterData["Y4"];
    
  let rotR1 = letterData["R1"];
  let rotR2 = letterData["R2"];
  let rotR3 = letterData["R3"];
  let rotR4 = letterData["R4"];
