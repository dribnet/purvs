## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Shenzhen MOCAPE, it basically showing the shapes of different object. The colour of these photos are very clean, is black and white tone.

In this version, I aim to use shape to show the light through the architecture. The artwork 2 is different sketch from Artwotk1 and 3, because i don't think one sketch could showing my concept.
