## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

>This README is a summation of the 5 parts in problem set 1 for MDDN342

### Part 1 | First Faces
The first faces I drew for this project were those of Mario and Luigi of the Nintendo universe. We were told to draw 'Two recognisable faces' and I wanted to make mine two separate but similar faces that were individually recognisable. With a simple color change in the hat, I acheived this differentiation.

### Part 2 | Drawing Styles

I thought my chubby-cheeked Mario looked ver bayish, and I the cutesy style that I had found with my first face. My second drawing became a drooling baby. My baby sparked in me a fascination with age extremes, so I flipped the coin and drew a geriatric man for my final face. I spent a long time tweaking the ranges of the parameters for these faces to make sure the interpolation between extremes was not jarring; this made part 4 (distribution) a lot easier. 

### Part 3 & 4 | Randomisation + Distribution

Moving from sliders to generated faces was a simple transition. I had already spent time curating a parameter range in part 2, and implementing Tom's code was fairly straight forward. Since I got to eliminate two drawing styles with these stages, there was a good deal of releif in paring the sketch file down by about 40%

### Part 5 | Final

Having creative freedom with the layout of the final face population was a lot of fun. I opted for a radial design, 14 disembodied heads floating around an almighty aged leader. I imagined a cult of old heads the whole time I was coding this. Laughs were had.
