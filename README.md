## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My chosen theme is looking at what life was like during lockdown with my flatmates.
Looking at how we kept busy but also focusing on how difficult it was.


I want to take a sort of psychedelic approach to the editing of the photos in the custom pixel, which i feels represents the sort of emotions me and my flatmates were feeling, as we began to go a little crazy in our flat as the days went by. I also feel this psychedelic colour scheme works well with a billboard as the colours reflect vibrant and eye-catching.

Uploading actual photos i've taken today for editing.
