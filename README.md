## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this commit i used the smart masks to generate my masks for my images and decided to use animals as my images. I made this choice because i wanted to see how well the smartmask did and picking animals. I also wanted to predominantly work on my code. 

My theme for this project is the things that first inspired me to do design and move on from being a chef and that is street art, not necessarily graffiti but in Napier they have a few big murals that people have created around the town and i always found them really inspiring and wanting to draw and create things after seeing them. 

In my code i have used these star like lines, these are inspired from a randomgaussian example shown in p5js and adapted to fit my code, i choose this because i wanted to follow more with what inspired me and when i was younger i liked doing these crayon scratch paintings where you would draw in colour on a piece of paper and paint over the colouring with black paint, it created a cool effect and this was the idea behind the stars and using the stroke to my advantage by making it the colour of the picture.
