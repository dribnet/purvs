My typeface was called "NEONVOLT" as it reflects t

My typeface consists of a geometric custom shape that morphs and adapts to create unqiue letterforms. The custom shape uses many of the parameters to manipulate the location of each vertices. The remaining parameters are used to translate and maniuplate the overall shape for both the blue and orange. Using two versions of the custom shape i am able to complete complicated letterforms with fewer variables.

The inspiration 


Animation

The intention for the interpolation between letterforms was to take advantage of the singular shape design and how the forms can naturally morph between each other. The goal was to make an almost organic flow which creates an interesting juxtapostion with the geomtric design.
