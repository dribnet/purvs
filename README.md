## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process 2:

Yesterday, I have finished my first and second pictures. So my second picture is taken last year when I was in Queenstown. I saw a person playing a piano but the type of piano is different compared to my first picture. The first one is more classical, while the second one looks ordinary but parts of the piano is unique. For the masking part, I have masked it with 5 gradients, which are 0, 60, 140, 200 and 255. The gradient 0 is the street in the picture, for its pixel, I have used the combination square shape with fill and rectangle shape with only stroke to show it. The building with the gradient 60 is filled with square shapes with stroke but no fill. Besides that, the piano with the gradient 140 is filled with small rectangles without fill. The boxes on the floor has 200 gradient, I have used ellipses to fill it. Lastly, The person playing piano has the gradient of 255, it has filled with lines. Overall, I really like the pixels for the street which has used the combination of the sqaures with fill and rectangles with only stroke.
