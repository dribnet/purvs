## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos I have taken myself of my dog as a puppy. The mask highlights the entirety of the dog. I also have a second mask that highlights the deg of the dog. I want to show a theme that relates to the negative imapcts of designer dogs and puppy farming that occurs in this country. This design uses a wide range of dog glypths to show the idea of designer dogs and have the actual dog in the photo to be a silhouette.

So far, the algorithm uses my glyph design from the last project to do the background. I have altered it so that the dog ears come in two variations; pointy or floppy. I have also changed the colouring so the dog is all one colour and the colour of the dog matches the original pixel underneath. I also decided to have a consistent rectangle colour and add an outline. 
The silhouette is created using transparent ellipses. I did this because otherwise it looks quite blocky and I like that it makes the silhouette look a bit more undefined. To improve on this algorithm, I added a second mask which keeps sampling random pixels until it ends up in the second mask. I did this to make it easier to control how many ellipses will be seen.
