## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Iteration:
Still trying to figure out what images to use for a final so i've still making different iterations of my images and selecting the best ones.

I took a picture of some rocks that were exposed from the low tide.
Photography-wise:
I wanted to capture the vibrancy of the green vegetation that was growing on the rock and to try and capture the ocean behind it but since the water is so shallow it was a brown colour and when rendered its colours were too similar the wall. So it merged in with it.

Masking/Technical:
 I applied the mask in a way to capture the main focal point of the image which is the rock and all the specular details of the vegetation. Again playing around with the parameters using a strokeweight of 0.9 > 2 for inside the mask and 0.1 > 0.6 for outside the mask in the iterations. Different rendering times again. For the last image however I used points instead of lines so it created a dotted line effect instead of straight lines it created more of a noise effect since the 'lines' are disconnected.

 Do not believe I will consider this image in my finals as there is too much of a disparity between the image renders and my narrative but I have now remembered to try and use points instead of lines.
