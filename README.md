## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
This is the out put of my images using the smart mask tool. I think i will use my own mask as the smart mask just covers the basic details of the image, whereas i can control where i want to mask etc to create more depth to my overall images. the smart mask doesnt pick up on the different clothing layers which i found interesting to play around with when i was making my own mask in illustrator.
