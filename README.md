## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I've now adjusted my hatching lines so that they are no longer as transparent as the blurred background of the paint blobs. All three images are showing a cohesive style which I'm very pleased about. Its demonstrating the abstract look as well especially with the blurred background colour against the harsh bold hatched lines. I want to start experimenting more with the slinky mask as I think this can be the more prominent piece out of the 3. At this stage though, im pleased with image 1 and 2 as they both demonstrate my theme and communicate my idea well.
