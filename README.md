My initial iead was to use sectors to design letters.
In this sketch, one sector has fixed size 100 and another has variational size. One sector has stroke and another without stroke. I think it will contribute to share the similar element and make difference between letters.

coding:  posx,posy,pos2x,pos2y contorl the position of the shapes. aecE,arcE,arcS2,arcE2 control the angle of the sectors.

color use: bright backgroud and dark letters
