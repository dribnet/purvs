## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I am working on making mutliple colours in my mask, I have tired to use my understanding from problem set one however this has been unsuccessful. I think I most likely have the < and > the wrong way around. However I have finished my rough mask for output one, Next step will be to create one for input 3 then I have a pretty solid base to work with


The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
