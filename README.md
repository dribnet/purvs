## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I fixed up a few of the letters as I noticed they weren't all the same size, which gave a messier look than I was intending. I picked out some words, I wanted them to reflect the fun, bright idea that I was aiming for. I did experiment with a lemonade colour scheme but I wasn't a fan

I named my font 'Candypie', it's a gentle name that is bursting with colour and flavour. This reflects my font very well.

The parameters per letter:
  offsetx - the x offset of the letter components
  offsety - the y offset of the letter components
  triangleX1 - first x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY1 - first y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX2 - second x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY2 - second y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX3 - third x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY3 - third y co-ordinate of the triangle
  arcSizeX - arc length on the x axis
  arcSizeY - arc length on the y axis
  arcStart - beginning of the arc in degrees
  arcEnd - end of the arc in degrees
