My idea is based off of Signs from The Witcher series. Each of the signs are a triangle shape. So Im trying to make my letters look like some sort of triangle moprh.

I have finished making the alphabet. I might make small little design changes but mainly im focusing on the look now such as colours etc. 
I also need to take a look at the tranistions and hwo I can make them more interesting.
