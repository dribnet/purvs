## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Part 1 - Initial Ideas

I decided to go with a simple lined font. It only uses straight lines that make up the letters.
Ive come up with a general rule that each letter is to have 3 lines making up the majority of the letter with a fourth to be used as an embellishment. This fourth line can also be incorperated into the main letter in the case of letters such as W.
