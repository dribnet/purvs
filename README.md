## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Last big update, So I added 2 more layers to the mask, one to show skin and the other to show hair. I did this because having the hair and skin the same texture as the clothes looked quite weird and I didnt like it so I changed the hair to have a more ruggard line look and the face to be pixellated. This brings be to the background where it had the pixels with the dots in the middle, I changed that to be twice the size and on a 40 degree angle, I did this so it looked different from the skin and it makes a cool diaginal effect by soing so. The clothes have 5 see through circles representing the colours with a black background to each individual pixel, I did this because it highlights the colours and makes the clothes stand out more. The fur/hair pixels have been made into arcs different sizes to give the effect of hair and it looks quite natural. And lastly the greenery, That was kept the same because I think it looks good and shows nature very nicely with its randomness of green colours that make the artwork look clean but ruggard at the same time.

These pixes relate to my original idea of people in nature because now the people are more detailed and you can tell its a person. All of the people are neat and orginaized and the nature is all random and different to the people to contrast to show that the main focus is the people and the secondry focus of them in nature is the second focus as it is more random and less detailed.

I chose the pictures to show the contrast between people in nature and I feel like these photos do that. I took all of the photos for the reference, and they all represent people in nature.

Disclamer.
Github is playing up and the README.md is displayed in a weird format. This happened after I transferred my work to the mac for the smartmask and when I transferred the files back it said the file size was too big and now displays the readme like this. The best way to view the readme is on my github page on the raw footage feature.

Final Summary.
The design that was used was made to represent the theme people in nature. There were originally supposed to be 3 layers to a mask but that changed to 5 due to the clothes pattern not suiting the skin and hair on the people and I wanted the people to be more detailed to show the people aspect to the design. The people pixels are all ordered and neat to represent man made objects which normally they are symmetrical and planned while the nature pixels used are random and jumbled to show what nature is like. The thing I liked the most in my design was the clothes pixel, I thought it was the best design for the pixel because even though most of it is black it shows colour and tone the best out of all the pixels.
