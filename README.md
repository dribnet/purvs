### Old clock

For my clock idea i am taking inspiratio form clocks from the past. The ideas I have currently revolve around a sundial, wth the sun moving and the time chamgig like that. 
A candle slowly getting smaller, with the wax falling and changing the time as it falls over it.
A grandfather clock with the pendulum swinging.
Or an hourglass with the sand covering the time so it changes.
