## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

26/05/20 - Experimentation 4
The images above are photos of my apartment view processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). 

For this experiment I kept the style of pixels' the same throughtout the 3 photos. The only changes that were made are the images. The photos are taken from my bedroom by the window at different times of the day (evening, night and morning). I wanted to see how the images would look together with the same style but different colouration. 

I did change the masks slightly to suit the angle of the image.
