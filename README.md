## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

At this point I'm still playing with ideas, I quite like the mixture of the grid and the semi randomized grid. I also want to experiment more with the greyscale areas and the overall pixel density. I'm thinking if I change pixel density with different masks the code will need significant refacturing but overall could be worth it; seeing as at this point if the pixel density is to high the saveBlocksImages command crashes.

### Update:

I've now added multiple masks and the ability to use both the fully randomized script and the two grid style scripts in one porject.
