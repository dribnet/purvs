Final

When creating my parameterised map I wanted to carry through the idea of a calm and soothing image through the use of waves and circles which I did in project three. I think I have been able to replicate this quite well even through I struggled figuring out where to start.

I started by drawing the solid wave as it seemed easiest. However, when trying to use quadratic vertices in the new code was challenging. By starting with the solid wave it helped to guide where to place the individual circles. From there I was able to animate the circles so they would pulse and create the visual effect of a wave moving, similar to project three.

Overall, I am happy with the final outcome and even though I struggled a lot with the code I liked being able to figure out how to use it to fit what I wanted to create.
