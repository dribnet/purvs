## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

### 28/04/22 - FEEDBACK

Today, I got some feedback on my design. Hazel liked my design and thought the style I am going for was clear. When I asked about the M, N and W, she said that she didn't think it was a massive issue. She said it was clear enough to read when in context of a word or in the alphabet so I am not as worried about it now.

She also suggested that I could add individual backgrounds to each of my letters to make them look like each letter was on its own canvas. I thought this could look cool so I have tried it and quite like the effect it gives. I still need to play around with the colours and stroke but I think it will suit the project. I also added a little nail and rope above the letter to make it look like the canvas is hanging on a wall (this also still needs some refinement).

The 15 parameters per letter:
  * `numLineSquares` : The number of squares to be drawn in the array
  * `lineSquaresX`: The x position of the square array
  * `lineSquaresY`: The y position of the square array
  * `rectYellowX`: The x position of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectYellowY`: The y position of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectYellowWidth`: The width of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectYellowHeight`: The height of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectRedX`: The x position of the red rectangle
  * `rectRedY`: The y position of the red rectangle
  * `rectRedWidth`: The width of the red rectangle
  * `rectRedHeight`: The height of the red rectangle
  * `square1X`: The x position of one of the first white squares
  * `square1Y`: The y position of the first white square
  * `square2X`: The x position of the second white square
  * `square2Y`: The y position of the second white square

My next steps are to work on making the interpolations between letters nicer. Having the canvas in the background means that I need to make sure no parts of the letters move off the canvas as they change, which is something that is currently happening. I do quite like the way the letters change but I could still make it a bit cleaner.

Phoebe mentioned to me that the Mondrian art movement was heavily influenced by the golden ratio for where each of the squares are positioned. I had not considered this when creating my shapes but I might see if any of the letters use this and try to change some others to use the ratio more.

Overall I am happy with where I am at and I feel that I am on track to finish for hand in next week.
