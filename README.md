## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2
I may have changed my design a few times. I don't know what my design process/inspiration but I just kept experimenting and iterating right up until the very end when I had something I was happy with.
What I had intended to look like a halftone font similar to Tate's logo ended up looking more like a glitchy computer terminal font. I managed to fix it to create that halftone effect, but I decided to stick to the glitchy look. Call it a challenge to find the bugs in my code I left as "features".
The variables are simple, all of the letters are made of dots in a 10x25 grid but really exist within a 4x5 grid. Controlling the letters are 20 (4x5) variables that determine the radius of a chunk in that grid. The smaller circles then trace the shortest distance to one of these circles and whichever chunk is closest and largest will affect that particles diameter. These 20 variables are simple named "chunk#" and are called in an array to save my sanity and yours when typing/reading over code.
I decided to go back to my original colour scheme. It doesn't sense for a glitchy digital font but I was never trying to make that kind of font anyway. A formal monochromatic wouldn't make sense by that logic either (although it does look nice) so I decided to just use an abstract colour scheme that honestly reflects the project as something that is not trying to emulate anything.
