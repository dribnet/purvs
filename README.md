## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is an initial upload with a few random images from my pendrive. For my project, I want to focus on how the abtraction of the images can change not only the shape of things but also the colours. I want to take human subjects and place them in interesting locale with lots of colour then through the render, make those images desaturated and dull.
