## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

 Today is the first time that I start this project. After watching tutorials, I starting to make design of my letters. I decide to make a leter from an arc and a triangle which it's variable could be moved. Now I am trying to make triangle's variables moving by itself. I want to make the triangle's height move by itself.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
