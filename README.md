## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have created a custom pixel that has a touch of circular floral elements while arranging the background pixels in a grid formation so that it remains structured. I have chosen to create masks that highlight the floral subject of the pictures. The circular pixels that make up the flowers contrast with the sparse background which highlights them more. I chose to include the two hands in the middle picture as I think it gives more context when people are viewing it from a further distance.
