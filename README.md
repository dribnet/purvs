## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

This is my first experiment: extending the hex grid code I used in ps3. I liked the kind of tiling that a hex grid allowed for, but wasn't sold on how flat my final product looked in ps3. For inspiration, I printed myself some dot paper from [incompetech](http://incompetech.com/graphpaper/trianglehex.html) and started doodling.
 What I came out with was a classic isometric, stacked cubes design !(https://i.pinimg.com/736x/81/51/a5/8151a5c12ce5a0dbda93d07e00c3a390--parquetry-motifs.jpg).
 I like the dimensionality that this design has, but I dont think it lends itself as well to creating clusters in the way that my mapo generator did.
