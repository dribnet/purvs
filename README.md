## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Looking at oscilloscopes as inspiration now.

Changed the bottom line for I to be shorter to help it look less like an upside down T.

Worked on a capital H again but just went back to the lowercase one.

Added a lerp colour, depending on the peak height it changes from blue to yellow. Blue low height, yellow most height.

I think for the numbers it would be good to do the same but with the amount of peaks instead of height.

Changed the background colour to off black.

Tried changing the stroke cap to round, but I don't think I like it rounded so I changed it back to square.

Letters I don't like:
H - Needs a third wave but want to stick with just having 2 lines
I - same with H
Q - respect its ugliness
U,V - very similar

Todo:
Separate colour map for numbers based on amount of peaks.
