## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

  March 23
  Today in class we got introduced to project two. To start with we made our own A B C letters in a different style.
  When messing with the code I changed a lot of the colours, changed the circles to squares and messed with moving the squares around and changing the sizes.
  For this project I want to create an abstract alphabet.
  Each of my letters is composed of one or two squares, The pink squares are stationary for now but the size and movement of the blue squares is controlled by the three parameters that were originally in the code. I added a fourth and fifth parameter to control a third smaller square within each letter.

  The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : size of the second sqaure
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the pink squares
  * `offsety` : y offset of the pink squares
  * 'offsetx2' : x offset of the green/blue squares
  * 'offsety2' : y offset of the green/blue squares
  * 'smallXPos' : x position of the FIRST dark blue square
  * 'smallYPos' : y position of the FIRST dark blue square
  * 'smallXPos2' : x position of the SECOND dark blue squares
  * 'smallYPos2' : y position of the SECOND dark blue squares

  In class we moved our starting sketch to the draw letters js and the letters js, I spent most of the lesson organising my code and figuring out how to make each aspect move how I want, I also made the pink squares into a variable that I can move how I want rather than it being in the same place between each letter.
