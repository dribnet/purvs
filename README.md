## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment

Having recieved feedback on the Slack design-feedback channel, I have changed the design of letter "w", as compared to the rest, it was asymmetrical. At first, I designed it in a way where it wouldn't be too similar to the letter "u". In addition, this asymmetrical design of the w made it stand out more. I just decided to make the w have 3 lines instead of 2, so it is separated from the letter u, and can also still be symmetrical. 

In addition to this, a tutor pointed out to me that the colours are all too similar and need a bit of contrast. I've decided to keep the light candy pink font colour, and just contrasted that with a mint green background. This really made my letters "pop out" more.
