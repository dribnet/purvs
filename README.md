## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Sketch

I've picked an idea to develop for my final. Each letter will be drawn using a number of hexagons (6 - 10?).
I'm thinking some letters will be uppercase and some lowercase.

I made a function that draws a hexagon. When called, the function that draws the hexagon draws it at a specified x position and y position on the canvas which will be my parameters.
For my sketch, I just called the function and manually typed in coordinates for each of the hexagons. I will use the correct number of parameters in my alphabet/interaction/exhibition.

The two parameters per letter:
  * `hex1_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
  * `hex1_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
