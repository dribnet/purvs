## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

UPDATE:
I have used different pass layers and added grey to my masks to add a colourblocked bit on parts of my pictures. 

I've been experimenting with the grid techniques we've covered in class. At the moment I am not using the masks really as I'm trying to work out how I want my images to look overall. I have changed my photos to ones I've taken of natural environments as I really like how the colours complement each other. Ideally I would like to communicate a message to do with being aware of the impact we have on our environment/ sustainability and not to take these things for granted.
