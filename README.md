## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

idea: a space inspired design where a planet and a moon going infornt of the sun creates negetive space to that you can see the rough outline of a letter.

today I got the hang of sin waves, benier curves, and making circular shapes out of sin waves. The practise sin wave circle I did kinda reminded me of a starburst, so I decided to lean more into that thn the ocean inspired one I had started researching the curves for. I think my design is a lot more interesting now.

My next steps will be adding some little stars in the background, and working out how to fit my arc into the theme - I thought it could possibly be a shooting star or something like that but I'm still working on making the star actually look like a star. I think I'll also make it a bit darker to that it's more obvious that it's supposed to be negetive space.
