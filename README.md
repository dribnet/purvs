## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme:
My overall theme for these images is space and astrophotography. I chose this because outside of Uni and Work, my hobby is to take images of space such as Nebulae and Galaxies. I think it would be cool to use my images because these objects in space all have wildly different shapes, sizes and most importantly colors.

Changelog:
I have switched the star shapes to be inside the mask. This change was because they are quite detailed shapes and when they are smaller they have a really cool effect, I think it would be better to have them inside the mask as that is where I want the viewers focus to be on. For the shapes outside of the mask I have made them rectangles. I want the outer shapes to be simple and a lower pixel count as I dont want it to take away from the main subject of the image. I think the dashed lines makes for a cool warping effect, although I may tweak this in future. One thing I for sure want to change is the mask on image 1, I think it leaves too much of the nebula out of the mask and low res, which is where I want to focus to be, so I will edit its mask and make it fit the entire red coloring in and see what it looks like.
