## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I fixed the problems of the ellipses drawing over the hexagons and the bee. I did this by only drawing the hexagons and bee after a certain number of ellipses had been draw. I had to make another render counter (as well as x and y variables) that only started after that point because the hexagons started partway down the screen which I didn't want.

I also changed the ellipses y value from *0.5 to -300 so instead of the image in the background being squashed it's now moved up. I also made the ellipses slightly bigger to better see the background image.

I like how the bee isn't that noticeable in the image. The hidden bee on the blooming flowers represents how bees are always there, pollenating flowers even if you don't see them.
