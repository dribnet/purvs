## Final

This is my final version of the clock. My clock for the most part follows a minimalistic look, with the primitive shapes such as circles and lines, as well at first glance it looks mostly black and white apart from the millisecond hand.
When the alarm is counting down this is shown by the circles turning red in order from the most outer the most inner. While the alarm is going off it's shown by various coloured circles shrinking and expanding. I chose to try and make this a smooth looking animation so that it did not look out of place from the rest of the theme.

Overall I'm happy with how my clock turned out. I feel I gave it a simple look without it becoming boring.
