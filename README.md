## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

My alphabet is inspired by James Edmondson's work (dedicated typographer) and it is a monochromatic, kinetic rectangle and two ellipses that vary from 2 different sizes. 

The typeface is inspired by mechanical fonts and I feel having a simple, high contrast colorway being dark and light would be essential to convey this.

The rects were hard to work with as each point had to be iterated to create a new shape. The ellipses on the other hand was naturally easy as it only has size and position parameters.

Overall my interpretation of my precedent is a bolder one as I felt having the 'mechanic' look is ideal.
