I have done some training on my faces. Some are identifiable. However, I did the quiz and I found it quite difficult. Which is a pity because the training took so long. I think I need try make the variables more obvious. At the moment I am trying to map the hair colour to the whole fire body colour. That is confusing me because sometimes when I train it I fieel like I need to map the skin colour to the fire body colour. I need more clarity.
