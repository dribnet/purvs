For the portraits I was just getting use to Javascript and started off easy by creating Morty, hich consists of pretty simple shapes. For spongebob I started trying more difficult things: I used a loop to create his curvy body, and curves for his mouth and cheeks. I had to be careful with layering for both faces.

For my drawing styles I brough over Morty and Spongebob from my previous work and did Batman for my third. I feel each of my three faces are quite different and offered me a good choice for which style to take further. I really liked the stlye of the Batman face (using beginShape() to draw all the face verteices) but in the end I felt Spongebob would offer the best parametric features. 

For the randomizing I took Spongebob and added some eyebrows to him to add some more facial expression and feel it brings a lot of variety to the faces. It was quite difficult to remove clipping on the eyes but I think I've hidden it well. 

For the distribution I wanted to get it so every face looks different enough to those around it, and feel I've achieved that. I made it so bodies with only one curve on them are rare as are bodies with 2 curves, so most of the bodies look like spongebobs actual body. I did this with the holes as well so getting a plain spongebob is rare and will stand out.

For my final design I decided to zoom out and show lots of spongebob faces as I think it looks quite nice and still showcases the variety in all their expressions. I also made it able to zoom in when randomizing the faces just to show off the details better. 

Left clicking changes zoom level and generates new faces, while the faces change by themselves every 5 seconds but the zoom level doesn't.
