After the class crit session, I got a good piece of advice to make some lines thicker than others. What this does it makes it many times easier to read as well as making it not look as cluttered. This way the same amount of information is on the page but less space is being taken up.

After completing my alphabet I realised that if I had not figured this out it would be very difficult to recognise certain letters a part from others if they were all the same line thickness.
For example: 
N,8 and X
E, F and H

Doing this also helps with the constellation look that I was going for with my letters. Since often with constellation maps they will have certain more important lines, symbols and circles larger than others.
