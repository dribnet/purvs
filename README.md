### Pill Clock Alarm

This pill container clock is inspried by my grandma since she always forgot to have her medicine. I added the pill container design as I want to incorporate the AM and PM display aspect. I think this design has shown this aspect pretty well by changing the location of the pills to different columns of the pill container. 

I was going to code the alarm function in a crazier way for example having a lot of capsules falling down but instead I dedcided to make a more subtle alarm with just colour changes of the seconds animation and having the empty heart leveling up animation. Initially, I coded the pills in the AM/PM section in a more pastel colour palette to match my overall design but I ended up using the bright red and yellow since it actually looks like actual pills the most. I added the playful heart leveling up animation to make my clock looks cuter and funner.
