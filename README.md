i like the colours in the palette,, but they dont really work with this design. and i definitely dont like how the background is so bright. the letters look better in alphabet.html without the background colour change. 
I think i will try to go for something, brighter (less pastel) and more similar (maybe a colourful gradient). I liked how they looked in the blue monochrome, so that might be the best way to go. With the monochrome it was easier for your eyes to make out the letter because it started out the darkest and then got lighter. I'll play around see if i can achieve a similar thing.
