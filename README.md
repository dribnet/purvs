### Updating towards Final

In the last commit I updated my work to be able to use the debug.

Now i'm starting to progress towards my final. Going to try use  polar to cartesian conversion to have my slit scan rotate around the canvas instead of making lines. Just need to remember how to incorporate the video sketch into the clock sketch.
