This is my final Alphabet. To create my alphabet I used a base of three triangles. Each letter or number consists of two to three triangles. I made the rule that each letter or number must have one darker coloured triangle. The other one or two triangles are the same colour.
I did this to help keep all the numbers and letters looking like they are from the same font.
Another rule I created for myself is that if a letter or number has a cut out within it then the darker triangle will be used to represent this. It would also be used to help show a cut out of  the side of a shape, by slightly overlapping the base shape to form a letter or number. I also made rules as for when there should  be cross overs with shapes. One being that if two triangles are symmetrical, they must overlap. Another being if two sides of a triangles can touch, then the triangle that isn’t the base of the form must overlap to touch the next available side of the other triangle. The only time they can’t overlap is when a point is touching the side of triangle. Overall this is mostly the basic rules I used to keep my whole alphabet consistent.

Parameters per letter:

AV1x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle A.
AV1y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle A.
AV2x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle A.
AV2y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle A.
AV3x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle A.
AV3y : y position of vertex 3 on triangle A.
BV1x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle B.
BV1y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle B.
BV2x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle B.
BV2y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle B.
BV3x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle B.
