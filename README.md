### The concept of clock

I just want to show my concept of my clock. I was inspired by the traditional philosophy. That means the time is equitable for anyone so that it keeps the balance in the world. I just want to give the sense of constract to show the balance.
 when the inside circle rotate, it pour the white or black into the outside circle.
 That's just a rough idea.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your 
image above. You can also include
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
