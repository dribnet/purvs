REFINED DISTRIBUTION

I had a play around with the focus and directing my parameters towards more likely average values with differennt focuses. In the end these are the changes I have made to my focusedRandom() functions on the different variables.

Face 1:
On face one(panda) I focused the scale to a larger average size (75%) with a stronger focus to draw atttention as I think it is my favourite face and I want the detail to be clear. I focused the smile towards the lower end of the curve value as I wanted them to be more smiley overall. I also made it more likely for the bears to have red blush as I like the colour agains the otherwise more natural colours. I left the ears alone as I want that to be more random as I quite like all the different options for this face.

Face 2:
I made this face more likeley to have ear style one (spikey fur in the middle) as I like it the best and I also made the average mouth size in the middle but I didn't make the focus too high as I still wanted to allow for different sizes. I also made the average scale slightly smaller than face1 at 65% but I allowed for more variability as I didnt want their to be no change in scale.

Face 3:
This face has the smallest scale average at 60% but again not as focused as face 1 to allow for size chnge. I focused the ears towards an average between style 1 and two as they were my favourites but I didnt make the focus too intense as I wanted the other style to occur and found that it didnt really with any higher focus. I also averaged the mouth towards an average size but without crazy high focus.
