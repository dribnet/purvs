## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Having completed the alphabet I can now move onto 1-10 ,this step should be fairly easy. Another thing I could improve on as well is the M and W, I couldn't think of a better way to do these with 4 control points. I also added a mapp to the color which now changes depending on the location of the control points.
I also had some issues with the interpolation which I will have to trouble shoot next class. 


The eight parameters per letter:
	* 'posx1' : X starting point of bezier
	* 'posy1' : Y starting point of bezier
	* 'posx2' : Second X point of bezier
	* 'posy2' : Second Y point of bezier
	* 'posx3' : Third X point of bezier
	* 'posy3' : Third Y point of bezier
	* 'posx4' : Last X point of bezier
	* 'posy4' : Last Y point of bezier
