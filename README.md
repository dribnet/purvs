Ive tidied up and shrunk the T, ive also done the same with the i. I had to compromise and use an upper case T because i could create a decent tranisition for a lower case.

The current parameters are:

* `Line1` :  Whether this line is visable and/or curved

* `Line2` : Whether this line is visable and/or curved

* `Line3` : Whether this line is visable and/or curved

* `Line4` : Whether this line is visable and/or curved

* `Line5` : Whether this line is visable and/or curved

* `Line6` : Whether this line is visable and/or curved

* `Line7` : Whether this line is visable and/or curved

* `Horizontal` : True or false, if true the entire grid is rotated 90 degrees sideways.

* `Scale` : The vertical height of the letter

* `Offset` : The y position offset
