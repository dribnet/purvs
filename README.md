I looked at altering the designs of the letters f, i, j, r and s, as well as the number nine. For the letters, I decided to adjust them slightly, as I felt that they sat too close to the median line in comparison to other letters, which sat quite low beneath it. For the f, I decided to keep it as is for now, as I saw that alterante designs did not represent the f in an overt manner compared to my original design. For the number nine, I initially thought I should have it mirror the design of the number six, since they traditionally resemble eachother when flipped. I also realized that nine had another form, and so to remain cohesive in design, I altered the nine to its current form. I am much more satisfied with my letter and number forms as a whole.

The fourteen parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
