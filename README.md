## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Finally, a complete project. Not without its efforts. This project had a rocky start due to the idea switch I had over halfway through. The original idea had no ground in this project due to the overly simplistic look. Hence I had to change to the font I have now. This font would draw from a strange mix of Bauhaus and pseudo Memphis eras of design, the simplistic but varied geometry in the lettering being a reflection of this.

The main problem I had with this project was the syncing of the sizing and offset positions. Shuffling these around and rewriting a lot of the code was annoying but way easier to organise and make letters from that better formed code. I was lucky that the editor wasn't entirely needed for starting to create the alphabet so I could get a few letters to get a preview before I continued.

Once I had the editor set up, the alphabet creating was simple. I was able to do a lot without it, but with letters like K or X, I used the editor to create these shapes as they do not fully fit with my alphabet. The alphabet creation besides this was fairly straightforward and I got the alphabet done quite quickly.

For the interpolation, I wanted there to be a 'mid point' of sorts so that the transitions between letters would return to default before shaping the next letter. This would show the harmony and difference in each character effectively as well as appear smoother in terms of transition between each letter. A weird but interesting result of this mid point meant that when it reaches the mid point, the letter appears to fade slightly before returning to screen. I thought about how to change this, but decided it fit with the dynamic of the font.

Now with a full alphabet and interaction, I formatted the HTML files to compliment the letterform.
