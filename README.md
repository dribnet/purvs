## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

FONT: Geometric Funhouse


My alphabet gets more complex has it goes on, the letters/numbers become more an more abstract but even so when together they form a fairly functional alphabet, but alone they provoke the eye.

Often typography is brushed to the side and seen as more of a requirement is design, rather than an assest. Typography has deep roots in design, and changes era by era, with the trends. In my design I wanted to acknowledge the fun pops of colour and geometric design of the 80's and the mixed varation of stroke and width size of art deco.

Played with alphabet and added D, next I want to add another rect ti my design so I can more clearly distingush the letters from each other.

Also setting up the code on my laptop.

20/04
Decided to change my theme for my alphabet
Playing around with adding more parimeters
wanting to create illusion of negative space for some letters by making them the same colour as the background


22/04

I've been playing around wih transparency (I stlll want this shape to still be yellow)
Also added two more parimeters
I've now done up to letter L

26/04 

code is now uploading to git from my own computer, for some reason I had two ps2 folders!

I finshed my alphabet, I'm not just going to further refine my design and work on transitions.

experimented with a new colour palette + tweaked letters

quite like this palette

My alphabet gets more complex has it goes on, the letters/numbers become more an more abstract but even so when together they form a fairly functional alphabet, but alone they provoke the eye.

 - also need to make sure all of my letters fit into their bounding box
