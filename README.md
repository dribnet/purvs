## PS2 MDDN 242 2018
I wanted to play around with the colour, stroke and transparency. For this design I wanted to try using bright colours. I swapped out the black of the previous design for a pink/red. The stroke is not white, instead it is a very light pink. I did this to make it more cohesive with the overall colour scheme. I made the stroke of the smaller circle thinner than the stroke of the line and bigger circle, so they would stand out a little more.

The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
