## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

- - - Forgot to change the preview and thumbnail images for previous commit - - -

(Below is the same description as previous commit)

Theme: Pasifika Identity in Aotearoa New Zealand. 

I re-masked all the images with a Samoan flower in the back. This flower of which is on my tattoo. I creates a nice contrast between the subject and the background but I will look in to maybe adding colour, changing the greyscale a bit.

I think this third image will be my final third image because I wanted to create a compare and contrast between the "old school" and the "new school".

What I will do next: Look at adding colour and transparency. Adjusting the colour tones and balancing them out.
