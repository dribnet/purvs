## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

At this stage I don't have an overall theme but it will possibly be sunrise, day time then sunset. 

My first image is taken in the car park at the Kelburn campus at 7:00am. The second picture is of my brother walking on the beach in Cathedral Cove. My third image is of graffiti in an alleyway on the way to Courtney Place. 

Today I was experimenting with the first image by wanting to create a soft contrast between the land and clouds with the sky and ocean. I made the overall image have horizontally stretched out shapes so there was a general movement in the overall composition, then I broke this movement but placing vertically stretched shapes. I quite liked the dripping look.

For my second image since there is a sharp contrast between my brothers shadow and the beach I wanted to play with contrasting forms. I like how the ellipses I used on the shadow cut through the vertical shapes because it looks like particles are coming off of him.

My last picture had a lot of colours coming off of it that I wanted to make pop out from the wall, so I stretched out ellipses vertically and horizontally out from the wall.
