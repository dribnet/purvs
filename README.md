Each of my letters is composed of a grid of nine circles and a diamond, square and circle to indicate angles lines and curves.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The 12 parameters per letter:
  TL, TM, TR, ML, MM, MR, BL, BM, BR : controls the circle grid 
  "Square": controls the square
  "Circle": controls the circle
  "Triangle": controls the two triangles

  Refactored control variables for readability
  changed the diamond to two triangles because the cross effect was more versatile
