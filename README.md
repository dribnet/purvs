## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
the theme is Halloween in school, when I was high school student in Auckland, my teachers put on thier halloween clothes in school, so I take some photo for them, which I think is really interesting, so I used those photos for this project.

I used smarmask to make the mask for each images, and I changed the shpaes of the pixels.
