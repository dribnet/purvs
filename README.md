BEE HUANG PROJECT 2: Parametric	Alphabet FINAL

|FINAL ALPHABET
This is the final design of my font called 'Vampires'.

|PARAMETERS & DESIGN
The 14 parameters per letter:
 • "offsetx": 17, | x position for first rect (white fill)
 • "offsety": 0, | y position for first rect (white fill)
 • "rectlength": 28, | first rect length (white fill)
 • "rectheight": 90, | first rect height (white fill)
 • "nofill_length": 20, | second rect length (red stroke)
 • "nofill_height": 82, | second rect height (red stroke)
 • "rect_twoposx": 55,  | x position for second rect (red stroke)
 • "rect_twoposy": 4, | y position for second rect (red stroke)
 • "triangleleftx": 188, | triangle first point for x
 • "trianglelefty": 270, | triangle first point for y
 • "triangletopx": 228, | triangle second point for x
 • "triangletopy": 198, | triangle second point for y
 • "trianglerightx": 266, | triangle third point for x
 • "trianglerighty": 270, | triangle third point for y

My alphabet consists of two rectangles and one triangle. I really wanted to work with opacity and negative space in this project to keep to simple yet effective because in my other projects (including previous years) I've always done a lot of detailing.
The triangle is the only shape I applied opacity to because it is drawn on top of the two rectangles. The opacity successfully creates contrast when it overlaps with the rectangles because it creates the illusion of a shadow. I also made the triangle have the same fill colour as the background so it would create negative space within the letters as it cuts out the middle making holes. As you can see all the effects are created by my triangle and the rectangles compliment it. In saying this I purposely chose to include a triangle because it is a sharp shape that produces the most tension visually and it is fitting for my theme.

The red and white colour scheme is chosen to suit my vampire, supernatural and dark theme. The colours are almost at their highest (/brightest) values because they stand out the most in the dark background.

|READABILITY
My alphabet is not supposed to be 100% readable because I would like to think this alphabet is a modern redesign for vampires. It takes inspiraion from our current alphbet while including more edgy and medieval forms so they could carve these letters into their furniture or rings.  

|REFLECTION
In this project I took a different approach than I usually would. I wanted to get a hold of 'less is more' espcially in this project because we were limited to a maximum of 20 parameters. I found the type me, type me not interactive facinating because the coder was able to create some cool fonts with limited parameters so I wanted to do the same! When I started on the sketch.js
I was afraid that I would have too many parameters but to my surprise I only had 14 which is pretty good but seemed like a lot just for 3 shapes. In my very first sketch you can see that I wanted to go with a more cubic and fun alphabet but that quickly changed because I am more interested in creepy things and I like to express my interests in my designs.

I am most proud of my code efficiency this time round because I didn't code in lots of detail this time, just kept it simple with shapes and limited variables. I am surprised that so little code can produce something
awesome.

The one minor thing I could improve on is possibly the consistency of the letter as it should follow the rule of: mostly red, smaller amounts of white and triangle that overlaps. What I mean by this is if you look at the number 6, this is the only symbol in the alphabet that has a more obvious white square because 1. it is bigger and 2. the red rect is on top of it. If you look at the letters O, 0 and possibly M they all have a  more noticable triangle overlap, it can especially be seen in my exhibtion in the word 'immortal' - the top point of the triangle is in the middle of the white rect which creates a unique effect. I still liked the letters
and it looks fine when you look at the entire alphabet as one but if you look at the singular letter or number you can see that it is slightly different.

I am quite happy with the outcome of my alphabet, I definitely enjoyed this project a lot more than I thought I did because reading the brief, listening to the tasks and requirements I wasn't tooexcited to start on it, however, it was super cool designing each individual letter to your liking using the editor.js (shout out for implementing that for us to use!!). I also learned to control the amount of variables I have in my code which reduced the time I had to spend changing each variable which was great because this means more time designing and refining :).
