## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I added a fill on the second pattern from level 6 to give a bit more colour variation in the background as it was looking flat. 

The progression is now as follows:

0. original pattern
1. dark diamond added
2. diamond is lightened, inner lines of main pattern is added.
3. diamond is lightened again
4. second pattern is added
5. Ellipses are added faintly
6. orange outer line appears, ellipses get darker, fill enabled.
7. ellipses appear the same colour as the original background, orange outer lines get thicker


My next step is to get some ambient animation going, and deciding how i want my zoom levels to "finish". I worry any more levels will become too laggy to function once I add animations, so I may have to keep it simple.
