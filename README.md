## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images I used for todays experiment are of graffiti around Wellington. I am still trying to come up with a meaningful theme but for now I am just experimenting with the code.

The output I came up with today was sort of an accident - I drew a line but didn't change the second x and y positions so they are all drawing to one point. I actually like how this turned out and I think it's interesting how it pulls the colours out.
