## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

This update focuses on the exhibition page and trialling different colour combinations. THe set I liked the most is the one shown here with a citrus kind of colour scheme to it. The letters are made of a toned down lemon and orange whilst the background is a minty lime. I'm still unsure about the line weights in this design. I've trialled a few different line weights but is seems having them consisntent across the letters is definitley best, and maybe not having them at all looks cleaner, but this is my favourite setting for now.

The drawing of the triangles has now been put in a function! This saves on lines of code and makes it easy to adjust the amount of triangles should I need more or less as just the function needs to be called and passed a handfull of variables.

the parameters per letter are:
Main triangle
  - rotate1B
  - stroke1Big
first small triangle
  - offset1Smallx
  - offset1Smally
  - rotate1S
  - stroke1Small
second small triangle
  - offset2Smallx
  - offset2Smally
  - rotate2S
