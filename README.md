## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My theme is influenced by my relationship with old sentimental toys when growing up as a child. I’ve always loved expressing my creativity as a child and the best way I could achieve this was through building enormous structures out of lego, solving rubiks cubes and exploring ways to create things. Communicating this theme through colour and abstraction was always my goal when creating my images. I really wanted the canvas to burst with colour and highlight the key subjects on the screen. Using the hatching technique and draw paint blob I have been able to generate a dynamic custom pixel to emphasise the shape and form of the toys.  Adjusting my masks and the variables was a process that developed the more commits I made, I came to a point where the design decisions I made reflected positively on the screen and decided that I could finally leave it. After introducing the blur effect in, I felt like I really created emphasis on the toys by blurring the background out and making the colours of the objects pop. This will reflect nicely on a billboard as those are all qualities that people expect to see – something that s stands out. 
Bringing these images to life is really important to me as I resonate with the images and perhaps other people will too. They are playful and fun to look at which is what everyone deserves to see when walking down Willis St.
