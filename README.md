   The idea of this concept is from the audio pitch. 
   The yellow arc show the level of pitch.
   For example the A tone is lower tha C tone, 
   the arc of A is more smooth than the arc of C.
   
   x,y2 and x5,y5 control the blue arc
   x2,y3 and x6,y6 control the filled arc
   x3,2y and x7,y7 control the green arc

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
