## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

Today I refined my alphabet a bit more and continued developing more letters.

For the gaps between in between lines I decided to use a quad that is backgrund coloured to cover uwnanted lines. This added 8 parameters but this is fine because now we can use up to 20.

The c and e look quite similar right now so might have to work on this but so far I think it is going well.

I don't want my alphabet to be too simple so I might add some details later as well as make an interesting animation for the switch between letters.

The twelve parameters per letter:
  * `Yshift1` : top of line position for first line
  * `Yshift2` : top of line position for second line
  * `Yshift3` : top of line position for third line
  * `Yshift4` : top of line position for fourth line   

  * `length1` : length bottom of line position for first line
  * `length2` : length bottom of line position for second line
  * `length3` : length bottom of line position for third line
  * `length4` : length bottom of line position for fourth line


  * `Xquad1` : x position of first quad point
  * `Xquad2` : x position of second quad point
  * `Xquad3` : x position of third quad point
  * `Xquad4` : x position of fourth quad point

  * `Yquad1` : y position of first quad point
  * `Yquad2` : y position of second quad point
  * `Yquad3` : y position of third quad point
  * `Yquad4` : y position of fourth quad point
