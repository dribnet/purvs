Updating before implementing the final section of code. I realised before I stated my offsets incorrectly, this is what they should be:

  "offset1": triangle 1 x, line 1 and 2 x
  "offset2": triangle 1 y, line 1 and 2 y
  "offset3": triangle 2 x, line 3 x
  "offset4": triangle 2 y, line 3 y
  "rotate1": triangle 1 line 1 and 2 rotation
  "rotate2": triangle 2 line 3 rotation

I have completed the final letters I was missing. I still need to set the parameters for the numbers, but I am implementing the last section of code while still in class just incase it doesn't go smoothly. After I've done those two things I will do a final tidy up of the alphabet and fine tune the animation.
