## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Finally finished an dfinalised the colours, I went with a basic Black and White layout as it makes the smaller parts stand out easier against the constant white circle. I am very pleased with how I have done throughout this project.

I do realise that the sketch for the other examples of colours still show the base colours, however the alphaebt interaction etc still work as planned

I chpse to think of the letters and their defining features of shape and flow, and represent them as best I can whilst still maintaining a somewhat readable alphabet. It was a tricky assignment as I cant say Ive had to recreate an alphabet using shapes before, so t was an interesting learning curve but one that I enjoyed.



The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  'start' : First angle for my arc
  'stop' : Second angle for my arc
