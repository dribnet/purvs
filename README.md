## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

From the first exercise I spent a lot of effort into creating Zamasu, a character from dragon ball super. I took a reference image and went into photoshop, attempting to break down his face into basic shapes. In the end It involved a large amount of quads and triangles to get the shapes correct, but I was very happy with the result and how it looked in a clean and simplified version.

When I moved on to the second part of the problem set and was exploring parameterised values assigned to sliders, I found that my other two faces seemed to have a limited amount of room I could explore with, but with Zamasu’s face I was already thinking about different ways I could assign new values with more sliders.

Part 3 of this assignment is where I spent most of my time working. I created a very large amount of parameterised values to randomised with, and create different kai’s faces with (Kai is the species of person Zamasu was). There were many regular values with short ranges used for the facial features, and many discrete values used for the hair and earrings. In the end I feel like I accomplished creating a variety of faces that could all be identified as Kai’s or Supreme Kai’s, and they each had a unique expression showing an emotion such as anger, or happiness in various intensities. 

For the distribution segment of the project, I wanted to focus on making sure the key identifiable factors of a Supreme Kai were present in most faces. This including making sure the ear shapes are always within a reasonable range, maintaining the sharpness of the jawline, and making sure that the earrings are mostly populated on both ears amongst the faces.

The challenge for the final part of the project was thinking of a good way to organise and show the faces. I decided to finish up on the clean aesthetic I was building throughout the project with the layout. The first step was organising the faces with their colours as it was a bit distracting having so many different face colours show up at once. I toned back how random the colour values were and controlled them to change gradually with each drawn face. The lighter colours will always be on the bottom right, and the darker colours will be on the top left. 

I experimented with setting the faces slightly off on the x axis, but it did not fit the clean design I was aiming for. The standard grid worked great for this by default. As the face design had many colours, I thought solid colours should be used for the background aswell, I separated the background in half to help highlight the colour shift between the faces.

I had a conflicting issue where I wanted to have a lot of faces, but the smaller faces show less detail about the emotions and expressions the viewers will be able to notice. Although I would have liked for the faces to be bigger, I am happy with the final result!
