## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've been doing some final retouches, edits, and swapping/moving my letters around to get a final alphabet that makes some sort of 'sense' and has a system to it, even if it is very flexible. My initial finished alphabet was all just different letters that didn't really relate to one another, and while I loved the fact that they were all abstract and didn't follow the traditional lettering shape, after getting some feedback in the slack #design_feedback channel, I realised that I really had no rules or structure to my alphabet. There was no thought taken about each letter. I compromised by going through and looking at each individual letter, comparing it to it's traditional form in the latin alphabet. K, H, U, G, Q, and U are all quite dominant, powerful letters so I wanted my versions of these letters to possess this look as well. I and J are very similar in form, this is the same with M & N, and E & F, on the number side 8 & 9, and 2 & 3 share this as well, so you will see in my alphabet I kept with this rule. These letters have a very similar form but just slight details that stand them apart. I've found a happy medium, where my letters have a very 'laidback' structure to them, while remaining flamboyant and quirky. But not totally random and 'unconsidered'. 

I also fiddled around with background colours, I tried a few nice blues to act as the sky, but even the lightest blues or a white with a slightly blue undertone was just too much and took the spotlight away from my bright letters. I decided to stick with a classic white, I felt this looked best.

I have posted my original sketch and inspiration on my imgur account, to show how I originally intended my letterform to work, and how it has manifested into what it is now. my previous photo insert did not work so hopefully this will! - https://imgur.com/a/LxVk5HP
