## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

sketch

The original design was inspired by the bow and arrow. The shapes used are an arc, two straight lines and a triangle.

As the sketch shows, not every letter of the alphabet includes an arrow.

I wanted the person looking at it to be able to clearly distinguish what letter it is.

For the colors I used the clearest and cleanest white letters on a black background.
