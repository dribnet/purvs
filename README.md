I am current experimenting with my own shapes to create something abstract/different. In the process I have made in making this alphabet I have configured the arc to create an interesting shape the represents each letter, along side the line which also helps seperate each letter individually.

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the line relative to the origin
  * `offsety` : y offset of the line relative to the origin
  * `arcX`: x position of the arc
  * `arcY`: y position of the arc
  * `lineX`: y position of the line
  * `lineY`: y position of the arc
  * `arcW`: width of the arc
  * `arcH`: height of the arc
  * `arcS`: start point of the arc
