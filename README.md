## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

I've started thinking more about what my theme will be and the movements I want to confey. With this first attempt I only worked on one face and have started developing the concepts that I will follow

At the moment I'm leaning towards pastel colours and a certain style of building faces. focusing on the rosy cheeks, small eyes and big nose. This goes along a sort of flat, minimalistic representation of animals.

UPDATE

started developing a 2nd face, will still have to go back and add detail but for now I have to move on to the third face and also starte playing around with the sliders.

UPDATE

I've now completed all three faces, I'm aware that my part two goes in a completly different direction and style to part one, however I was still thinking about what I wanted this project to consist of and am happy with the change. I've now completed the three faces and added to all the slider to create the effects i wanted. Now, I'll move on to the randomizing.
