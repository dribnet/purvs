## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The Ocean Bloom

Today I got the photo's I needed for my Custom Pixel. All images reflect the plants the grow by the river and I will soon being working on the masks that allow for me to show that contrast between the two elements.

Ideally I want there to be a stark contrast between the pixels that represent the waters and the pixels that represent the lands.
