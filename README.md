I've started to flesh out the forest part of my generative landscape. I'm happy with how it looks at the moment but once I've fleshed out the rest of my landscape (possibly a river and some cityscape) I will begin refining it. Each tree type generates randomly at a random spot, all with equal chances of appearing. In the future I might refine it so a certain type of tree spawns more than others at a given time.
