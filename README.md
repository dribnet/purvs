For the design of letters, I chose to use straight lines.

But I added a little bit personal design to make my letters look angular.

However, for the use of stright lines, I think it can be more in-depth, so I will focus more on the colors use and others.



The current parameters are:

x1 : The x for the first point of line 1

y1 : The y for the first point of line 1

x3 : The x for the first point of line 2

y3 : The y for the first point of line 2

x5 : The x for the first point of line 3

y5 : The y for the first point of line 3

x6 : The x for the second point of line 3

y6 : The y for the second point of line 3

x7 : The x for the first point of line 4

y7 : The y for the first point of line 4

x8 : The x for the second point of line 4

y8 : The y for the second point of line 4
