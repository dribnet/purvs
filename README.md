Here I have added in the editor! I have hooked the sliders up to my six parameters and it works really well so far! I am yet to test whether the data it gives me is accurate to what is shows in editor.html but theres no reason for it not to be, so hopefully. This edior will vastly speed up my process of figuring out my other letters in the alphabet if all goes to plan.

Parameters:

  * `sizex` : size of x axis of smaller boxes
  * `sizey` : size of y axis of smaller boxes
  * 'offsetx' : x offset determines x position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * 'offsety' : y offset determines y position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * `boxX` : x position of second small square, relative to big square
  * `boxY` : y position of second small square, relative to big square
