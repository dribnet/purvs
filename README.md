I've iterated the sample code to have a new colorway and different sizing for the ellipses.

I intend to make linear fonts and perhaps a bold font with both circular and rectilinear elements.

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
