## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have been playing around with drawing different shapes to get a painterly effect that I like. Firstly, for the black part of the mask (the background of the photos) I went for a blurry water colour effect by drawing transparent ovals. I like how this makes everything look blended together and you can't notice the background colour as much as the colours on top blend with the background which looks a lot better than before especially in the dark areas.

I separated my code into two layers like how Phoebe showed in class to avoid the transparent circles affecting the colour of the foreground and so I could have different pixel densities. I changed how I was drawing the foreground paint effect to be diagonal lines with varying heights. I think this looks better than before as it looks like rough dabs of a brush.
