My idea for my alphabet is to use 2 triangles and looking at perhaps adding a line which stays in the same place. At the moment i have used the 2 triangles and am looking at where the line will be placed. I am abit confused about the parameters so i will look more into them and understanding them. I'm also still yet to understand how to put my letters into the alphabet bounding boxes etc.

The parameters per letter are now:
  let pos1x = posx + letterData["x"];
  let pos1y = posy + letterData["y"];
  let pos2x = posx + letterData["2x"];
  let pos2y = posy + letterData["2y"];
  let pos3x = posx + letterData["3x"];
  let pos3y = posy + letterData["3y"];
    
  let pos4x = posx + letterData["4x"];
  let pos4y = posy + letterData["4y"];
  let pos5x = posx + letterData["5x"];
  let pos5y = posy + letterData["5y"];
  let pos6x = posx + letterData["6x"];
  let pos6y = posy + letterData["6y"];
<!--   * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one -->
