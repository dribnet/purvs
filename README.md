## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

### Wed 24 Mar

Each of my letters is composed with lines and points forming constellation-like patterns. Points along the line fall on a select few points on a circle, the position of which is fixed, and it is each of the points that defines the line which is controlled by parameters.

The total number of parameters will be dependant on the maximum number of line segments. For A, B and C, the parameters are:
  * `size`: the radius of circle
  * `linePoints`: the number of line segments needed to complete the letter
  * `point1`: the starting point
  * `point2`: the second point
  * `point3`: the third point
  * `point4`: the fourth point
  * `point5`: the fifth point
