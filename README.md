## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of books I have read. The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
It takes about 10-20seconds to load
After receiving some feedback, I made a few minor changes to my code. One of them was i changed image 3, because I found the purple glasses and the pink book classed to much, so i change the book to a green one to make the glasses stand out more.
