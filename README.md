This font started of being an excersize in how much of the alphabet i could show with very primative shapes. After my first attempt at the letter "A" and then the devlopment of "H" looked suppisionly like a minimalist TIE-Fighterthe fonts name was born. As devlopment continued I paried back the number of shapes from 3 base shapes to 2 , and decided to have the white/negative shapes only be used for numbers in an attempt to streamline the aesthetic. This however was at the cost of readablility but it was laready quite difficult to read anyway so not much was lost.

My "swap words" contain:
 * `TIEDREAM` : The Font Name
 * ` NO MOON` : A Famous Star Wars Phrase
 * `ALDERAAN` : A Place That No Longer Exsists
 * `SCREEECH` : The Sound of the TIE-Fighter
 * `ORDER 66` : Just An Incredibly Sad Movie Moment
 * `UV COORD` : Poking Fun At How U and V Look The Same


Each of the letters are made up of a maximum combination of 4 of these shapes:
  * `a black verticle line`
  * `a small black circle`
  * `a white verticle line`
  * `a small white circle`

The parameters really act as 3 seperate parameters but due to the need to animated the letters they needed to be seperate. This coincidently makes the animation look ... sub-par.

The parameters per letter are:
  * `x1` : the x coordinate of the first shape
  * `x2` : the x coordinate of the second shape
  * `x3` : the x coordinate of the third shape
  * `x4` : the x coordinate of the forth shape
  * `y1` : the y coordinate of the first shape
  * `y2` : the y coordinate of the second shape
  * `y3` : the y coordinate of the third shape
  * `y4` : the y coordinate of the forth shape 
  * `shp1` : the type of the first shape 
  * `shp2` : the type of the second shape 
  * `shp3` : the type of the third shape
  * `shp4` : the type of the forth shape
