## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

my third test
here i played around with the "tiles"/pixelated look, as i liked how it looked when Phoebe shwoed it in the tutorial. in fact, i just put the code that Phoebe wrote into my code. I like how this looks, especially as it is on top, as i didn't like how some of the lines were overlapping the rectangles.
I will need to play around a bit more with the variables as the lines are showing a lot of the background through and i want the books to look more abstract and less like you can see the covers and titles (not that i don't want to show them off lol)

I also watched the colour tutorial, but i don't think im going to change anything colourwise as when i was taking the photos i wanted to focus on the colours themselves.
