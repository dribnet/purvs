### Maedas Clock

I have coded a new concept for my clock, it was emulated by the john maedas 12 clocks where the numbers rotate around a point. I want my clock to have the seconds in the center and the hours and minutes get bigger the further out the clock goes and I want them to be further out then the seconds with the hours being on the exterior of the clock.
