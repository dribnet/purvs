Alphabet:
I continued to develop one of my original idea. I used this style to create a couple of letters. In this case, the problem is I need more variables to define the different letter, like the colour for each part, the handle point, and so on. Also, I keep working on the details of my letters.
I got inspried by some of precedent including colours, shapes, and so on.
I try to define my consistent style with adding some constant value instead of variables. Anyway, with all the helps, I work out them within 12 variables. They refined all the details of each letter and number like size, position, joint, ratio, colour, shadow to make them stand out. I use blocks to emphasis the main part because of the contrast between blocks and lines. Also, I draw another shape with transparent colour to show the visual effect.

<!-- In the beginning, I had created the original sketch letters. I simplified the background to black, and I drawed the lines and  arcs, I was going to use the 2D shapes to build the 3D form. 

I created 3 different drafts. For the first one, I control the angle of ellipses and the position of lines to contruct different letters.Also, I changed the opacity of colous, looks a little bit like the 3 dimention.
The second one, I used the linear gradient to create the distinctive visual effect.
The third one, I draw the different basic shapes and control the parameter include the position, scale, opacity and so on to show the different combination. Also, I used the superellipse to get the interesting form.
I am going to put them into the system to have a look at what happen next step.

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
