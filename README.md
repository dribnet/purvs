Started creating the mapped features for the Zamasu style face. Having difficulties creating the anime type style with real face proportions as its usually exaggerated. The Ear and Earring most in the background are darker, and the nose will be facing the direction of the face. This was setup using 'if' statements and comparring the left ear and right ear distance from the eyes.
