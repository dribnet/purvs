## PS2 MDDN 342 2017


I have applied my code to the facemap code. My robots face was made up of very basic geometry and so
when mapping the face to pictures of real people a lot of the detail is simplified. I felt that the face
was too simple and so I decided to explore adding the 3d effect of the robot face like I had in ps1.
