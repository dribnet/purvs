First face is a generic lego face. I wanted to start out with something simple
to get used to coding again, so it uses only simple shapes along with an arc for the 
smile.

Second face is Rick from Rick and Morty. This time I wanted to do something more
complicated. I used multiple curves and beginShape()-endShape() to create the hair,
which was a bit of a challenge to get all the vertexes for, but I perservered. Overall,
this was a great learning experience!
