Got some feedback from Bex and Phoebe, will be updating my letters to make them more different from one another and cleaner so that it ressembles the bauhaus movement better.

This alphabet takes inspiration from [**Wassily Kandinsky**](https://www.wassilykandinsky.net), a Russian painter and pioneer of abstract art (1866-1944).
The [**Bauhaus art**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/be/fb/afbefbd7da9a1aea6ddf6237a48f7b50.jpg) movement inspires the colour palette because Kandinsky took part in it.

Each of my letters is composed of a circle, an arc and a rectangle. The size and position of each shape vary, the arc start and end, the rectangle rotation, and the rectangle rotation.

There are twelve parameters per letter:
  * `size` : height of the rectangle
  * `recOffsetx` : x offset of the rectangle
  * `recOffsety` : y offset of the rectangle
  * `rectAngle` : angle of rotation of the rectangle

  * `size1` : radius of the ellipse
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the ellipse
  * `offsety` : y offset of the ellipse

  * `size2` : radius of the arc
  * `arcOffsetx` : x offset of the arc
  * `arcOffsety` : y offset of the arc
  * `angleStart` : angle start for the arc
  * `angleEnd` : angle end for the arc
