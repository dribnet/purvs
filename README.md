The spacebar is used to change between each canvas. Sliders are available to change variables for the wallpaper pattern.

Pattern
My first wallpaper pattern concept consisted of two triangles grids that were overlapping each other in a way that created a swirl like pattern. I then developed this idea and changed the shapes to ellipses for a tidier aesthetic. I also changed the background colour to a yellow tone which gives a 70â€™s vibe. Next I played around with different variables such as changing the ellipse sizes, shifting and rotating a grid and changing the colour. This creates more variation and keeps it interesting.

Lanscape
I was inspired by my pattern to create a desert landscape, emulating sand dunes. Iniially I wanted to add non abstract cacti but felt it didn't fit with the aesthetcis therefore I have made it more abstract by taking similar circles from my pattern and using them to populate my landscape. Changing the colours of the landscape to represent day and night adds more variation too.
