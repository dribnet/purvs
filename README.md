### Magic Array Clock

For this project, my idea is to create a clock that has the element of ancient and personalized feeling (combine my two clock). My clock consists of three parts, they respectively represent the hours, minutes and seconds of the clock and I also use the different clour to show them because it can make this clock become more intuitive. 

This clock I combined the two clocks i made before because I keep the elements of a combination of squares and circles, it is my first colock what theme is. Secondly, I used the ancient feeling to create it, like my second clock to show the theme of ancient to let this clock be like a magic array, like my title. I also added number to show time on both sides on the picture because it can make this clock become more clearly. 

At the last, I also added the effect in the center of the clock because I think it can make this clock closer to shape of the magic array. 

Overall, these are all the decriptions of my clock.
