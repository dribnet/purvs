## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of various beaches in Nelson (Kaiteriteri and Rabbit Island). The masks on the first two images mask out the foam on the waves.

For this version I was following along with the class tutorial videos and making a grid of pixels, but I have the grid drawing only where the mask is black, creating absent space where the waves should be.
