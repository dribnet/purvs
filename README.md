## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've changed two of my images for a bit more variety and playing around with the images I already have. I'm quite fond of the new "input_2" image as the colour is more different than the others as it's more blue/purple and less pink. I also updated the masks for the images to make it more specific and blend better for the code, rather than having solid line masks using the pen tool on photoshop. I've updated the previews and I'm very fond of the output so far. Next thing I plan to do is play around with different shapes and sizes to try and portray better images, however, I'm quite satisfied with how it is now. I may also change the background colour to a darker purple or blue.
