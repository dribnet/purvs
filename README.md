### Pill Clock Alarm
For my alarm function, there is a small animation of the two empty hearts filling up rectangle by rectangle. This is to subtly remind the viewer to have their medicine on time to level up their health level. The color of the flashing pill digital clock also changes into a deeper red color for a more alerting visualisation.
