Originally, I had little parameters, roughly 6 I believe. However, due to complications with letters and legibility I added more and now I have 10 parameters. 

I wanted my idea to be different, yet simple, yet something that could gain a really good grade. So, I went with the idea of using negative space (figure ground) to create the illusion of the letters. Essentially, this was my initial idea, I just developed it and made adjustments accordingly. 

Firstly, I used ellipses the same colour as the background to create the letters, manipulating the viewer. I then changed it to rectangles because I thought it looked more legible. With the letters in alphabet.js I developed them to become more legible and tried to make them the same height, or same style because it is a font after all. In terms of colour, I wanted yellow to make the letters stand out and a more darker mid-blue kind of colour to contrast the two in a way (so the background doesn't drown out the letters).

Fast forward to creating the interactions and adding the exhibition.js.  For the interaction I did attempt to add the animation, the same one shown in week 5. For the exhibition, I had a first idea for a font name called 'Medieval' because I thought it looked Medieval-ish. However, I looked online at Medieval fonts and the two did not look like a similar style. And this is why I changed it to 'Illusion'.

For my final, I incorporated the new font name 'Illusion' in exhibition.js. It's not quite an illusion in terms of a hypnotizing image type thing but more in the sense that I'm using the negative space to create the illusion of the letters.
