## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I have now made a solid set of nine different parameters that can be set for each letter, incorporated them into the editor, and created my first complete alphabet based on my original sketch. I will ask for some design feedback on this one in slack as I work out where to take the design next. The editor was very helpful in working out the values for wach letter but even with the editor it takes a lot longer than I expected to create an entire alphabet!

the parameters per letter are:
Main triangle
  - rotate1B
  - stroke1Big
first small triangle
  - offset1Smallx
  - offset1Smally
  - rotate1S
  - stroke1Small
second small triangle
  - offset2Smallx
  - offset2Smally
  - rotate2S
