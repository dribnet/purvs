### Sand Clock

Here is my final work of the sand clock. I set the alarm function and made the effect for that. I kept my idea about falling sand to create the alarm function because if I use the idea in making the background, the numbers of time when the alarm is off may be hard to read. When I started to code the clock, I wanted it to be simple but designed, and now I think I already reach the goal. The alarm part may be refined in the future. At the beginning of coding the alarm, I tried to use objects and array function to make the falling sand move in more random and flexible ways but failed, so I changed my code into easier ways but the final result lost some fun.
