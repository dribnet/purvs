## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This version here I applied patterns to the background, and increase the pattern sizes of the mask layer. 
It has the styles of oil painting in the mask layers(boxes), I like how the pattern I created overlapping each other which gives a little ' fluffy' texture but not too much.
