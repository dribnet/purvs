## Zoomin' Space (v2)
I'm straying away from my ps3 visuals, but still want to try something with blend modes. My idea for this was just to have an ethereal black whole structure that would become more complex and saturated with zoom. I'm finding the coordinate system particularly with smaller sizing hard to understand, I want to work on that more for layering different ellipses and other shapes.

## Zoom Test (v1)
Just merged in the example, trying out zooming - though it seems I've done it wrong as I'm manually making the ellipses small (e.g. 0.001). I'll need to wait for Tom to explain it better.

## Ideation Sketch (v0)
Looking over my idea from PS3 I don't think I want to go in that direction for this problem set. While the kaleidoscope effect is really interesting and provides a kind of fractal design suitable for this, I want to try something new in a style more suited to still images, since the effect my PS3 provides I think is only really effective in animation.
Until I have a new idea though I have made a sketch based on PS3, which involves different versions of my hand-in. Zooming in the patterns will become more complex and kaleidoscopic, as with what actually happens in my code with the expanding circles.
