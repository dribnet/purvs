## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I am not use the smartmask for the final design because made the masks by myself is more easy than made the smartmask.

Theme: Autism
My design theme is about 'Autism', Autism usually manifests in childhood and the main characteristic of children with autism is not communicating with others，also lack of emotional expression just like dolls so I choose my ball joint dolls to relate the theme because those dolls are really similar like real children but never talk or never have any expression. All my photos use portrait size so that it can display dolls well in the pictures.

Code:
I remove the background color only highlight the dolls and make dolls colorful, for background I use the small rectangle with space because the surrounding environment has nothing to do with child who has the Autism and may also make them feel uncomfortable, so I choose the rectagle which has the sharp shape. I choose all the shape to be simple because I do not want the image looked really mess and also I have three masks so it need much time on render so the simple shape is easy to help me test code and also relate the theme, because the color and sharpness is more important for me. I use the big circle to form the body part of the doll because I want to express an empty feeling，and I use small ellipse with different space and size than the body circle to form the face of the doll so that it can make the doll's face more clear especially their eyes，because I want to show that 'The world may not be same in children's eyes who has Autism'. For the mouth mask I choose four different size recatangles so that on their face only their mouths are not clear. The mouth code cover the face code so that it just like even they have mouth but just something stop them to talk.
