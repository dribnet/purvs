## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Alphabet fix

In order to fix the issues I was having with the alphabet I scaled down my letters, and removed the back rectangle which results in all these structures being unclear and confusing. However the code is now working successfully. I now need to move my letters and digits inside the squares, and add the rectangle.
