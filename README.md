Sketch.js - letters
Each of my letters is composed with two lines and an arc inspired by the knitting I was doing at the time. 
Both the rotation and position of the arc and the positions of the lines are flexible. 

I have 12 parameters per letter:
  * `height` : the height of the arc 
  * `width` : the width of the arc
  * `line 1 x1` : x coordinate of first point of first line
  * `line 1 y1` : y coordinate of first point of first line
  * `line 1 x2` : x coordinate of second point of first line
  * `line 1 y2` : y coordinate of second point of first line
  * `line 2 x1` : x coordinate of first point of second line
  * `line 2 y1` : y coordinate of first point of second line
  * `line 2 x2` : x coordinate of second point of second line
  * `line 2 y2` : y coordinate of second point of second line
  * `angleStart` : begining angle of arc
  * `angleEnd` : ending angle of arc
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
