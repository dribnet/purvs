## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have changed two of my images as i didn't like how my mask turned out for the first and second image which made the outcome design not look as good as i wanted to. 
i still wanted to stick to the theme of the landscape. In all three of my images it shows the sky, which are all different colours. I want to make sure the colour difference shows in my end design. 
I am still playing around with the code. I did change my code from my previous design, all ellipse and squares are unifrom and are very tiny. When viewig it with bigger ellipses and squares, you couldnt really see the image, but now that i have made it bigger, you can see the image better and shows the details. I still need to tweek the design as it does not show the sky tones so ill need to work on that.
