For the alarm I wanted it to be quite simple, and since the background is blue, the alarm just turns into a red background.
When the alarm is set, but not yet going off, a red sleeve slowly moves from the right. 
When the red covers all of the blue background, the alarm goes off, and the red changes to be a bit brighter for clarity.
