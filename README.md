Final: Tropical Static Alphabet

  I made an initial sketch on paper before creating my alphabet by code, which has helped me a lot during the process of hard coding the lines. I think my sketch and this final outcome are similar with minor changes. Originally I did not have a inspiration for my alphabet but after creating it with code and I was able to add colours, I was inspired my television static. I found it a suitable inspiration because I was using lines and wanted the colours to be transparent so the bottom line colours can come through. 

  Starting to code as shown in my Part 1: Initial Ideas update, gave me an idea in how to work with lines. I understood that I needed to limit the amount of lines I'd use - which I decided four worked best for all the characters I made. Four lines already gave me a lot of parameters to work with and I made sure I stayed under the maximum limit. I found that I didn't like the the defualt rounded corners of the lines especially with the style I was going for. So I have found StrokeCap allowed me to get the sharp corners I wanted. From this stage I used Adobe Colours to help me find the best colour palettes, which made it more efficient. I also decided to challenge myself by creating & as my default character, as it looks appealing and different compared to other characters.

  During the progress of creating all my characters, I always considered how each line would move/change to their next character. This was a beneficial move on my part because I have basically done the interpolation part of the project. Using 4 lines and the same 4 colours helped the lines look more fluid when changing. I especially liked how the letters T changes to U, O to K, and Y to X. I have also added a light tint of colour in the background so that the brightness of the letters is lessened slightly with the muted pale blue background.
  After creating all the characters in my alphabet I decided to make some characters such as 8 exceed the rectangle boundary. This was a design decision because certain angles allowed the lines to look as if they are connected and square. Characters S and Z have a line with a thicker stroke weight so that it can harmonize better with the other 3 lines. 

  I have tried multiple colour palettes and loved the tropical vibe of this final colour palette. It still uses the colours seen in television static but I decided on using the brighter colours. I tried using the dark blue with it but it was bothering me and I think the red works better with the other three colours. The colours has challenged me to think what line I should assign with certain colours, because I've found some colours look unappealing together or they look too bold. I enjoyed how some of my characters look more interesting because of how I played with colour and "illusions" you could say. For example, since I wanted to incorporate all 4 lines no matter what, I strategized the colours i'd use for the letter X. I managed to use all 4 lines while making sure that the letter X is more obvious. 


The Parameters per letter:

    "lineX1": X axis for line 1
    "lineY1": Y axis for line 1
    "lineX2": X axis for line 2
    "lineY2": Y axis for line 2
    "lineX3": X axis for line 3
    "lineY3": Y axis for line 3
    "lineX4": X axis for line 4
    "lineY4": Y axis for line 4
    "lineX5": X axis for line 5
    "lineY5": Y axis for line 5
    "lineX6": X axis for line 6
    "lineY6": Y axis for line 6
    "lineX7": X axis for line 7
    "lineY7": Y axis for line 7
    "lineX8": X axis for line 8
    "lineY8": Y axis for line 8
    "sWeight1": Stroke weight for yellow line, the rest of the 3 lines have a stroke weight of 30.
