## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2
Final:
My idea comes from the hand letterforms. Audiences can figure out the letters from the look like of my letter fonts. The lines replace the vertical strokes or the leftmost or rightmost part in the letters. Triangles replace spaces in letters and radians in numbers. The orientation of the pointed tip of the triangle is the opening of the number. For example, E, I use a line and two triangles. The line is the vertical line in E. Two triangles means the space between the three horizontal short lines in E. The grey triangle is the top space, and the orange one represents the bottom space. My letters are very playful and lively and they are similar to trees. So I choose green as my main color tone. But the main tone prefers to grey. The grey color will make the letters feel comfortable, harmonious, and reduced the sharpness of the letters. I choose 11 words for my exhibition. These words include all of the letters and numbers. Also, the interaction page shows the wonderful processes of letters.


The parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * sectionx: x of the first point of the left line
  * sectiony: y of the first point of the left line
  * sectionx1: x of the second point of the left line
  * sectiony1: y of the second point of the left line
  * sectionx2: x of the first point of the top triangle
  * sectiony2: y of the first point of the top triangle
  * sectionx3: x of the second point of the top triangle
  * sectiony3: x of the second point of the top triangle
  * sectionx4: x of the third point of the top triangle
  * sectiony4: y of the third point of the top triangle
  * sectionx5: x of the first point of the botton triangle
  * sectiony5: y of the first point of the botton triangle
  * sectionx6: x of the second point of the botton triangle
  * sectiony6: y of the second point of the botton triangle
  * sectionx7: x of the third point of the botton triangle
  * sectiony7: y of the third point of the botton triangle
  * section2x: x of the first point of the right line
  * section2y: y of the first point of the right line
  * section2x1: x of the second point of the right line
  * section2y1: y of the second point of the right line
