## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I wanted to play around with the code itself, I thought it could use random to give so more interest to the design but worked the complete opposite! I initially had the point size included in my array with gave massive big lines and dots that made no sense and stoped my design for being 'readable'. I then managed to calm this down as seen in my outputs but not being able to control the random is messy and I feel that because the flowers are such organic and random shapes, you lose the understanding of the flowers


The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
