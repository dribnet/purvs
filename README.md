Fireworks.

The design I have worked with was with the concept of firworks exploding and being frozen in time. 

Using the frame work geven to us I first by making ellipses appear on the grid at random locations using the noise function. From there I worked on giving them a diffrent color and shade to give them depth and go and some intrest. 

On scrolling in I the noise on the fireworks start to clear up eventualy revealing the their core smaller particles with in the main boddy of the ellipse.
