This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

In my case, in each of my faces I use 4 or 5 sliders. For the first face I used my previous solution but added controls for the height, position of eye ball, hair, mouth shape, and number of eyes.

In the second version, I focused more on the look than expression for Action Kamen. 

In the third face I tried out a mummy idea. It always keep a funny face.
