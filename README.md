## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After some thought in this lesson, I have decided to go with a study focused piece, as it is relatable a large group of people. It will consist of a student doing soe sort of study, where everything around is blurry except for their focus. This blurryness could also be around their head to have some symbolism of tiredness or stress. I will look more into potentiall photos and have some ready for next lesson.

So far I have just expeerimented with how much of the screen i can cover whilst still retaining the central focus of the image, as this will help me when I need to blur a background yet keep a face or a laptop in focus.
