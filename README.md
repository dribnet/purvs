## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

These are the 3 different styles i used with 3 different images i got off my phone. they all express a different example covered in class. I just used these to get more comfortable with the code and to start thinking what my idea will be for the final. 
I'm thinking of doing portrait photos of friends and family that i recognise and try challenge myself to create a poster which keeps the image making sense but arent able to be recongisable by me. To challenge the idea familar and unfamiliar faces. I think this will be interesting to explore what facial features are key to recongise someone.
