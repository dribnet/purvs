Interaction

For my interaction I wanted the grid not to simply be filled cell by cell, but to have shapes morph underneath the grid.  Which is why I went with experiment number two for my final. Keeping the idea of having the grid above the shapes clear. When placed with the letter forms I believe they are very obvious to read but on their own they are not. If I had more time I would have liked to have the shapes move more freely underneath the grid and perhaps have them morph differently not so harshly. However, this does work considering the shapes are rectangular and it is a very computer type of alphabet.

My parameters at the moment are;

Right-which filled the right side of the box
Left-which filled the left side of the box.
Top-Filled the Top of the box.
Bottom- Filled the Bottom of the box.
M1- Filled Middle two squares in the first row.
M2- Filled Middle two squares in the second row.
M3- Filled Middle two squares in the third row.
M4- Filled Middle two squares in the fourth row.
