I have completed my alphabet and my numbers. I am now going to look/work on the over all apparence of my design. I Like my colours I have chosen, however I might need to work on resizing my objects so the look more visually appealing and are not too overwhelming. I now have 12 parameters per letter so I wont be adding anymore. my parameters consist of size, rotate, position and colour. Overall Now I am just working on completeing the final touches to make sure my letters work with eachother and are styled/ porportioned correctly. I have merged the final piece of code so I am able to view my code/ alphabet in the different directories and create words etc. I designed my letters so they are hard to read however but wanted them to follow a theme and style. I like my letters because I find them different and look cool all together.
