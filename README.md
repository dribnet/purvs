Distribution experiment.

I was fairly satisfied with the natural distribution for most of the parameters. 

The only values I felt would be improved through the addition of distribution variables, were eye number and teeth value.

I distributed the eyes to have a higher focus at a mean of two eyes. This made the instances of three and one eye more rare.

I distributed the teeth to have a very low focus with a mean more geared towards no teeth. This meant that teeth would be a rarer occurence.
