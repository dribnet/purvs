Lego Faces

Have explored options with arrangement, taking inspiration from the layout and design of LEGO instructions, with the light blue/grey background and yellow trim, as well as numbers for each head. I plan on exploring this a bit more but really happy with how it looks at the moment.

Have worked and added some different mouths, plan on adding more but we will see how I go for time.
