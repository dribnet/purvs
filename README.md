after spending last session playing with shapes and parameters i have added a grotesk font to the files for me to keep an eye on each character and get a feel for the kind of shapes i need to make.

I think I am going to try the triangle style that i  began exploring last week.

I am now playing with the idea of using cyrillic instead of the latin alphabet just for funzies

If i do choose to continue with the cyrillic im going to have to re work my sketch ideas significantly though

tried doing the first four characters of the cyrillic alphabet in my existing style and i have to say im not a fan.

this might work but I dont think so somehow - this is gonna take a lot of fixing

I have sat down with a pen and paper to try and work out my system with as few variables as possible and i think the best bet is to map coordinates across the print area and use them as true false parameters to draw lines betweeen.

so in the process of trying to figure this out i didn't push pop and i broke everything

ive got it working and made the cutouts pink for debug things
