I have decided on the face style I wish to continue with for this project.
It's an abstraction of a particular tattoo artist's style I really enjoy.

I have now set up my 3x5 grid, and started using the focusedRandom() method to achieve more variety in my faces.
So far, I have randomised the face shapes, mouth 'curvature', and pupil direction.
As I'm slowly becoming more comfortable with the idea of randomising parameters, I will continue to randomise different features of my faces.
