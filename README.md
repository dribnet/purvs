## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have added a few more photos and tried a couple of different techniques on them. for input 2 i tried using
lines to connect the points inside the white of the mask and it looked quite cool and could be a direction i could look into.
I also tried the gird on input 3 which worked well and there is a lot i could do with that as the base.
