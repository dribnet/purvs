## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos I have taken myself of my dog as a puppy. The mask highlights the entirety of the dog. I want to show a theme that relates to the negative imapcts of designer dogs and puppy farming that occurs in this country. For my first design, I am planning to have the background represented by a wide range of dog glypths to show the idea of designer dogs and have the actual dog in the photo to be a silhouette.

So far, the algorithm uses my glyph design from the last project to do the background, although I haven't altered it yet to get the desired outcome. The silhouette is created using transparent ellipses. I did this because otherwise it looks quite blocky and I like that it makes the silhouette look a bit more undefined.
