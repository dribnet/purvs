Name: Ice Field

For this project, I choose four quadrangles as the main body. At first, I wanted to create a visual effect similar to a gemstone or a star, but with the constant modification of the project, I found that these letters looked more like icebergs, so I changed my original idea and improved the design through color modification, making this design more "polar" and “ice field”.

In the processing of letters, I used the position and size of those quadrangles to make different combinations to represent them. While guaranteeing their spirit, I also added some personal understandings to make them look quiet different but have certain connections.

For the numbers, I choose the system of Roman numerals as my main system. That means that I formed a new number by combining existing numbers which I made before. I think this kind of combination is very interesting and fits my design idea, so I designed them on this basis.


Each of my letters is composed of 4 symmetrical quadrangles. And there are 3 parameters to control each of them. So there are 12 parameters in my every letter.
The 12 parameters per letter:

  * `size1` : the size of the red quadrangles
  * `posX1` : the X position of the red quadrangle
  * `posY1` : the Y position of the red quadrangle

  * `size2` : the size of the blue quadrangles
  * `posX2` : the X position of the blue quadrangle
  * `posY2` : the Y position of the blue quadrangle

  * `size3` : the size of the 1st quadrangle with edges
  * `posX3` : the X position of the 1st quadrangle with edges
  * `posY3` : the Y position of the 1st quadrangle with edges

  * `size4` : the size of the 2nd quadrangle with edges
  * `posX4` : the X position of the 2nd quadrangle with edges
  * `posY4` : the Y position of the 2nd quadrangle with edges
