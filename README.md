## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Phoebe allowed my random as it did not affect my letter form and was more for mood setting and their changes don't change per letter.

Each of my letters is composed with two main circles. The  position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the planet.d
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

Each circle also has colours assosiated to it.
  * `ColourPlanet` : Changes the planets colour in sets of 4.
  * `ColourSun` : Changes the sun colour based on number, letter or blank.

Lastly is the shadow wich has 5 positions.
	* `Shadow` : Changes the shadow position. 0 blank, 1-4 corresponds to each planet position.

Sketch updated with a design potential and also changed preview and thumbnail to match. Design idea is solar system. planet moves between 12, 3, 6, 9 to make 4 moves. Blank is in the entre.
The sun colour indicates if it is a number, letter or blank. Black is white sun with black planet in the center.

Added Stars and then added shadow to the planets while making the atmosphere darker. Also added a small moon

I tested my orbits and decided i liked the flower looking one as it gave it some depth and interest. It is a unique look at gravitational field design. 

My design is made to continue with the whole space theme my designs have had before. Its also based on webdings. Each leter changes either colour and/or position. The sun changes to indicate either number or letter and blank is distinctively different.
