## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So I have added in the images to the program that I have taken. They aren't anything too specail, they are just an assortment of some things that I use to rest and relax, going with my theme of the importance of play. 

I have made a few changes to the algorithm. For starters I have decided that I will not draw the background of objects that are not in the masks. This is because I was going to have them blurred or something along those lines anyway as I want the focus to be on the masked objects. So I thought that it would potentially look cleaner if I instead removed the unmasked areas and then things like stars and stuff randomly, to not make it feel as empty. 

So far I am liking the idea and am just going to keep tweaking it until I am really happy with it.
