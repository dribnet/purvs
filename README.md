## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I tried out the smartmask on my images but I decided not gto use them as the things they identified as objects were not things that I wanted to highlight. It found masks of boats and other smaller things like that, when my theme is more about the sea and the sky so it didn't really work for me and I will instead stick with my masks that I already made. I might adjust my masks a bit though and see how that changes how the images look.
