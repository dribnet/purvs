## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After looking at my three series images together, I realised that the 1st and 2nd images, the brightness is much lower than the 3rd one. This is probably due to the images being taken at different ties in the day. A possible solution would be to slightly edit the brightness in the 3rd image.

I also noticed that the stripey lines in the 1st image are much more harsh than the 2nd and 3rd. I am unsure why that could be and hoping that it is something I can easily resolve as I think it looks really distracting.

However, as a full series I think the images look really good together. I will however, continue to adjust and play around with the final editing of the images and deal with the orange line issue. I think I would also like to add in a custom shape for certain parts of the image.
