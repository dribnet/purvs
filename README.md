## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Animation
   
For this test I didn't change much but I added in a fill for the inner arc and sawpped the stroke colours around. I think that it looks interesting but I don't think I will use this. The colours are nice though. I think that I will continue to play with the colours some more and test out some animations. So far I haven't had any problems wih my code.  

pos2x this draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y this draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x this draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 this rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 this rotates the inner arc
