## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I am looking at creating a systematic design concept that can help me create the letterforms. I'm looking at what i would call nodes that each line can be drawn from in order to reduce the amount of parameters needed in order to draw each letter

I have completed a basic sketch, in the process of trying to create an isometric design i stumbled across this abstract version of what i was going for and thought it could have some interesting implications with the interpolation so i decided to bite the bullet and spend some time fleshing it out. It still needs a lot of work. but ultimately i feel there is a lot of potential for it to work out.

I have pushed this concept further and added a pretty cool neon look for fun :)
