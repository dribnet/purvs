Part 6: Final
**Control Panel in the top Left of the screen**
With the Styling overhaul I achieved a design which is different than my previous project with WebGL, and building my own frame work proved to be a fun challenge, since I was trying to implement in features of a much more 2D based system, in a 3D ecosystem.

The retro style becomes more apparent as the tour moves in, which was the style I wanted, since at "fully zoomed out" it is fairly simple, then it looks more "indepth/detailed" as it zooms in, along with small styling changes the longer you look at it.

Overall I am really happy with my final outcome, and really gave me a insight to 3D graphics on a web based platform, along with actually writing code using different languages at once.

NOTE: If the animations is extreamly "laggy", you may have "hardware acceleration" off in chromes setting. Just go to settings -> Advanced settings, and enable "Use hardware acceleration when available" under the Systems sections
