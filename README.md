Trying out a total new much higher contrast colour scheme. I like the contrast but I do not like it as much as my previous blue/pink because I feel those softer colours are much better at catching the sort of playful aesthetic I am going for so I will go back to them.

Parameters:

  * `sizeB1x` : size of x length of two of the smaller boxes
  * `sizeB1y` : size of y length of two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2x' : size of x length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2y' : size of y length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * `posB1x` : x position of first small square
  * `posB1y` : y position of first small square
  * 'posB2x' : x position of the second small square
  * 'posB2y' : y position of the second small square
  * `posB3x` : x position of the third small square
  * `posB3y` : y position of the third small square
  * 'posB4x' : x position of the fourth small square
  * 'posB4y' : y position of the fourth small square
