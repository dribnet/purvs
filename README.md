Continued alphabet creation

After doing some research into oragami,I found that there isnt a whole lot of cutting of paper in it.So my design is just some folded paper rather than origami which is an art in itself.


The twenty parameters per letter:
  * "posx1": 
  * "posx2": 
  * "posx3": 
  * "posx4": 
  * "posx5": 
  * "posx6": 
  * "posx7": 
  
 * "triposx1": 
 * "triposx2": 
 * "triposx3": 

 * "posy1": 
 * "posy2": 
 * "posy3": 
 * "posy4": 
 * "posy5": 
 * "posy6": 
 * "posy7": 
 * "triposy1": 
 * "triposy2": 
 * "triposy3":
