## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In this project 3 we need to make some pixel photos. and on that time the city is still in level 2, so I was use some past photo, I choose some nature pictures and use three best of them.

The topic of my project 3 is “Wonderland”, I use 3 nature picture for the basic picture and input image. Then I make 3 fairy masks and use different poses and effects to show the fantasy and beauty. 

In the first image, I chose a shot of the lake behind the trees, I make some leaves mask on the trees part and the direction of the leaves on the right side and left side are different. on the centre of the picture, I make a fairy who stay on the lake and there are some butterflies around her. I want use first image to make a peaceful and fantasy feeling. And behind the trees is feel like someone come to this place in the first time.

The second image is a fairy sit on kind of lines. I use a ellipse mask in this image, so it can clearly show the focus point in the picture. I use 2 lines around the fairy, and use star as the pattern so it looks fantasy. I use soft curve and lone distance on these lines so it looks relived and freedom. The fairy is sit on the lines looks peaceful and comfortable.

The last image is my favourite one. I dray some lines from centre to outside, and each two lines make areas, I use two different style and colour on these areas so it look like different Worlds, I still use soft line in these image, and those lines is start from fairy’s hand it look like she can control everything, in this image I want to show a beautiful and powerful feeling.

For the mask, I was try to make the mask that only have black and white, then I want to make some interesting images, so I try to draw some butterflies and curve lines in grey, however it didn’t change to much so I draw some fairy in the mask and use another colour to make the change. so for the final masks I use 4 colours: black, white, dark grey and light gray.
