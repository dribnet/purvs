EDITOR & ARRANGEMENT CHANGE

Today I have been working on the variation between faces. I have changed the arrangement of my faces in order to see the changes more clearly but I don't think this will be my final arrangement. I am thinking of hard coding 3 bear bodies/ or maybe torsos and just having the faces change but I'm not sure yet. I have added nearly all the paramenters on face 2 (the brown bear) i only need to add the mouth curve values and then really refine how it's going to look. I have played around with changing ears on the other two bears (face1- panda and face3- polar bear/lighter bear) and I need to refine how they are going to look as well.
