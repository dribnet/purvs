| 27/05/2020 | First tests with Project 3. I knew that I just wanted to try working with a screenshot I took in Elite: Dangerous a few weeks ago of a sun. I also figured, I could just desaturate and slightly modify the levels to make it an appropriate mask, and the end result turns out pretty okay. At this time I haven't looked into anything else too much.								   |

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
