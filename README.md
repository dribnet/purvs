Part 2: Alphabet

I have almost finished all the work, but the animation is still not very smooth. You can see that the first match is always hanging in the air, but I also want to show that it is a jumping feeling.
Like a flame jumps to its place and forms a new letter.
  


The twelve parameters per letter:

  let posX1 = letterData["X1"];
  let posY1 = letterData["Y1"];
  let posX2 = letterData["X2"];
  let posY2 = letterData["Y2"];
  let posX3 = letterData["X3"];
  let posY3 = letterData["Y3"];
  let posX4 = letterData["X4"];
  let posY4 = letterData["Y4"];
    
  let rotR1 = letterData["R1"];
  let rotR2 = letterData["R2"];
  let rotR3 = letterData["R3"];
  let rotR4 = letterData["R4"];
