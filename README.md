My alphabet is based on the Morse Code, where the order of the goes from top to bottom.
I will have animations with transitions from a dot to a dash and vice versa.
I have a few ideas about how to remove dots or dashes when not needed anymore. 

The six parameters per letter:
  * `first` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the first character 
  * `second` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the second character 
  * `third` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the third character 
  * `fourth` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the fourth character 
  * `fifth` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the fifth character 
  * `offset` : the offset in the y axis; the more characters the smaller the offset(offset = # of nullâ€™s)
