### Recreation of One of John Maeda's Clocks.


In the recreation of one of John Maeda's 12 clocks I decided to first just play around. Firstly I decided to change the colour of the numbers and then the background to blue. This sort of developed further as I wanted to try add some different shapes. This began as random but the ellipses I placed around began to look like bubbles and the clock began to look like it was underwater or in an aquarium. I liked the idea of this so I continued it and thought that it would also be cool if the bubbles at the bottom were not filled in because they were popped.
