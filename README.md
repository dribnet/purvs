## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I used Phoebes's template code from the tutorial on blackboard and have just been playing around with the different pieces of code to get more comfortable with it. I think the photos look really cool so far even with just this sort of basic code. They're all photos I took of my younger brother on his skateboard. The colour wave is really autumy and warm so I really like how the colours are displaying through the pixels. I'm not 100% sure just yet if I want to keep using these photos, I love how vibrant the third one is, so I may take some more of him with a brighter range of colours but then I also do really like the green and beige colour wave in the first two so I'm a little conflicted.

I'm going to keep playing and creating my own code now to try and establish a theme.
