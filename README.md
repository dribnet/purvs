## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

-18/5-
Im not sure what sort of theme I want to go with for the images yet, as placeholders to play around with I used a render from a previous project, a picture from a game that i happened to have on my USB and the same Te Aro campus photo as before. 
I removed the mask on my first two images, I want to play around with colour and try have over or under saturation in the masked area. 
For the algorithim I have the ellipses draw and get smaller over time, they start out quite large then draw smaller and smaller which slowly adds in extra detail to the image and creates a nice layered effect. the ellipses also have a range when they draw so that they pick a random size between two values (which get smaller over time).
