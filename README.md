## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I wanted to refine the colour scheme further so changed this. I don't like how the orange lines are super pixelated and am trying to adjust this so that it is more of a smooth line.

I also changed the model colour to an almost grey scale which i think looks super effective.

Working on my 2nd mask and output now.
