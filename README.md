## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I first tried an image i took a while ago of my old scooter & a sunset. I chose this because I thought the sunset would look nice as a 'block' style blackground predominantly one colour, with slight variations in tone. The reason I also chose one with the scooter in the foreground is I'm thinknig my project will be something about transportation - perhaps in an urban setting. More on this to come!
