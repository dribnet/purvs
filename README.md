## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

Part 1 :
I've updated my little pig face onto the new code and hope to move on now.

Part 2:

I've updtaed and merged the code from part 2 and I've also picked my faces, since its a pig, I've gone with 'Frank Oz' who is the voice of Ms. Piggy, 'Christina Ricci' who plays Penelope in Penelope - where she has a snoot for a nose - and finally Christine Cavanaugh who voices Babe.

Part 3:

Part 1, 2 and 3 have now been added to the sketch, I am now working on developing the faces.

UPDATE 

I'm still trying to figure out the code, I am struggling a bit and will rpobably need some help to achive what I am aiming for with this project. I've added the ears and started playing around with other factors, my goal at the moment is to make it look like each person has face paint on.

Part 4:

I've now with some help been able to understand the code better and what needs to be done, I've started adding the sldiers and parameters for adding personality to the faces, more on that later. but, so far I have make up on/off when its a woman, nose changes, eye colour and eyebrow changes and cheek colour changes -depending on skin tone-.

Part 5:

I've started plugging in the values and seeing how they respond to the code, so far its going good, I still need to add more sliders and more variables so work in progress.

UPDATE 

I've plugged in all my variables but will hopefully add more, i feel like I'm starting to get some good identifiers and ways of seeing what characteristics of the persons face are. Further work to be done.

UPDATE

I've now added more images to the mix to see how my variables are responding, so far it looks good and now I'm taking a further look at other elements of the face, I've started changing the ears and will see what else i can do.

UPDATE 
last commit wasnt working quite right due to some errors i had in my face_data.json, however that's now fixed and I'll get back to development.
