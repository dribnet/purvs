## Negative space experiment

I decided to experiment with negative space to improve the silhouettes of my letters. The tutors said the silhouettes were a strong point in my design so I wanted to focus on getting them to look good, which was limited by the fixed shapes of the leaves so I thought of experimenting with negative space to give more adaptability. This also connects well to my autumn leaf theme as dying leaves usually have pieces missing from them rather than perfect leaf shapes. 

To help me focus on the silhouettes, I worked in the editor with the leafs and stick the same colour and a circle the same colour as the background that I could change the x and y position and the width and height. Initially I thought of having not all of the letters with the negative space circle as there were some that didn't really need it. But as I used it for nearly all of the letters and didn't really need it for most of the numbers, I decided to make all the letters have it and none of the numbers have it to make them more distinct from each other. I also changed how I was drawing some of the letters (notably G and 4) and adjusted the height of some to make them more uniform in height.

I currently have 13 parameters (>>>4 new ones);
	"offsetx": X position of the first leaf
    "offsety": Y position of the first leaf
    "leaf2Posx": X position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "leaf2Posy": Y position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "rotate1": rotation angle of the first leaf
    "rotate2": rotation angle of the second leaf
    "rotate3": rotation angle of the stick
    "stickPosx": X position of the stick in relation to first leaf
    "stickPosy": Y position of the stick in relation to first leaf
 	>>>"circlex": X position of the negative space circle in relation to first leaf
    >>>"circley": Y position of the negative space circle in relation to first leaf
    >>>"circlew": width of the negative space circle circle
    >>>"circleh": height of the negative space circle circle
