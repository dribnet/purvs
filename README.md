For the Chinese mask, I randomize its eyebrow value to change shape and color, eye value to change the shape of eyes, mouth value to open mouth, skin value to change skin color, and triangle value to generate triangles, additionally, increase the strokeWeight for eye rim and forehead.

Add beard value, change mouth value and brighten color value.

Now eye rims will increse or decrease as eyes move.
