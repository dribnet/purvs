## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

--previous attempt--
I first tried an image i took a while ago of my old scooter & a sunset. I chose this because I thought the sunset would look nice as a 'block' style blackground predominantly one colour, with slight variations in tone. The reason I also chose one with the scooter in the foreground is I'm thinknig my project will be something about transportation. I tried taking some new photos of bikes/motorbikes. But the colours were a huge appeal of the last photograph that I can't recreate as it's up to the weather. I played around a bit with different foreground background parts, & cropping closer images on the bikes. But I think they are too detailed to be conveyed how i want in this style. I was thinking about doing something with helmets (encouraging people to wear them) i thought it would be cool to have like a shatter effect on the pixel showing how a helmet can break but that;s good because it means your head is safe. This is particularly relevant currently with Wellington public recently signing a petition for cyclists not to be required to wear helmets. I personally think that is silly, would be like making seatbels non-compulsory. While this is a good idea, helmets also don't photograph very well! I have several helmets from motorbike to bmx to road bikes, but all are either too colourful or too plain. Also transparent visors are difficult to photograph. 

- I tried giving the background a more linear style, so that the foreground felt more full. I created the background using the noise funcion to make a series of random points that are all connected by a line. The interesting thing about this method is that the outcome varies quite a large amount depending on the noise seed. It also created quite a few interesting patterns at times.

I added a few gradient changes to the foreground, gives it sort of an embossed feel, but it doesn't fit with the background.
