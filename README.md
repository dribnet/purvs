## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Working through the in-class tutorials. Finished off today's tutorial working on the x and y step grid. I think so far this is my favourite effect as I feel it looks super pixelated and makes the viewer be unaware of what the real image is.

The images above are photos of my friend from an assignment from last year in the studio algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
