Part 1: Initial Ideas - testing in code

Each of my letters is composed with a circle and two lines. The circle almost acts as the base of the letter, meaning that the lines are the sub element to make up the letter. The values for the lines are changeed the most so that it creates the form of the letter. I have realised that if I plan to use lines for my alphabet, I have to limit the amount of lines or else most of the parameters will make up of x and y positions. 

The three parameters per letter:

  "size" : radius of circle
  "offsetx" : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  "offsety": y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  "linex" : first line x axis
  "liney" : first line y axis
  "linex2" : second line x axis
  "liney2" : second line y axis
