## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this exercise, I decided to make the theme about siblings. I wanted to show the similarity in a set of sibling's facial features. However, I could only find this set of photos in my camera and  I realized that by pixelizing the photo, the details weren't so clear, so the features weren't that obvious. 

On the submitted work page, the first photo is my older brother, the second is my younger brother and the last is myself. 

Updated my thumbnail and preview image.
