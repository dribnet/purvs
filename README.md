## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


## Digital Nostalgia

Render time: about 5 Seconds

Note: The masks being applied to the 'incorrect' images is done on purpose to assist in my theme of glitchiness.

Theme: Photography-wise I was inspired by the board games that I was playing with my Mum over the lockdown. Thematically I wanted to create contrast between the old and the new, by presenting a range of board games (Scrabble, Cards, and Chess) in a modern, digital, and experimental manner, emphasizing the 'glitchy' appearance that is commonly associatiated with Video Games.

For my photos I wasn't really thinking about masks when I took them, and so my original idea was to use the monotone and flat colour of the blue card as a background to my objects, so that when I wrote the code, I would easily be able to seperate and target the background from the foreground.

I found the creative freedom that we had in this project really difficult, usually I find myself drawn to very structured and utilitarian styles with my coding project (hence my sine wave based clock, and isometric alphabet) and so I found using the randomness of the colours in a photo to create our outputs diffuclt. For this project I naturally went straight to the grid system from the Phoebe's tutorials, while I liked the effects I could create with this, I found that it was almost too structured, and the outputs always looked too close to the input photos, just at a lower resolution.

Originally my plan was to challenge myself with just using the shape of each 'pixel' to recreate the input photo, and to not rely on colour to represent forms. From this I started to look at the idea of drawing the output photo using just a singular line, I got this to work but it wasnt very visually interesting. However from my experiments with this, I got the idea to create a grid system, where each of the 'pixels' was instead a line that draws from the each side of the image, however had the vertices of each of the pixels it passed through, and could therefore contort to show the detail of the input image. In order to get each line contorting I (very imaginatively) added a parallax effect, where based on how far away the vertice was from the centre, and the brightness of the pixel from the input image was, the vertices would move towards the centre.

In one of my experiments with this effect I added a fill to the vertical lines, because each line wasn't a closed off shape the fill colour drew a straight line back up to the beginning vertice, and because the line was one entire shape, the fill colour was entirely just the colour of the beginning pixel. This created a fantastic cascading colour effect, and overall created this really nice glitchy and abstract look. I liked this look, however because I had stumbled onto it, I didnt want to use it for my final because that felt too easy, however this did inspire the direction that I took the output images in for my next commits.

At this point I also hadn't experimented with masks yet, and I had no idea how I was going to implement them. One of my worries with the masks was that because I was using a parallax effect to distinguish between the different brightness and therefore depth of each pixel, using a mask to put a different effect on certain areas would break the illusion of depth that I had created. I experimented with a few other uses of the parallax aside from the grid, but after some tutor feedback I went back to the grid. After some help I was able to draw custom shapes that slot into each 'square' made from the parallaxed grid. With individual shapes I could then add the correct colour to each part of the image. I did this but then I was back at my first problem of the images just looking low resolution, where the colour visually overwrote the parallax effect, as it made it too easy to identify what the objects were. I then went back and instead of filling each shape with the correct colour, I removed the grid, and set the stroke of each 'square' to the pixel colour, this looked better in my view, however the images were very dark, and the objects didn't massively jump out unless you really looked in close. Because I liked both of these outputs but they both had flaws, I chose to use the masks to use both of these effects, the stroke effect for the background, and the fill for the foreground. I liked this effect, but I didnt think it was quite as visually interesting as my previous 'glitchy' commit, my counter to this was switching up which masks where used for each image. This made the images feel a lot more organically 'broken' which I really like. I really like the look of the images where the mask overlaps with an area of the image 'changes depth' due to the parallax, it makes it look as though the colour is being wrapped around a 3d net. I like how the unique colours of each image come through, but don't dominate the image, and you can make out what the images are of, without relying on the colour.
