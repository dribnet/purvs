## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

april 3 - So my idea is to use characters (such as the chinese, japanese and korean text) as reference. I thought it would be interesting to try and recreate those types of characters for the project. I plan to add some ellipses to the characters as well to make it look a bit more interesting. I thought of this after looking at korean texts as they seem to have a lot of these 'O' like shapes in their characters. Might change colours and such later.

april 5 - I finished the letters and now I am currently trying to figure out what I want to do for the numbers. I could possibly go a simplistic look using either lines or ellipses to do this or I could try another approach such as checking out the characters for these numbers in the native text of either the chinese, japanese or korean.

april 6 - Starting the numbers. I decided to base it on the characters found on the chinese and japanese numbers. The first 3 are just 3 lines which is quite straight forward, then I plan to just do normal numbers for the rest. I will be trying to make them not intersect like the alphabet so that it can be seen as a number instead of just a weird looking letter. I also wanted to place a tiny circle just in case so that it can be recognized as a number instantly because the letters don't have any. It is just something to differentiate the 2 characters (alphabets and numbers). Its also just for some consistency in the numbers and because why not.

april 7 - Finished the numbers and the extra character/symbol at the end as well. I think it turned out pretty well. Now I will be focusing on making it look good or ok at the very least.

april 9 - Could not push my updated code for some reason so that took out a lot of my time. I will just change the words that automatically pop up in the exhibition html and call it a day. That will probably the last commit that I make since I've been quite put off with editing my code at home seeing what happened today.

Edit: Changed the background colour and colour of characters to make it look like neo-tokyo signs at night glowing and such. Also changed the words that shows up in the exhibition.html.

april 10 - Changed the interpolation just a tiny bit. Just delayed when it interpolated till it hits the 20,40 and 60 percent using an if and else to make it look like it speeds up rather than it slowly changing from one character to another. Changed how 3 looks so that the interpolation from 2 to 3 is not just a line popping up in the bottom.

april 12 - This is probably the last few tweaks I am going to do with the actual code. I added the ellipses behind the letters so that they don't just appear out of thin air. I thought about doing the same thing for 1, 2, 3 and 8 but it would be a little too difficult to do that without changing the characters them themselves and using the lines and ellipses I have available. I will just comment on the code before hand in and I should be ok.

Final Notes- Did the comments quickly. I tried to put as much information that I understood from the past week or so that I played around with it. Hopefully it is informative enough/is accurate to how it actually works.
