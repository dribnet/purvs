## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have changed my images to be places around Wellington, since the exhibition is placed in town I wanted to create images reflecting the city. 

My first image is to highlight Wellingtons hills and scenery, the second photo is within the stadium during a hurricanes game, my last photo is from the wharf to show the fishing culture.

Overall each photo has their own overall colour going from orange, green to blue to make them each unique. I am not sure if at this point it makes my images then feel disconnected. 

Developing further I may play with masking to explore my theme deeper to give my overall composition more meaning.

I edited the third image by having a rectangle tiled skie to make the crescent moon shape clear. I placed ellipses for the mountains and the ocean to give it a soft texture. for the boats I wanted them to having this smearing look to play on the wind pushing them.
