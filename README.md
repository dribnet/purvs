## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
COMMIT ONE <br/>
Attempted to add triangle that point towards the previous triangle. At the moment it doesn't work, which I suspect is due to how the script assigns variables. I will have to look into getting around this. <br/>
I should mention for a while now I have been fascinated by simple rules creating complex "life": like Conway's "the Game of Life" and Craig Reynolds "Boids". My first instinct way to overlay some static boid like shapes over an image of the Wellington Harbour - As a Landscape architecture major I have a great appreciation for Wellingtons waterfront and what it has done for world wide development in the public realm, which I may or may not elaborate further on. This would present some natural aspects to the view and could create a powerful image where colour is only shown in the boids. <br/>




The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
