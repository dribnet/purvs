## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

01/06/20 - Theme: 2020 Wellington New Years Festival
The images above are photos of the new years festival in Wellington 2020 processed with a lightly modified version of the p5.js Pointillism example.

I thought it would be a good idea to continue using the theme of the new years festival that happened this year before quarantine. It highlights a time where the Wellington community came together and created this event for anyone to come celebrate. Now would be the perfect time to theoretically apply these images to a billbaord because they are a reflection of the highlights early this year.
These images were just taken on my phone and I took them because they were the bright colourful objects that caught my attention.

Currently I am not too sure what I will end up with for the pixel design but these images have great poteintial to help create something cool! I have kept the pixel design in this version all the same and only changed the mask to prepare myself for this project.
My pixel design consists of:

Masked:
let pointSize = 5;
rect(x, y, pointSize+50, pointSize);

Unmasked:
let pointSize = 5;
rect(x, y, pointSize, pointSize);
