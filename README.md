Binary Clock

I decided to do a total redesign from my original sketch, one that would display time in a binary representation with LED-like lights. Similar functioning hardware based clocks have been made like the one here: https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/59e0/ 

I also wanted to try the image tag from the API and see the specifics of the function and handling of image positioning.  

Some alarm functionality is now built in. The objects need to be mapped to animate according to countdown and alarm durations.
