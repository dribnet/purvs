## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

here I added my first level of zoom detail - just a thinner line inside the original orange line that appears from zoom level 1 onwards. I think it emphasises some of the pretty ways the original lines cross over each other to create patterns, which is less obvious in the zoom level 0 because of the high stroke weight.
