SKETCH IDEA

I originally started sketching some ideas for human looking faces but I really didnt like how they looked and I didn't think my ideas would translate very well into code and more primative shapes so I played around with the idea of animal faces. I ended up with this idea to do bears which I want to do in a kind of cartoony style. So far I'm thinking I will have face width & height and mout curve as continuous variables and then ears, eyes, nose and the shape around the mouth as discrete variables with different shapes/styles. The sketch is really bad but hopefully it more or less communicates my starting idea.
