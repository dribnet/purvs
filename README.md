I've used the focusRandom() method to make sure that there are usually lots of leaves around the sprites, and usually more twigs than less.

I used the other method to lean the distribution of seasons towards summer: 50% of the time the sprite is a summer sprite, 25% of the time it's spring, 15% of the time it's winter and 10% of the time it's autumn. Also 90% of the time the eyes are open and 90% of the time the mouth is closed.
