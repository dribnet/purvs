## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Iteration 2 - So I played around with the code and all for the 3rd image (paper and sketch on desk) and it turned out great. The idea behind this is to create a sketch pencil effect onto the white paper and pencil case since those two objects are the objects to symbolize my theme of passionate. I reduced the density of the lines to make it less scribble to make it more appealing.
