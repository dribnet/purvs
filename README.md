## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I decided to change my last image as, though I liked the texture of the cat's fur, I think the composition and colour of this image fits better to the theme and the other images. The colour grade combined with the dog looking over her shoulder creates quite a nostalgic feel. Considering the image is of a pet who has now passed away, this nostalgic lookis exactly what I'm going for. I decided that unlike the other images, I wanted to have the lines of the image match the background as I think it fits better and furthers the sentimental feel. 

My theme is about people and their pets. My three images are of my partner and our cat, my mum and her dog, and my childhood pet. To me, pets are a big part of my family so I wanted to focus on them as I feel they often aren't represented as much.
