### Outrageous clock

This is the final version of my clock.

My process:
I started with the idea of mainly orbiting numbers but later decided to change my idea to a more realistic type of clock like idea where you are looking at the earth from the top and watching the moon go around the Earth with stars twinkling on the outer areas. My alarm is inspired by something like an earthquake to make the Earth shudder as the alarm goes off.
I've also got a day night cycle with the colour of the moon turning into a sun at day time.

How it works:
With the outer stars one full pulse equals one second
One full rotation of the moon equals one full minute
One full rotation of the white island equals one our
One movement of the islands equals one day
