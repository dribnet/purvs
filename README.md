This is a recommit because i forgot to change the preview thumbnail in the orginal commit

I am trying to use a secondary shape that could possibly act as a way to give form to strokes instead of just one simple silhouette blob making the letterforms

I was trying to have an adaptable second shape that can grow in size as it moved further away from the main shape. The problem being it slowed down the process so much, and ultimately the effect wasn't much different from just having the glow remain constant
