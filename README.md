## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I have completed my alphabet, Im really happy with the way it has turned out. I will probably edit and fix up some characters before hand in. I will also need to work on the animation, I plan on making it either fairly fast or very slow. I might make the animation slow if its changing to a vowel and fast otherwise.

After looking at how the transitions work I think I might create fast moving transition for the first 50% and then slowly combine in the second half. Some of my letters seem to dissapear and reapear suddenly when I look at the transitions (O to L). I wanted to fix this and create a more smooth transition but I think it makes the letters more buuble like as if in an instant the bubble pops and something knew is in its place. The other characters have a more smooth interaction like bubbles touching and blending into one or remaining seprate while touching. I really like this effect.

I also want the default character to look like a ! Beacuse Its cute a fun bubble symbol.
