### Draft of Sand Clock

This is my draft of the Sand Clock. I plan to use the falling sand effect as the background, and several "containers" on the screen. Some of the containers will fill the sand so that gives the numbers. I also want to create the animation of sand in containers slowly grows from the bottom to the top to express the pass of time.
