## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

I created a black and white silhouette of some symbols that relate to the letters. I originally wanted to create a bubbly texture and make it more rounded but through experimenting with the base code from sketch.js and looking at the black and white sillhouette from the type me, type me not example on blackboard. I plan to create one or two more ellipses to make the shapes more understandably letters however I do like the minimal, moon-like shapes I have created thus far.
