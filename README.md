### clock alarm

This is the final iteration of my clock, the colours are no longer over powering or plain. when the alarm is activated the pattern on the clock face spins at the speed milliseconds are counted which creates a cool effect that is really hard to miss. the time is synced correctly now witht he hour hand acting as a 12 hour clock and the circle acting more as a 24 hour indicator. 
I had alot of trouble initially syncing the time to be accurate but it was fixed by moving the angleMode into the draw function from the st up function. this fixed the probably immediatly and stopped the animations from being so jittery and out of sync. another problem I occured was the terminal commiting which has caused my assignment to be out of order in my gist page.
