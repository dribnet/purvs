## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

I have started working on my alphabet (in draw_letters.js and letters.js) creating symbols for the first 6 letters. I deceided using only circles will create more unique shapes and I wanted to continue with that however the E and F seem very similar so I may have to go for a more symbolic look. I also think these will clash with P and R. I changed the background colour to red in order to see where my ellipses are. The background will be black in the final. Updated preview and thumbnail image too.
