# PART 1
## Ideation Sketch (v0)
Looking over my idea from PS3 I don't think I want to go in that direction for this problem set. While the kaleidoscope effect is really interesting and provides a kind of fractal design suitable for this, I want to try something new in a style more suited to still images, since the effect my PS3 provides I think is only really effective in animation.
Until I have a new idea though I have made a sketch based on PS3, which involves different versions of my hand-in. Zooming in the patterns will become more complex and kaleidoscopic, as with what actually happens in my code with the expanding circles.
