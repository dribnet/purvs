This is my final version of the clock. My initial inspiration is from galaxy. The rotation of those circles can reflect four elements of time, millisecond, second, minute and hour. 

For the final version, I keep polishing my idea to make it more identifiable. The radius of most outer circle of each element will change each millisecond in order to imitate the blinking of the stars in the sky. And they will change their own color through the time. 

When the alarm turns on, it will show different version of the clock. I was trying to make it more comparable, like colors and the number of circles. It will become a more minimalistic look when the alarm is turning on.
