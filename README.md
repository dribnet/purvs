## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

Nearly finished my design, added in some slider features for the training including: the mouth, teeth, eyes, eye color, and the cheeks. I'm liking my design more now, but might still try to add a bit more before handin. Need to fix some issues with the cheeks and eyebrows for certian images that cause they to go off the face, and it doesn't look good.
