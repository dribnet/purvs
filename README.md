## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theses images are potos I took quite a while ago, I'm just using them as fill ins at the moment and they will probably change. I played around with the maps to see what different looks they can give and followed one of the example of code to change from the default look.
Not sure if I like it at the moment but it is interesting trying things out.
