## Letters
Each letter is composed out of two sinus curves wich are always connected to each other.
## Numbers
I tried that the numbers are drawn incomplet but that you still could recognize them. 

##Parameters
###The parameters per letter:
- heightY: defines the height of the curve
- widthX: defines the width of the curve
- length: defines the length of the sinus curve in one direction
- Blength: defines the length of the sinus curve in to the other direction
- offsetX: offstetX is there to move the curve along the X-Axis
- offsetY: offstetY is there to move the curve along the Y-Axis
- rotation_angle: rotates the curve 

###Parameters for the second curve wich have the same meanings as the one from the first curve.
- heightY1: defines the height of the second curve
- widthX1: defines the width of the second curve
- length1: defines the length of the second sinus curve in one direction
- Blength: defines the length of the second sinus curve in to the other direction
- offsetX1: offstetX is there to move the second curve along the X-Axis
- offsetY1: offstetY is there to move the second curve along the Y-Axis
- rotation_angle1
