## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
I've developed my images a bit more, I'm really happy with the effects the grey masks are bringing. Through rotating the rects that make up the background in input 1 & 2, I had quite a lot of empty space that was just made up by the background colour. But now using the mask, I've been able to fill this space while keeping the rects rotated for that abstract, movement effect. Input 2 has definitely been the most challenging as the girl in the photo did not look 'centre of attention', she was smaller and more in proportion with the nature next to her, having the green effect over her did bring more attention to her but it needed more going on. I hope I've done this somewhat here without the image becoming too chaotic. I feel like my images are almost like an interdimension between the digital world and the naturistic world, that's what I'm going with for my theme. I'm actually quite happy with what my theme's become, it's super out there and interesting. Definitely more up for individual perception, it is what you see it as. Still some more adjustments to do before hand on.
