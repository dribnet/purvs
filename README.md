## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

###Getting Started:

So I have had an incredibly rough few weeks, life wise so sadly I am only getting around to this project now. I have been thinking about how I would like to approach this project however, which I will go into more detail about in my next project. For now this is my first attempt. I have only rendered one because of how long it is taking to render, however this iteration was more to get my head around the code anyways. Which I think I have done now.
