## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process

For my first commit I picked images of scenery and landscapes so I wanted to explore images of people and to se if the same code used for the scenery images could be applied but I found out that the facial features had a lot of fine detail so I had to adjust the shapes and play around with the code to get a clear image of a face. I also changed the width and the height of the ellipses and I decided the image looked best when the ellipses were going horizontal because when I had the rectangle it look blurry and it was a hard image to distinguish.
