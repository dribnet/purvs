## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I originally wanted to have the two 'layers' of this map both be the same pattern. My first sketch took this idea with starting zoomed in on a pink pattern, and zooming out to reveal another version of it.

I began by just putting my existing pattern into the framework. This worked quite easily, and I could quickly add all the elements of my pattern.

I then experimented with different colours when zooming in, and decided on the original colours from my first sketch - just having them increase in opacity as you zoom. At this point, I also decided to stick with the zooming in, rather than zooming out like I had originally planned. This was just easier as working through the code natrually made me think of way to manipulate the pattern while zooming in rather than out.

Moving on to animation, I wanted to keep with a similar sort of motion from ps3, but making things a bit more random to break up the grid a bit. Other than making things move offset to one another, I also decided to have some elements still. This just made the grid less obvious than having everything move together.

Finally, I added in an extra layer beyond the colours changing. After realising my original plan would be difficult to implement, I still wanted to have some kind of extra pattern appear. To do so, I simply added in a grid of shadowed dots. I thought this was a nice way to add in some extra texture that still stuck with the style of the first pattern.
