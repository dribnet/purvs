Copied Tom's "grid offsets" sketch.js code, and adjusted circleSize, squareSize, and elementSpacing.

I did try just increasing the sizes at first, and it looked interesting, a bit like a low-res painting.
However, the right eye was half-covered by gray, so I lowered the elementSpacing.

I noticed the smaller the elementSpacing, the more distinctly the render resembled the photo. So I might try lowering the spacing even more and see what happens.



I need to take some vertical photos, remake the mask, and get some more subject material.
