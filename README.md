## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

My initial idea is based off my ps3 design. I will be converting it to 2D. When you zoom in, the swirls will be made up of little asteroids or planets and the stars will have more introcate and geometric detailing to them.

To further this idea, I may reinclude the planets as 2D shapes that also gain more detail when zoomed in. I'd also like to play around with the colour scheme a bit more.
