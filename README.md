Mockup of Alphabet

In the first stage of my creation I have made a mockup on illustrator to see what the letters are going to look like and hash out any letters that are too similar or that don't work.

The three parameters I plan to have per letter:
  * `X Line` : The X position of the vertical line
  * `Y top box` : The Y width of the top box
  * `Y bott box` : The Y width of the bottom box
