## PS4 MDDN 342 2018
first readme

In my example I am starting with the classic 10print commodore
screen. My idea is to expose an additional level of maze as
a person zooms in closer. In my case, the additional maze
elements will appear behind the original layer. The smaller
mazes will also have more structure and less contrast than
the largest layers.

This README should be updated as the code changes. Replace
this placeholder text and use this
README as a design journal to record your process.
Be sure to use complete sentences,
and you can reference your sketch which will appear above.
The explanation should be short but complete, roughly 100 words.

Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
preview.png (960x500) and thumbnail.png (230x120).
