## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


I am trying to get a similar effect from the example code but with triangles which I cannot seem to get working. 
  * `size` : radius of the second rect
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rect relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rect relative to the first one
