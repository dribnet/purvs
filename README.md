### Episode 07 the clock thus far

This is the current result of my clock creation, which will be further updated into the original concept of a changing pattern, once this is figured out i can finally start working on the alarm feature of this clock.


(things to improve)
-unique movement in regards to time
-effective layout of the clock
-unique alarm mechanism
-make it more interesting
