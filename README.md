## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### Adam Leach

 

For this project, I wanted to create a clock which showed my love for graffiti and street art. I am extremely happy with how my design has turned out, and I think that i have well surpassed what I wanted to do in terms of my sketch. I believe that it outdoes it by miles. Originally, I wasn't going to include background, but i believed that the clock needed something more and it wasn't complete without it. I also decided to include a seconds timer that has a good bit of size in order to take up more space. It provides something else for the viewer to look at other than the main clock. Something that i think is quite effective is the paint drips. The drips use obj.millis to control how fast they fall. I think it is very effective having a constant dynamic with my clock. Makes it a bit more interesting, and the drips work with my theme.
