## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I am yet to figure out how to create more layer colours but in the meantime, I thought it would be interesting to revesre the mask as the other styles I have used the white on the flowers and black on the background. I think this has made a really interesting look and gives interest between the outputs without needing to change the code


The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
