Mockup of Alphabet

Created the Alphabet inside sketch.js. Will need to do some tweaking to make them look like my mockup. Also need to make decisions on the  box colour being fully invisible or barely visible. All in all this is the least amount of parameters I could conjure with the code.

The three parameters I plan to have per letter:
  * `X Line` : The X position of the vertical line
  * `Y top box` : The Y width of the top box
  * `Y bott box` : The Y width of the bottom box
