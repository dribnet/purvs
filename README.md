FINAL

Pattern:
	My pattern was inspired by drawing patterns in my gridded math book back in high school. The way you would make patterns like this was by drawing lots of straight lines, changing the x and y origin and destination of each line in a certain way, and the way they overlapped made interesting curves and shapes. I always found it fascinating that straight lines could make curved shapes like this, and thought that the process would be made a lot eaiser with code, which it did,
	
	The pattern kind of reminded me of waves, so I coloured the lines a light blue. To create variation I added subtle whirlpools, which were made with repeating triangles, instead of repeating squares like the rest of the pattern. I quite like the effect of this pattern; your eyes want to keep finding and following the lines.
	
Landscape:
	This was inspired by retrowave art and a project that I did for creative coding last year, where we had to code a skyline. I always love watching sunsets, especially the colours. I also wanted to add some more interest to the sky, so I added planets, stars and shooting stars.
	
	I've used noise to create the mountains of the landscape, and simple shapes to create the sun, shooting stars and planets. There is also a random number of planets and shooting stars. They also have random sizes and the planets have a random colour and number of rings.
