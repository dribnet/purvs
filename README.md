I experimented with triangles, quads and custom shapes, but found what worked best with ellipses were standard rectangles. there are a lot of different types of small patterns you can find within the overall wallpaper. this includes small hexagonal spaced diamonds, and waves. 

I also began experimenting with colour to giev the wallpaper more life, as I was finding black and white very dull. the hues of red and blue mixed together create some good blending with the transparency.
