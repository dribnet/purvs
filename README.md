## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I wanted to play around with the colour, stroke and transparency. For this design I changed the colours and made the stroke bigger and the line transparent. I'm not sure about the transparent stroke for the line because even though it matches with the circles, it doesn't match with the outside line. 


The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
