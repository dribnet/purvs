## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Shrunk the rectangle on the 'n'.
Shifted the rectangle on the '2' to the left more.

Decided to make every number except for '0', be the same height for consistency.
I then modified the '2' since there was more space.

Shifted one of the ellipses on '9', because it was hanging off the right side of the rectangle.

Decided to have the middle ellipse of '3' on the middle of the bar so it lines up.



At this point in time, after much consideration, I have decided to break the rule to have all numbers be the same height, by making '8' touch the ceiling.
This was done so I could have the middle of the number be in the middle of the line, and still maintain even spacing.




I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
