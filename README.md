## Cells


My design has morphed into a more cellular level map, showing the cells of a liquid as it flows. The connections and bonds gain more detail as you zoom further in, eventually revealing a nucleus.

The colours represent a cool, liquid substance, that makes it more calming and allows the busy design some control.
