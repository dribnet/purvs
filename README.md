## PS1 MDDN 242 2017

Two quick ideas I had for project 1. I liked the idea of a geometric 3d clock that Andreas Gysin made (https://vimeo.com/9414302). I also liked the idea of introducing colour in the way that Mike Bostockâ€™s Polar Clock does (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c150b717e18d387e1b98). I tried to combine these.


Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
