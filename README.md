 I have developed my idea into 26 letters and 10 digits.

 I struggled with some of the letters. For example ,J ,R, S , U . I have tried my best to organize the shapes. One sector has stroke and another without stroke. I think it will contribute to share the similar element and make difference between letters.

coding:  posx,posy,pos2x,pos2y contorl the position of the shapes. aecE,arcE,arcS2,arcE2 control the angle of the sectors.size1 and size2 to control size of the sectors.

color use: I change the color into dark background and bright letters. I  think it is much better for visulization.
