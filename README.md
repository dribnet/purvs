<h?>NEONVOLT</h?>

My typeface is called "NEONVOLT". It reflects the synthwave inspired neon glow and the sharp and angular geometric shape design.

My typeface consists of a geometric custom shape that morphs and adapts to create unqiue letterforms. The custom shape uses many of the parameters to manipulate the location of each vertices. The remaining parameters are used to translate and maniuplate the overall shape for both the blue and orange version of the shape. Using two versions of the custom shape i am able to complete complicated letterforms with fewer variables. The original custom shape can be seen in the default character. 

<b>Process</b>

The inspiration for the typeface came from a number of places included this <a href="https://spin.co.uk/work/bbc-creative"> identity </a> by SPIN UK and generative design concepts such as sediment mars by Alessandra Villaamil found <a href="https://programmingdesignsystems.com/shape/procedural-shapes/index.html"> Here </a>. Originally I wanted to explore 3 dimensional isometric space (examples of these attempts can be found in previous commits). The limitations of the brief pushed me in a two dimensional direction (however a true generative and adaptive 3 dimensional design is something i would be eager to explore). The previously mentioned limitations however led me to consider a stronger symmetrical core shape that evidentally reflected the limitations of the code. This realisation was a turning point for project as embraced the angularity of the letterforms in more abstract ways and I began looking at synthy aesthetic influences that ranged from TRON to Daftpunk


<b>Animation</b>

The intention for the interpolation between letterforms was to take advantage of the singular shape design and how the forms can naturally morph between each other. The goal was to make an almost organic flow which creates an interesting juxtapostion with the geomtric design.
