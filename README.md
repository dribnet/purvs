I've been trying to experiment alot more with this image.

I've tried playing around with different ellipse shapes, and playing around with what the mask draws and where.

For now, I'm taking a break on this iteration. I think background gaps shining through with white spots is really cool, and adds to my theme/asthetic of memory fuzz.

However, I'm not happy with the drawing of the FirstAidKit as it is, so it'll give me the opportunity to experiment with different coding methods.
