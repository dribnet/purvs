## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Adding Extra Details

I have used Phoebe's grid code in this experiment. It has made the rendering another few seconds slower than before, but still renders less than 8 seconds. I think I'll continue refining this grid like code because it made my background more interesting. It also helped the actual leaves to stand out more with the contrasting circles and lines used in my black and grey mask. This contrast is ideal because my theme focuses on highlighting the details of the plants leaves - accentuating and appreciating the beauty of nature. I like that its continuing to have a coloured pencil style, but the circles and lines adds an abstract feel which I like. I think the use of arcs really helped make my images more detailed while giving that coloured pencil style feel.
