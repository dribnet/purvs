PLAYING WITH COLOUR

I thought it would be cool to desaturate my background so that it highlights the girl more since she is the main focus and with some of the images the background sometimes got it the way, now that I have adjusted the background it has good contrast and makes the girl more clear. I feel like I would like it to still have some colour but wasn't sure how to bring back some colour so that is something.
