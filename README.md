## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My design idea is to create all the letters using just three simple triangles in different arrangements as shown ion the sketch. The letters will atempt to look like the traditional alphabet in order to be recognizeable by anyone who knows the english alphabet.

This means the parameters per letter will be:
Triangle_1_location 
Triangle_2_location 
Triangle_3_location 
Triangle_1_rotation 
Triangle_2_rotation 
Triangle_3_rotation
Triangle_1_scale 
Triangle_2_scale 
Triangle_3_scale
