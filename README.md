This version shows the beginnings of my landscape. I've refined the starter code given in class to work for the aesthetic I'm going for and match my pattern style. I've removed the polygons and started to add in some statements that generate shapes randomly. I'm now working on replacing those shapes with landscape features that vary in density and size.
