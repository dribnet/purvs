This program draws either a wallpaper, or a landscape.
You can press the spacebar to switch between the modes.
You can click on the canvas to generate a new wallpaper or landscape.

--Wallpaper--
The wallpaper uses simple rects and lines
to create a detailed pattern. It uses the same shapes
as the landscape, but colored and sized differently.

The color scheme is neon and bright, randomly changing between 3 color schemes.
taking inspiration from future japanese night lighting. The goal of this wallpaper
is to create an aesthetically pleasing composition using simple shapes to create
a complex pattern.

--Landscape--

The landscape uses a similar minimalist aesthetic to the wallpaper, but is this time
more representative of an actual environment, and is focused on conveying symbols that represent
it from a top-down view.
It uses simple shapes to represent things like trees and rocks. Each type of terrain
has its own probability of spawning, which is changed each time a new landscape is generated.

The chances of each terrain type spawning is displayed on the left.
