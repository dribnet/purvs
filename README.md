## expressionist faces - final
my final design for the parameterised collection. inspired by expressionist artists like kandinsky, basquiat and rothko.

the weighted selection is in the face colour, inclusion of pupils and whether the face is flipped on the y axis.
pupils and flip both have a 70% chance of occurring.

the colours are distributed as follows:
black: 1%
orange: 18%
purple: 19%
blue: 33%
yellow: 39%

the continuous values are rotation, face proportions, eye spacing, nose width, mouth width, and opacity in the background faces. i used focusedRandom for opacity and rotation values but i found that leaving all the other values at maximum randomness created a more expressionist feeling in the variation between faces.
