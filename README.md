Final.

My first portrait is of a lego face. I wanted to do something simple just to get a handle on how to code again. My second portrait is of Rick from Rick and Morty, which was more challenging to make. I wanted a clean art style. 

For the three drawing styles, I wanted to have quite different faces so I could try different styes and so I wouldn't have a problem picking if they were quite similar. However, I did want to stick to quite bold, clean colours and style. The first face is of a cat, the second of a glowing alien and the third a tree sprite. I chose the go with the tree sprite, as I felt that I could randomise quite a lot of the parameters. It was also the cutest.

When randomising, I picked out the the amount of leaves and twigs a sprite could have, and then later added a random parameter for how big the eyes and twigs could be so there was more variation. I also added different kind of sprites - their colour palette changes if they are summer, winter, spring or autumn. This is picked randomly also. 

For distribution, I wanted to pick a certain season and have the palettes lean towards that season. I picked out summer for this, so the majority of sprites are summer ones, then spring, then a smaller amount of winter and then a smaller amount are autumn. The sprites also looked quite bare with less leaves, so I leaned the distribution more towards having more twigs and leaves. The eyes and mouth are 90% of the time open and closed respectively. The sizes of things I left random. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with the end product. I stuck to what art style I wanted, and achieved a good spread of variation. I would maybe however have the dominant season be picked out randomly so it isn't always summer.
