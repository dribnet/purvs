# Initial Concept

My initial idea for this project is to create a girls face, with a high level of customization available. Most of the sliders will create a transition between a simple design, to a more detailed and over the top face. Id like to create sliders that can change the length of the hair, how curly the hair is and how detailed the eyes are. 

The hair sliders are relatively straightforward, while the eyes will transition from simple black dots to detailed big eyes. 

I'd also like to include a slider for the number of accessories worn in the hair, changing the number to add in bows, flowers and clips.
