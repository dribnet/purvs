## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

"Pixels Of Space"

My overall theme for these images is space and astrophotography. I chose this because outside of Uni and Work, my hobby is to take images of space such as Nebulae and Galaxies. I think it would be cool to use my images because these objects in space all have wildly different shapes, sizes and most importantly colors.

I found this project was quite difficult in some areas in terms of my own creativity. A lot of the experimenting I had been doing felt like it wasnt too much in the way of changing my images. Because the objects in my images are so detailed, I felt like I couldnt experiment with larger 'pixels' else I would risk taking away the detail and making them look ugly and weird. I did feel restrained with the experimenting that I could do because of this. I would have liked to push the weirdness of using different shapes, grids and other effects but I felt like they were destroying my image and people wouldnt have been able to tell what the subject was.

On the coding side of things it was fairly simple, using the ideas and information that we have learnt throughout this trimester, getting the result that I wanted and imagined was pretty simple even though I feel like I couldnt push the coding side of things too far without breaking the images. When I was making my shapes for the 'pixels' I wanted to keep it with my theme, hence why I made the star shapes via a function, I do think this make for a cool effect inside my masks.

Of the three, I would have to say that image 2 is my favourite with the "Orion Nebula". I think it looks the cleanest while still keeping those awesome details from the original image.
