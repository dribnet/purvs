sketching ideas (part 1)

I want it to feel like you are traveling deeper, through the strands.

Color lerp strands juxtoposed with the very solid looking strands, already help add a new dimension. 

When the user zooms in, they will be 'unlocking' layers of color, and learning about how the structure grew over time.
