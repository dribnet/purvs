## Wall patinting Art

My theme is the wellington wall painting art.

Wall painting is not really common in china which is really surprised me when I come to wellington. I would like to using piexls to redefine this art.

For choosing of the painting, I take several photos around wellington city, and choose 3 of them have same color base. They are all blue but still shows a different styles. One of them is a kind of cartoon style with black out line, another one is a more abstract mural. The other one is more figurative. Last two does not really have out line.

For the mask, I cut the out line and some of the mian body part out. Using black and white to making masks. I use circles to bulid the basic part of these pictures,and the rectanlges to make the white part, which can gives every element a kind of  jagged edge. This jaggde edge is effective which change these painting into a style of 2D pixel game. 

For the 2nd one I give the edge part a dark color to make it a clear out line, which gives a better effect and make every pictures into the same style. Since I use small circles in most part of the pictures, the combination gives small dots in the background, which gives them a 'canvas', make the pixel feeling stronger.
