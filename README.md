I couldnt get BLUR to work without destroying the framerate, so i decided to take a different path. I have layered the letters and used BLENDMODE() and the alpha variable in RBG to control transparency in the colours. This has created a cool looking retro style mixxed in with the colour switching which at its randomised values fits the art style well due to it looking ""buggy"" and jumpy.
