## Powers of 10 PRINT

I have got my layers and zoom levels sorted:

0,1 Grid
2,3 Small dots appear
4,5 Bigger dots
6,7 Small white dots appear in background
8,9 Detail in red and black dots appear

I've noticed that it takes ages to load the page everytime it zooms in. Not sure if it's just mine or it's just what it is.
