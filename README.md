### Bubble Clock

This is my final clock. The clock runs on a for loop drawing the circles and text on top of it. There is also a sinwave that allows the balls to bob up and down. There are if statements as well as variables to allow the jump animation and the alarm going off animation.

I got my inspiration from watching Vector based animations on pinterest whilst i was researching. I quite liked the lighter faded colour palettes that were present in them so i tried to emulate that in my clock. Overall im happy with what i have produced and have learned alot of new coding techniques throughout the process.

If i were to re-create the clock, i would change the colours and add some more idle animations. I would also change the alarm going off animation.
