### Outrageous clock

I am trying to figure out how to make the sun go in a circle and increase and decrease the acceleration. 

The hour will represent the sun, moon, and change colours of the background. eg. when its night its black when its day its blue.

Minutes will be birds.
Seconds maybe people.
Millis, I have no clue.


When its night the sun will change into the moon
When its day it will change into the sun.
