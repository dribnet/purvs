## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I've been slowly making progress with the letters, and I've changed the sizing, and made it so that I can alter the ellipse horizontally and vertically. So far I have 10 parameters, and I don't really plan on adding more, unless I have to.

what I have currently for the letter A, which are quite self explanatory

"sizeX": 74,
"sizeY": 74,
"offsetx": 11,
"offsety": 58,
"curveX": 12.5,
"curveMidX": -102,
"curveMidY": 135,
"curveY": 44,
"translateX": 38,
"translateY": 56

I'm still making my way through the alphabet, and once I finish the letters, I will begin the interpolation part, and then finish with the polshing and refining colours and general aesthetics.

After working further on my letters, I realize that I am going to need to add in another ellipse, as I need it to make more complex letters like M, W, Z, and S. This will add 4 more parameters.
