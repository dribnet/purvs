## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2
Currently the majority of my typeface has the core shape of the form. I do have to go in and adjust most so that they are more consistent. Most of the inconsistency comes with the lack of following the bounding box. 

I am playing with the final look of the custom shape. 


My typeface consists of geometric custom shapes that morphs and adapts to create unqiue letterforms. The custom shape uses many of the parameters to manipulate the location of each vertices. The remaining parameters are used to translate and maniuplate the overall shape for both the blue and orange. Using two versions of the custom shape i am able to complete complicated letterforms with fewer variables. 

The concept for movement is to eventually create an organic movement and shifting between different letterforms.
