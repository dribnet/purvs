## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Finally figured out github issues, able to upload sketch and start on the alphabet. The plan now is to make a ring type font inspired by the Olympic logo. Want to make rings transparent so i can see overlap and create illusions of layering. Using a simple colour palette to try not to over complicate the design for now. I want to modify the interpolation so that the rings move around in an orbit as opposed to linear transformation.
