Final README - "Awe"

Development

In my early commits I was using some photos I took in Hong Kong to get my head around the code. My initial concept was focused on sustainability and showing the damage we are doing to the environment. I planned to take photos around Wellington, of the botanic gardens, waterfront and city, and mask out the trees, leaves, and the water to show the impact we are doing to the environment. 

Photos

After doing some digging in my camera roll I found these images I took of my sister, which all had similar colour schemes and were in natural environments. After working with the code I decided to change my theme slightly, and focus instead on the beauty of nature. 

Masking

I have four different masked out areas in each image. 

For areas of natural elements, I have used ellipses with stroke only. This creates a kind of wild appearance, and makes it look like nature is 'taking over'/ growing. Additionally I thought it was nice that a circle is used as a symbol for 'the circle of life'. 

I have masked out the figure and used the rect function with a strong black stroke, to semi obscure the details of the figure, like they are a void/ a bad thing that is detrimental to the world around it, but also to show that they are unimportant in the grand scheme of things.

I have masked out man made elements in each image with a grey mask, and used rect, with a dark grey stroke. Each consecutive image has increasing man made elements in it. Initially I considered using an image with buildings as my last image to show this more, but it didn't fit as well with the other two images. Like with the figure, these elements are not detailed to show that they are unimportant. 

I have masked out the top area of each image with a lighter grey, and used the line function with a  purple stroke to create the 'sky'. This gives them a surreal and other worldly feel - to show how small people are in comparison to nature. I also decided to mask out some lines in the sky of each picture - either where the clouds roughly are, or where the hills are in the actual photo. This helps balance out the image and also gives it a more graphic look. 

Summary

Overall I am happy with how this problem set has turned out. I feel like the images work well as stand alone images and as a part of a series. I particularly like the strong constrast in the images, and I feel like my theme has come through fairly well. s
