## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final Project:

In Greek mythology, Narcissus walked by a pool to drink some water. He fell in love with his reflection and killed himself because he could not satisfy his desire. He slowly pined away and was transformed by the nymphs into a narcissus flower. I think of this story when i take these inverted photos.My project is to present the "narcissus personality". "My reflection is shining in my eyes". The actions of the three images(stand, move , then walk) can also talk a story.

During the design process, I set three lay out for the images to highlight the reflections. Background is consist of dense rects(nofill) to reduce the details. The portrait keep more details( ellipse fill with pixel color) . The reflection are rects with goldern stroke and pixel colors. (I also tried with goldern fullfill and ellipse with pixel color.And i had also fixed the white edge between body and the background.However, it can't be downloaded at the last step.But It still render in this way) I think the reflections are shining which is i expect.
