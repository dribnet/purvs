Exhibition


I edited the exhibition code to fit my alphabet. 
The words I entered into the swapWords variable are:
  OLDFOGEY -The name of the font. Old Fogey is an old nickname for someone who is a bit conservative or 'square', and I thought it would be a fun thing to name my square font.
   SQUARE  -'Square Font',
    FONT   -Describes the font.
  MAIAHILL -My name.
  LETS GO? -A prompt to start typing. Also shows off the '?'.
