### 01/04/22 - CREATING THE EDITOR

In today's class, I set up the editor so that I could use it to help create the rest of my letters. I then started to come up with a few more letters, including the P, H, U and O. The editor was very helpful for this as it made it easier to play around and try some different positions. I had to change my variable for the line angle to go from 0 to 1 rather than having a string in an if statement to get the editor to work.

I also did a bit of research into Piet Mondrian and the De Stijl art movement to try and get some more information on the principles of the style. The use of block colours and lines is somewhat random but also has an abstract meaning, which is something I should think about with y letter forms. I also found that some pieces seem to have more of a line base whereas others are made up more of rectangles. I am not 100% sure what direction I want to head in next but I might change the line to be a yellow or white rectangle to add another shape. The shapes could also be used as lines if given a height of 0.

The 11 parameters per letter:
  * `squareX` : x offset of the red square
  * `squareY` : y offset of the red square
  * `squareSize` : the length of the sides of the red square
  * `rectX` : x offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectY` : y offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectWidth` : width of the blue rectangle
  * `rectHeight` : height of the blue rectangle
  * `lineX` : x offset of the start point of the line
  * `lineY` : y offset of the start point of the line
  * `lineLength` : length of the line
  * `lineAngle` : orientation of the line (0 for vertical and 1 for horizontal)

My next step will be to continue making my letterforms and to do some more research to find out what direction I want to head in.
