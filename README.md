## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

10/06/20

I have now really finished my custom pixel assignment!
After feedback from Phoebe in the presentation this morning I realised that I need to accentuate the colours that were already popping out in my scene unintentially. Upon analysis of what was creating these colours I realised that this was caused by some pixels being seemingly colours in areas of my photos that were very bright.
So what I did is I found the values of these colours and then made an if statement to find these colours but added a lot more range around the general colour so I could catch all the different tones of colour. Once the colours were caught I used a function called water colour which is a see through sphere blob and my brushstroke function to simulate a brush stroke still being visible on the canvas of a paitning.
My favourite output is definitely output two, I love the colours that I have used and I think this would look really cool on a billboard. Although output_3 is the most successful in looking like a painting I feel.
Th blue colour is the only colour that wasn't in photos much at all that I added more of. I added this blue colour because of that reason; I wanted to make my outputs seem less like the photo and for another reason I thought that this blue colour worked in all my outputs, ecspeciall the 2nd one, with the red, and green.

To clarify my idea is to show what I saw when I was younger going on bush walks and express this in an aesthetically pleasing way. I think we tend to view things not only in a photographic way because a lot of time's when we look at something there is emotion attached or we are focusing on one thing and can't see anything else. In using code to manipulate my photo's I wanted them to carry more emotion than they did in the photos to represent how I felt when I was going for bush walks with my family and I think all my outputs express this quite well.

The hardest part about this project for me was balancing out making the photo's in a painterly while also maintaining detail and interest in parts that I needed to show. That is why I have so many different layers in my sketch.

The first output has a mask colour that is different than the rest because this was the only way I could figure out how to highlight the tree without it dissapearing into the background when I added in the different colours.
