## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Alphabet updated up to the letter D. The next ones going forward a bit of a challenge at present. Still need to do some more thinking.

Finally managed to sort out the code. I had to add another rounded rectangle which has the same colour as the background, which is cutting through the first rectangle in order to form the letter C.


Still trying to sort out my code to draw the letters in the form I want. I'm using a line and rounded rectangle to draw the letters. At the moment my code doesn't seem to be working so I need to figure out a way forward so that I can update my thumbnail and sketch.



First time working on this Project 2. I changed a few things about the sketch using the same code. Changed darkBlue fill to pink. Changed space between letters from 250 to 200. Changed strokeWeight from 4 to 6.
