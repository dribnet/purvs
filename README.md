I have edited the mask colours so they work better, with the colour specificially set to 150 for the grey and adjusting the area. I have also edited one of the photos to be darker and more desaturated which emphasizes the scene. I would like the make the face blur more blurry and probably greyer. I am currently trying to work out how to run it a second time with just the circles so the circles draw over the top. I have got to this point in the code but the second loop is still making rectangles on top. I will have a look at Tom's tutorial on making second passes and see if I can fix his.
