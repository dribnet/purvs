### Current Cloud Hop Clock

This version of the clock shows an almost complete version. The Dino animations framework is complete and Dino now has 3 standby animations, blinking, turning, and sleeping. This development has also lead to the completion of another major feature. The alarm animations have finally being added to the clock and now Dino will play a saxophone when the alarm goes off :D. I may add more to the general alarm to make the alarm more obvious that it is going off, but for now it works and is a major step done. 

Other updates included tidying up the code as it has been a little while since that was done. This included shuffling of functions and removal of useless variables, as well as some more comments. I have also done some small tweaks to background clouds speeds and opacities.

I also updated Debug, which was very useful in getting the alarm animations to work.

From here I believe that the remaining features are:
	- Dino jumping to each cloud with a small particle effect
	- The ability to set an alarm through dino.
	- Some more Cloud art
	
As well as general polish and tweaks to the clock, as well as the code readability like before.
