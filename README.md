### Windows 95 Clock With Alarm

I updated my clock to have an alarm, and made other changes such as having a method to make buttons and the windows. The X in the top right corner when pressed now also results in a pop up window. I also fixed the justification of numbers in the loading bars when they are double-digit. I updated the text at the top of the main window to reflect the status of the alarm. When the alarm goes of the display is filled with “Alarm!” windows.
