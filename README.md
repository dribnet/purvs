## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme2:

In Greek mythology, Narcissus walked by a pool to drink some water. He fell in love with his reflection and killed himself because he could not satisfy his desire. He slowly pined away and was transformed by the nymphs into a narcissus flower. I think of this story when i take these inverted photos.My project is to present the "narcissus personality". "My reflection is shining in my eyes". The actions of the three images(stand, move , then walk) can also talk a story.
