## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are of random pedestrians around the Wellington CBD and outskirts. I've decided to base my theme around "Urban Isolation" - the idea that despite us being constantly surrounded by people at all times in cities, many are made to feel alone nonethless. It is as if the constant influx of people depersonalizes us and make us feel that much less in touch with everybody around us.

Thus when picking my subjects I wanted to focus on concepts of distances, through rack focus, as well as portraying them in contrast to something. This could be other groups of people or large empty spaces - anything that further emphasizes my theme.

The code utilizes a simple background grid so far, and simply blurs out the foreground. Although I'm working on making the code more complex, as well as making the foreground stand out more from the background
