I am pleased with the animation. I think the transformation of the cubes from one alphabet to another is really interesting and it looks like an alphabet puzzle maze.

The parameters per letter:
  * `x1` : x offset of the first cube 
  * `y1` : y offset of the first cube 

  * `x2` : x offset of the second cube relative to the first one
  * `y2` : y offset of the second cube relative to the first one

  * `x3` : x offset of the third cube
  * `y3` : y offset of the third cube 

  * `x4` : x offset of the fourth cube
  * `y4` : y offset of the fourth cube 

  * `x5` : x offset of the fifth cube
  * `y5` : y offset of the fifth cube 

  * `x6` : x offset of the sixth cube
  * `y6` : y offset of the sixth cube 

  * `x7` : x offset of the seventh cube
  * `y7` : y offset of the seventh cube 

  * `x8` : x offset of the eighth cube
  * `y8` : y offset of the eighth cube
