Part 3


The sliders that I decided to add were eye height, mouth height, face position and colour. I decided these so I could get a better match to some faces that didn't work very well with my sprite.

I used the colour to match the kind of sprite to the colour palette of the portraits. There were mostly autumn ones, since most people had tans, but there were also quite a lot of winters sprites. Sadly there wasn't a lot of pink and green present, so the least prominent one is the spring sprite.'

I've saved the trained values to the train_values files, but for some strange reason they aren't showing up.'
