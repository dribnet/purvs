EXP3 3D form

The first thing that popped out in my mind when I had the idea of creating an isometric alphabet was using 3D shapes. But after a few attempts using the 3d cube from p5 library, I discovered the limitation of using them which is not being able to customize the colour for the faces of my cube and the angle of the cube cannot be exactly the way I want it to be. I am pleased that I have found a way to transform the same idea but using just 2D forms which are drawing my cube out with vertex. In this way I could customize the faces to whatever colour I want and adjust the angle freely.
