## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Changed A, M and W to fit more with the rest of the letters based on feedback.

M looks like McDonalds now especially since it's yellow. I made the first stroke cut off a bit and merge with the other so it would look less like the logo but the colour association is too strong.

I didn't want to change them from the old way I did it because I liked the interpolation but I like these new interpolations as well.

To make the numbers colour system work I added another parameter which checks if the current letter is a number or not with 0 and 1. I don't know if there's a better way to do this, but I thought of this way first and it works :man_shrugging:.

Letters I don't like:
H - Needs a third wave but want to stick with just having 2 lines
I - same with H
M - McDonalds
U,V - very similar

Todo:
The rotation of some letters when interpolating looks janky so maybe I could redraw them with a better rotation number?
N, R, Z
