## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

Final readme - the design I feel does indeed relate to the idea of curvy brush stroke but it feels like it was impacted by the gray transparent shape. So I removed this and it looked much cleaner. Along this, I also changed from green to black since black is the first colour that comes to mind when representing the brush stroke colour. 
Process - at the beginning I was happy with the overall design but I didn't realise that we had to use editor tool to create the letters so when I heard that we had to use editor tool to create the letters, my design idea simply did not look that well which lead me to remove some parametres to suit the new idea..there is a much difference in using the editor tool to create the letters and a difference when not using the editor tool. The letters are not ordinary letters of the alphabet eg. A,B,C but it is in a brush stroke way. I managed to try my best to make the brush stroke letters match the alphabet for easier to read. I really loved the first idea of a blob/jelly which got inspired by the class examples and the green colour I chose, but I was not able to continue with this idea due to the above issues mentioned. Overall, interesting project, but another week of the project would of been best espcially for me since I had to update my idea and make sure all isn't bunched up together. Right now I would say my alphabet letters is Okish..but I would of done better. 


Final 8 parametres:

  let r1x = letterData["r1x"]; //x position
  let r1y = letterData["r1y"];  // y position for stroke
  let r2x = letterData["r2x"]; // x position for shape 2
  let r2y = letterData["r2y"]; // y position for shape 2
  let r3x = letterData["r3x"]; // x position for shape 3
  let r3y = letterData["r3y"]; // y position for shape 3
  let r4x = letterData["r4x"]; // x position for for shape 4
  let r4y = letterData["r4y"]; // y position for shape 4
