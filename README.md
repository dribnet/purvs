## PS2 MDDN 242 2019


Each of my letters is composed with two circles and one rectangle. The size and position of the rect is fixed. I remain the first 2 parameter to make the position of the first circle,  and I add another two parameters to change the position of the 2nd circle.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the two circles
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the 2nd one
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the 2nd one

This is the sketch and my idea of my alphbet.
