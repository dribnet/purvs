## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Episode 05.5 Experiment 

i figured out a way to randomized the positions of the squares to create a unique puzzle like look on the outside layer. I have also improved the ellipses to make it look better in accordance with the changes made. so the squares when generated are moving at random positions of x and y at a set parameter of 5 each.

##INSTANCES THAT I HAD UNDERTOOK
-take photos (REVISED)
-make theme (REVISED)
-test the smartmask(REVISED)
-experiment further with the code... more to go (REVISED)

(i never used the smartmask since a large portion of my images didnt really use any of the specifics the program had so it was quite different the way it ended up).
