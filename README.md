This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

The second face is a version of the Mario & Luigi sketch I made earlier. This version casts luigi aside (don't worry, he's used to it!) and draws our sewer-spelunking hero with some features mapped to four of the sliders:
	- Mousache slant
	- Pupil dilation
	- Moustache bushiness: modulates the size of the individual ellipses that make up the moustache. also modulates the size of mario's nose
	- Cheek chubbiness

I liked the art style that i used for my Mario. I thought that his cheeks made him look like a baby so I decided to make my next face that of a baby. I used 4 sliders for this onel giving control over:
	- nose size
	- cheek chub
	- mouth openness
	- 'alertness' when baby is tired he starts to drool and has trouble keeping his eyes open

In the third face I tried out a darker robot idea. This robot is always staring right at you and might have a wide or narrow head. His middle eye is a lazy eye.
