## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Just playing around with the code Phoebe was using in the videos and seeing what different effects looked like with my masks and photographs. I altered and played around with the third one the most and started to really experiment with texture. It also made me realise I do not really want to use black and white photographs because I think it is quite boring and I want to do something a bit more bright, might just be the photo though. I am still trying to come up with a theme for my assignment and what type of photos I want to take.
