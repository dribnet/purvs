Interaction Development

So I didn't have to visually change any of my fonts to suit the interactions thankfully. However there are a few differences in the parameters. I adjusted them into a more exact form so that the transitions would look better. I didn this by making sure all the letters share a more consistent framework in where each x coordinate is located in comparison to each font. This basically just insures that most of the letter transitions don't have a triangle flip in on itself.

I also decided to run with the linear transition provided in class because I feel that my letterform is complex enough in the transitions without adding anything special because it all ready has a lot on. I considered doing a full rotation for each but I think this would make the font start being to complex in the transitions. Also I have noticed on the transition page that the new letter on the top still hasn't completed the transition however this is an issue with the provided code and not mine because I noticed that in the lecture as well so I don't feel I need to change this.
