## PS1 MDDN 342 2017


Hannah Dockerty PS2, Face Mapping

I've added a filter on the background image so that the color scheme isn't too overwhelming. This enables me to keep a consistent aesthetic throughout each image. It also gives the effect of the person in the image wearing a coloured mask, which I find quite intriguing.  

I've also added in eyebrows using a very similar technique to PS1. I'm disappointed at how much less expressive they are when using data from real people. 

In order to compensate for a lack of expression, I've begun to add in other features, beginning with the nose. I've tried to pay attention to making sure that it looks passable in profile as well as head on. 

The mouth was much easier to form, as it has a lot of points mapped out already, so I didn't have to find any other values in order to map it. 

Next, I need to ad some variation in skin and eye color, then I'll begin training.
