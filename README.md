## Powers of 10 PRINT

In my project, I am wanting to show how colors mix together by each level being the color of multiple colors in the lower level, using [Additive Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color).

This is inspired by classical color newspaper printing, by using dots of primary colors together to generate a different color when seen from far away.
