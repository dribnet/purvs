## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I’ve added grey masks for the rest of the images and have settled on final numbers that best suit all the images. It was a bit difficult to do this as the render time took way too long, but the final outcome was worth it! I really am fond of how these simple codes convey the image very well. I definitely think that adding more complex shapes and more effects would’ve dimmed down the abstractness of the image, as the image itself is already pretty abstract.
