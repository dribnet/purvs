TIDE CLOCK:
This clock shows when high tide/low tide are in Wellington. 
The dark blue rectangle represents the water level, when it is at the top, it is high tide, at the bottom is low tide.
It only shows hours & minutes as numbers, but in order to represent seconds, the full circles of the numbers slowly 'drip down' making them hollow (no fill)
Alarm flashes yellow/red. I tried to make an alarm 'progress bar' but I can't see it working on the debugger.
