### Geometric Clock Progress

I have added an alarm function to my clock where the geometry pulses in and out once the alarm triggers. I have also refined some of my code so that the division between hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds is more clear in terms of both timing and size. I have also worked on the colours of my geometries, they now shift and change in sync with the shapes.
