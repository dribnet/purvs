## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

8/06/2020

I spent this session mostly fixing up problems that I had created from the previous iteration. Mainly the gaps in between areas where the beziers weren't covering anything and the backgound colour came through too strongly. I tried quite a few things to fix this like adding in background rectangles and adding a rectangle that goes just under the bezier that is a little transparent. None of these options really worked though and I ended up just changing the background colour and moving where the beziers are created up 50 and across 20.

For my next step I want to create some contrast to the painterly effect that I have going on by adding some solid blocks of colour I feel like this will give the renders more focus.
