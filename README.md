## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Colours
   
I tested out some more colour this time instead of just white and grey I figured that it would look more interesting if it has a splash more colour. With this I like it better because it isn't just plain, it still is but it is more exciting than before. I think with the fill and opacity I will keep it this way because I like the look of it better. As for the animation I left it as it is because I liked the latest version of the animation tests I made a few commits ago. As for anything I might add I'm not sure I will but I will think about it. Next I will add in the exhibition to the code and see how it turns out. For names I was thinking of Crescent.
