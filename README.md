I was inspired by a Dutch furniture designer and architect, Gerrit Thomas Rietveld, especially his famous design, Red and Blue Chair. So I imitated the colors from his chair design to show my respect. Also, I utilized the transpancy to do this design in order to show that each color can influence each other. Even though red, blue and yellow are very simple color, they still have some new creation for each combination. 

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have made 3 changes for the alphabet, including sizes of the arcs, x and y of the arcs.

The six parameters per letter are now:
  * `size2` : radius of the red arcs
  * `size3` : radius of the yellow arcs
  * `size4` : radius of the blue arcs
  * `x1` : x offset of the red arcs
  * `x2` : x offset of the yellow arcs
  * `x3` : x offset of the blue arcs
  * `y1` : y offset of the red arcs
  * `y2` : y offset of the yellow arcs
  * `y3` : y offset of the blue arcs

Red and Blue Chair is inspired by Piet Cornelies Mondrian's drawing. He is good at combining line, dot, and flat planes into his art. I think Red and Blue Chairis the best translation of 3D design for Piet Cornelies Mondrian's famous drawing. However, my point is not showing a Piet Cornelies Mondrian's drawing in P5.js. I should combine my style into my design. Personally, I think retangle is representing masculine. It could not tell more emotions, like the modern buildings in the city. They all look like kind of same shape with different sizes without telling more emotion.

In this design, I did not utilize rectangles because I don't want to make my design looks cold. I think the color combination of red, blue and yellow is a little bit cold, it is not as soft as some light colors. Therefore, I used half circles as elements for it to make it more acceptable.
