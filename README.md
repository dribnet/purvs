## Stage 1

My goal is to investigate the possibilities of a nested voronoi pattern.
What happens when a voronoi is used to represent zones on a map, and is
subdivided upon levels of higher zoom?
What happens to the borders?

I have now got as far as jittering the points infinitely at one level.
It is interesting that the function is already discontinuous. 
If you drag to the upper right you will notice some sharp edges.

This breaks the "lipschitz condition" of having a continuously 
differentiable function with a bounded derivative.
