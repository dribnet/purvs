Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 6 parameters.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The trangles also use a fill with a slight opacty giving it a layered look.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : x and y value of pointOne
  * `pointTwo` : x and y value of pointTwo
  etc..
=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
