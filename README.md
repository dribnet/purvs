## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

For my sketch I used 3 different shapes (a triangle, square and circle) as the background for my letters, each in a different colour. Then there is a foreground triangle that has been scaled and rotated to create negative space in the letter and some lines on the side. 


I have now completed my first version of the alphabet using only using circles, triangles and squares to start with. At this point the letters are very abstract and some look quite similar to each other. Therefore, for the next version of my alphabet I am going to start using both vertical and horizontal lines to make sure the letters are both readable and distinguishable.


The parameters per letter:
  * `backgroundShapeType` : the type of the background shape (triangle, circle, sqaure)
  * `backgroundShapeRotate` : the rotation of the background shape
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the foreground traingle in relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the foreground triangle in relative to the first one
  * `triangleRotate` : roation of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleSize` : size of the foreground triangle
  * `linesVerticalXpos` : the x postion of the vertical lines
