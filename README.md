## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


progress

I was inspired by the work form processing. The initial idea is if I transfer the whole thing to the Z axis and I may find a specific angle to give a sense of 3d to viewers.
I referenced Isometric projection, An isometric view of an object can be obtained by choosing the viewing direction such that the angles between the projections of the x, y, and z-axes are all the same. It points out the mathematics method how to calculate the rotation angle.

I push my experiment from 2d to 3d, that's the key point of my plan. I have done some research about how to control the camera viewpoint ortho() so that I can show the image by a setting-up angle.



<!-- The start

I spent about two weeks to explore the field of image processing both in p5js and processing. After I gained deeper understanding of it, I was going to think about custom pixels.

The first step is how to locate each pixel in the image. Definitely, there is a way offered in the example file. I also have learned another way to locate the pixel in image.

Then, I roughly create different shapes for the pixels to take a glance of the visual effect.

By the way, I was thinking of the animation effect for this project. I am betting that would be cool. surely, in this case, I have tried sorts of methods to figure it out.
