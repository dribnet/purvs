Part 3: Interpolation
Part 4: Exhibition
5/5

Just refined some more details. Originally for the 'glow' around the letters I was just playing with the opacity. However, because there's an overlap of the lines in many of the shapes there were a lot of little bits of the glow line that were more opaque than others. It looked really inconsistent and just unappealing.

To combat this I colour picked the glow line colour from a screenshot of my alphabet and changed it accordingly - so the glow line colour is now at full opacity. Overall I'm much happier with how this looks.

For the interpolation I used an if statement to then create an in between state for each animation - basically the arc completes a full 360 and both the horizontal and vertical lines pull into the centre and shrink down before everything transitions into the next letter. I player around with faster timing a little bit by changing the percentages (up to 75%), but decided to stick with 50 because it changed to the new letter to quickly at the end that you don't really get to see the animation.

I adjusted a few of the letters and numbers as well, particularly the lines when they occurred insider the arc, e.g. if they aren't key parts to the design and they occur within the arc, the length of the line is no more than 25. I worked on the numbers more as well - now they're a bit more distinctive than the letter as they're bigger (more like capital letters).
