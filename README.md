## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

i tested out the smartmask on the lantern flowers. The mask ended up okay it covered majority however it did not work well covering the bottom bits of the flowers. The mask leaves this gap between the flowers so I think that it is best to just leave it and go with my original one for the lantern flowers. I will test out the other flowers and see how they work. 

I had some trounle with the mask but it was all just simplle issues that I did not pay close enough attention to.
