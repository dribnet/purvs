This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

In my case, in each of my faces I use all 5 sliders. For the these faces I have created monstors using basic shapes and colours.

In my first face, I have created shapes that can be altered to change his emotions. You can change between square eyes or round eyes or have all of them. You can change his mouth shape and rotate him slightly.

The second face can grow facial hair, move his eyes to look at his fellow monstors to each side of himw and blink.

The third can alter the side of his face, as well as have circular or square eyes, and the shape of his mouth/teeth can be altered.

For all of them, I added the ability to become transparent and change colour, as all good monstors should.
