I started to play around with the sliders and replaced the rectangles with arcs to make my letters with.
I made an A, B, and C with the arcs, and added their data to the sketch1 file.
I tried playing around with adding another parameter per arc, I statred using a y-scale (changing the width) of the arcs but it just looked weird so I am sticking with just changing the angle of the all the arcs.
I now have a full alphabet, A-Z, and a default icon. I still need to tweek some of the letter forms and then create the number forms and special characters as well.

My alphabet includes three concentric arcs, the arcs do not change size or position. To form my letters the arcs change 'length,' I have six parameters per letter, these are the angles for each end of each arc. The outer arc is also thicker and the inner arc thinner to add some visual differences

The six parameters per letter are now:
	`Outer Arc`
		*`Arc Start`: angle of one end of the arc
		*`Arc End`: angle of the other end of the arc
	`Middle Arc`
		*`Arc Start`: angle of one end of the arc
		*`Arc End`: angle of the other end of the arc
	`Inner Arc`
		*`Arc Start`: angle of one end of the arc
		*`Arc End`: angle of the other end of the arc
