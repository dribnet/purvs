POSSIBLE ARRANGEMENT

I'm more or less happy with this arrangement for my final hand in. I have tried to create more of a focal point but I have added some faces around the edge to show more of them. I'm not sure if there is a minimum number of faces needed in the final hand in and I can't really tell in the brief so hopefully there isn't.
