## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Got the cross stitch pattern working. I set the background to a cream colour to mimic the type of fabric used with cross stitch projects and have enlarged the stitches so that the picture can be more easily seen.

I have put it in a very solid grid formation but I previously and unintentionally had it with the random x and y values applied which gave it a very painterly feel to it. I may return to that design as I feel that the cross stitch custom pixel does not work well for bigger projects as the crosses which make up the cross stitch design get lost the smaller they stitch gets and just becomes a normal picture.

My next step is to explore this more painterly feel.
