## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process 1:

The first picture is the photo of a person playing piano. For my pixels, I have used triangles for the background of my photo. But this make the background doesn't show clearly compared to the original photo. Besides that, I have filled the piano, the chair, and the person with square shapes. The different between the piano and the person is the square shapes for the piano part are stick together, while the square shapes for the person has gap between each other. Lastly, I am still working on the pixels for other two photos.
