## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I first tried an image i took a while ago of my old scooter & a sunset. I chose this because I thought the sunset would look nice as a 'block' style blackground predominantly one colour, with slight variations in tone. The reason I also chose one with the scooter in the foreground is I'm thinknig my project will be something about transportation - perhaps in an urban setting. More on this to come! 

- I tried giving the background a more linear style, so that the foreground felt more full. I created the background using the noise funcion to make a series of random points that are all connected by a line. The interesting thing about this method is that the outcome varies quite a large amount depending on the noise seed. It also created quite a few interesting patterns at times.
