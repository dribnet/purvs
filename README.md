The wallpaper is generated on an offset grid, the shapes are drawn completely with straight lines.
Clicking causes the colours to change. By using overlapping straight lines it looks like there are curves. The positioning of the grid causes circles to be formed by the shapes.

The scene is genrated using a noise function, the background is generated on a larger grid with smaller squares, the items are placed on a bigger grid whic is also generated by a noise fuction.
