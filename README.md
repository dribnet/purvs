Final Illusion Font 

The biggest challenge for me in this project was to transform 2D shapes
into a 3D looking form. At first I tried designing my alphabet with 3D
cube function from the p5js reference but I realised it limits my design
output a lot as I could not customise the faces of my cube face by face.
Customising colours is a big part of my alphabet since I wanted to show 
an isometric illusion vibe in it. Therefore, I tried drawing 3D looking 
cubes by using the vertex function and layering them to create a 3D look.
It turned out better than I expected and I am happy at how isometric it looks.

I have changed my colour choice for the cube from the colourful hot pink,
yellow and blue to light pink, blue and white. This is because my first 
colour choice looked way too busy in the exhibition. Although my alphabet 
colours for the final are much simpler, it is much pleasant to look at 
while still being aesthetic and isometric. 

I shaved off two parametres by combining two of the cubes that are always
called together into a second object function. In this way I will only need
14 parametres instead of 16 for all my 8 cubes.

  The parameters per letter:

  * `x1` : x offset of the first cube 
  * `y1` : y offset of the first cube 

  * `x2` : x offset of the second cube 
  * `y2` : y offset of the second cube 

  * `x4` : x offset of the fourth cube
  * `y4` : y offset of the fourth cube 

  * `x5` : x offset of the fifth cube
  * `y5` : y offset of the fifth cube 

  * `x6` : x offset of the third and sixth cube
  * `y6` : y offset of the third and sixth cube 

  * `x7` : x offset of the seventh cube
  * `y7` : y offset of the seventh cube 

  * `x8` : x offset of the eighth cube
  * `y8` : y offset of the eighth cube
