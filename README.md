Started working on my landscape. For my inspiration I searched up isometric island, and based my design off what I saw, as I was wanting to do a floating island and thought isometric tile based would be the best option. 

I have a function that draws a tile, and by creating more functions I will be able to add a lot of variety into my landscape. I also added a random variable to affect the height of each tile , to give the landscape more of a realistic look.

Tidied up the different heights, so the ground is always at the same spot, to give a cleaner look to the landscape. Started working on adding more to the landscape, by adding water. Also added sliders to control the size and variety of the landscape.

Added in the perlin noise code from toms example and changed it to work with my code. Writing out the grid was hard to get it to align with my isometric layout, but got it working in the end. Made it so the height is based off the noise value, and lerped the mountain color.

Added trees to the mix, just to add some more to the landscape, as it was a bit bare before. I like the look of the landscape now, and don't think I'll add more items to it. I also added some more variety to the grass by lerping its color, similar to the water and mountains.
