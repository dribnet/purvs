## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I finally added the grey mask to have that sort of outline effect for depth of the jellyfish. For this I used lines, going the opposite direction of the lines for the black mask. I also decided to use the lightest shade possible of grey, so that there would also be some white mask elements added, where there would be circles too.

I’ve thought about adding grids and specific shapes, but I decided not to as the photo itself already conveys so much. I feel like adding more complex shapes would have overflow of the image, which isn’t my goal for this project. I want to show jellyfish in an artistic sense, and I want the image to look expressive both up close and from afar. I might play around a bit with the colours to express more purple.
