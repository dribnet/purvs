## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The 3 images I have used are:
1 - A photo I have taken of my little brother at lorenzen bay, Raglan.
2 - Sunset at Ngarunui beach, Raglan.
3 - Power lines in central park, Brooklyn.

For my images I will focus on using patterns/shapes created in the masking process to add an interesting element to picture.

For example image no.2
- Haven't completed it yet but that is the direction I will be heading in.
