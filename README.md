### Chemical liquid clock

The DiLou (water clock), which took one second for three drops, was a great convenience for people's lives at the time. However, this timing method is less accurate. Inspired by this timing method of ancient time instruments, I had the idea of a "chemical liquid clock". This clock comprises two main beakers. The left beaker represents the number of hours and the right beaker represents the minutes. The 'AM' or 'PM' will be displayed in an small area in the lower right corner. Every minute, a drop will drip over the beaker on the right side, at the same time the liquid in the beaker will increase by one layer. When the time changes from 'AM' to 'PM', the liquid in the beaker changes color.
