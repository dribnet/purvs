## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

FINAL: The beauty around us

This is my final 3 images. I have gone with the theme of nature and used images of flowers from my mums garden to represent this. Especially growing up in this generation; where we are so consumed and bombarded with media and technology we, tend to ignore the beauty around us! We don’t appreciate nature and don’t know how to look after it.

I chose these 3 images as i found the colours of all 3 to be very vibrant and beautiful to look at. My treatment in a way reminds me of cross stitch patterns which i think are really nice. The blurred, pixelated, square background reminds me of technology. The central flowers are emphasised by the white that surrounds the edges, this highlights the beauty that we are missing when we are surrounded by all this technology! 

I made my own masks for my images as when i tested the smart mask it didn't really work for my subject matter as there are only two elements. If i had more elements i would have utilised the smart mask.

I found this project cool as i really like photography so to combine that with coding and see how that turns out was interesting.
If i were to do this again i would look more at different ways i could communicate my theme. I enjoyed this class and have learnt more elements to coding.
