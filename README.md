Lego Faces

//Summary

I am very happy with the final result for this project, with my lego faces having a wide range of randomised variation, whilst having a consisntent design and aesthetic. With each face having a unique emotion, due to this variation. The faces can have a range of eye designs and mouth designs, as well as extra details such as glasses and freckles. This combined allows for a wide but still realistsic range of outcomes, with the more generic face appearing more like you would see in a bell curve distribution. I would have wanted to put more work into features such as the mouth as I did admitedly spend a long time on the faceâ€™s eyes over university break.

//Variation

The faces have a large list of variables behind them, with roughly two thirds being continous variables and the others being discreet, such as the type of eyes or if the face has freckles. Most of the continous variables are used in the eyes, allowing for expressive outcomes with each new batch of faces.

//Arrangement

The arrangement is also inspired by the design of lego instruction books, with the blue background and yellow trim, pulling together the final design and also, I just really liked the look of it. Also, the faces also rotate on random intervals, with each face having a unique and constanly undating timer. Once rotated so it is not facing the viewer a new face is generated giving it the appearacne of being repainted as it spins.
