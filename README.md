## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my final design. My main design and theme was landscape, i wanted the focus to be on the different colours of the sky. In three of my images, it shows 3 different sky colours. I wanted to make sure this was clear in my final dsign. I picked this design mostly because of the background. I think that this background in my final design was the strongest design i had. The squares are random, overlapping each other and there is no fill, so you are able to see the white background popping through. Even though there is no fill to the squares, you are still able to get a good idea of the sky colours. I kept the circles in a uniform order and also filled it in with colour. I did this so there was contrast between the background and the foreground. 
I used my own mask as the smart mask wasn't as accurate as i wanted it to be and didn't pick up all the 'objects' i wanted to mask. I'm happy with the final design and i believe that it is the strongest design i have.
