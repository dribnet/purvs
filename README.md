## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme:
My overall theme for these images is space and astrophotography. I chose this because outside of Uni and Work, my hobby is to take images of space such as Nebulae and Galaxies. I think it would be cool to use my images because these objects in space all have wildly different shapes, sizes and most importantly colors.

Changelog:
Making further adaptations. I have changed the background color to black and made the outer rectangles a lot wider but shorter. I think this makes for a cool effect on the background stars (In the real picture), it makes them have a kinda watery effect, as if they are being reflected in water and they are displaced. The effect on the stars could also be interpreted as movement, like the stars are moving while the nebula/galaxy is not. A problem I was having with the white background is that if there is even the slightest gap between the background and my mask, it would show up white and look really out of place. The black allow me to hide gaps if there is any, due to space being black. The gaps were appearing when I was changing the sizes of my background rectangles to make the wider and shorter, the black background was a must have to avoid this problem.
