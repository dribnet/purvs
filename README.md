### Tree Of Growth Main

This stage here, while looking quite barren, so surprisingly complete. Ive worked out the framework for the clock and from here its just the easy job of implementing imagine in place of the placeholder ellipses, and adding a background and alarm. 

Due to the simplistic nature of the clock, making sure the polish is high is paramount to creating a quality product. 

by the start of next lesson (20th march), I should have my assets completed and added my alarm functions.
