## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Colours
   
This test I tried the opposite of the previous commit.  I made the white black and the black white. I think I like this better as it stand out more and looks more interesting. I think that making the inner arc thinner would look interesting however I don't think it will look that great. As for the outer arc I like it as it however maybe making it thicker would look nice as well giving it a more distinct contrast. As for the colours I might l leave it as it is or making it an off white colour.
