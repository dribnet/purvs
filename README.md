## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2
For my alphabet I have gone for a very rugged sharp look and played around a lot with the different shapes, if you look through my past examples you can see I originally had them more refined and clean before I realised that it made the font look too proper and lost its rugged sharp feel that I was initially going for.

 In terms of the interpolation I spent a long time going over different ways to do it and was really struggling with how to make it consistently smooth considering there were 18 different parameters to play with. I would get one letter right and then the next would be messed up and this effect would butterfly throughout everything. I havent yet decided how I am going to solve this issue.
