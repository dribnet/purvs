## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I have played around with my grid sizes for the two layers of clouds to make sure that there is no clouds that get cut off.

I have also added movement to the legs and arms. The arms swing criss cross and the legs swing back and forth slowly in time with the movement of the parachuter. This is more noticeable when you are zoomed in but it is happening as soon as the parachuters are visable.

I have added tour points that shows moving through the clouds and then up to the details of the parachuter.
