## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I wanted to play around with the colour, stroke and transparency. For this design I changed the colours, made them white and a cream colour and I returned the stroke to the original size (4). The similar colours do make it difficult to see the different elements and the transparency. I think I will keep the colours very different.

The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
