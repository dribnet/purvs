## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I am now looking at different ways to display my image and paying around with the different features. I dont think I will try this one again as I dont think it works well with this image. I might look into other images and see if I can see a theme to use for this project. 

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
