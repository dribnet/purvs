## PS1B MDDN 342 2017 Title

For Spongebob I was experimenting with the shape of his body/face and his eyes. I used discrete values here to alter the for loop i used to draw his curves

For Morty I was experimenting with curves for his nose and mouth. His hair is also changeable.

For Batman I created his face using vertices and gave them parameters so his actual face structure can be changed.
