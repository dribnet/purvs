With my letter forms I decided to go with my second idea of the the two arcs. I've create all the letters and numbers for them as so far I am happy with it. Making it took a while as I couldn;t figure out how to rotate the arcs but once I figured it out it wasn't too difficult to make the rest. The thing that took the longest was finding hte position of hte arcs when I rotated them. 

I think that now i have drawn out all the forms I will play with colour and stroke sizes too see what looks interesting. I might add something more to the forms as they look a bit plain. So maybe a circle or a line would be interesting to see. I think that maybe if the outer arc as filled in and the inner was not it would look pretty interesting. Or have then both filled in with different colours but the stroke would be none. I think for now i will play around with it and see what I come up with. 

I ended up having to add some more variables to the list as I realized that i needed two rotate variables. One for the outer and one for the inner. As for sixe I turned it into a variable as well to make it easier if I wanted to change the size or something. So far I have a total of 7 variables. 

pos2x this draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y this draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x this draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 this rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 this rotates the inner arc
