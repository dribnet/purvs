Part 2 - My alphabets design

This is my draft drawing of my alphabets. My initial idea was inspired by morse code. Thus, I want to design my alphabets using morse code with circle and rectangle. I actually searched for the actual morse code and try to design and rearrange them. I realised that it is hard to present out some of the letters by just using the shape of circle and rectangle, so I decide to use triangle and combine them together.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `c1x` : x axis of the circle
  * `c1y` : y axis of the circle
  * `r1x` : x axis of the rectangle
  * `r1y` : y axis of the rectangle
  * `t1x` : x axis of the triangle
  * `t1y` : y axis of the triangle
