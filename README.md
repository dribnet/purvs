With updated thumbnaiil/preview:

Today I was just working on futher developing my original sketch idea, and sussing out how many parameters I want for each letter. I find I keep getting quite confused when it comes to parameters and how many I have/whether or not each letter has the same number.

Updated parameters:

Parameters:
  * `sizex` : size of x axis
  * `sizey` : size of y axis
  * 'offsetx' : x offset of first rect that will 'cut hole' in relation to large stationary one
  * 'offsety' : y offset of first rect that will 'cut hole' in relation to large stationary one
  * `size3x` : size of x axis for third square
  * `size3y` : size of y axis for third square
