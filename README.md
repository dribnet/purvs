Use space to generate a new landscape, or left click to regenerate the same landscape but update it for the slider values. Use the selector option to change between Wallpaper and LandScape modes. The landscape will update slider changes instantly for smaller landscapes, but won't for bigger ones.

For my wallpaper I wanted to do a simple modern design, so I choose only two colors and created a really simple and clean pattern with arcs, that reminded me of a vinyl record. I chose the light grey background as it looks like paper, and gives the design almost a hand drawn look, which I really liked.

For my landscape I wanted to create an isometric floating island, thats tile based. I wanted to play around with perlin noise to create the various heights of a terrian. In the end I ditched the floating aspect, as originally I was planning to have clouds, and waterfalls running off the island. I instead created a chunk of a landscape and displayed the same as I would have for a floating island. 

I created 4 sliders to go with the landscape, to really help add more variety to each landscape. I used a seed so changing the sliders will let you see the same landscape change to the new values. I also animated these changes (although it only animates for smaller landscape due to lag) so you can see the changes smoothly, and I think it looks really nice.
