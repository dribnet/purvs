## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've made some parameters, and have started playing around with their values to see what I can do to make each letter unique. I've done the first line of my alphabet, I'm fairly happy with most of them however I do think B and C are a little too similar. I already have 12 parameters and am struggling to think of ways to make the rest of my letters stand out from their letter siblings. I may take out offsetx and offsety since I don't plan on moving the entire letter itself around, but I will keep this as a last resort.

I'm umming and aaing about possibly adding a little something extra to my letter to give myself more options, I still really like my inital idea, I just think I might have sold myself a little short having the rays as the only changing part.
