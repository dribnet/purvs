## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

## March 31th

I changed some of the letters.  I did not have a plan for the letter "C" unfortunately.
So, I made the "A" like a house.  For the "b" I was originally going to have a normal circle and a stem.
I then changed it to have the light pink circle inside the "b" because that's where the light pink circle ended up inside c on accident.
I don't know what the plan is going forward.  Hopefully I will have something after tomorrow.
