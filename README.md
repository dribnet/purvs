## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

I played around with the colours and rotation. I ended up with this which reminds me of a abstract pool mirror image of some sort. I like the colours and how it looks but i don't think that this would work very well for any of the images so I think I will keep experiementing and see what I come up with. I do like the blue background gradient.
