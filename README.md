CONTINUING WITH MY ALPHABET

Today I changed what I currently had in the last commit to square proportions rather than a rectangle. Then I continued along with my alphabet and go up to letter W. So far I'm ding really well and am happy with how the letterforms are turning out. now that I have changed to square proportions I have noticed that in a lot of my letters I keep the width of the rectangle the same (50). So I could potentially take this out as a parameter since I'm not really changing it much. then I would just have to work around changing the letters that use less than 50. This also applies for the arc width and height I seem to keep them the same throughout the letters so I might also look into taking this out and changing my parameter to "size" that way I can still play around with the size of the arcs. This means I could potentially remove two parameters, then later down the line i can choose to add more parameters if need be for something else. 

The fourteen parameters per letter:
  * `rectX` : x location of the rectangle
  * `rectY` : y location of the rectangle
  * `rectW` : width of the rectangle
  * `rectH` : height of the rectangle
  * `arcW` : width of the arc
  * `arcH` : height of the arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the first arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the first arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the first arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the first arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the second arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the second arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the second arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the second arc


Sketch Links: 
Last time I tried to commit the links of my sketches came up as broken. I have tried again and hope that they show up.
These also relate to my sketch designs from my first sketch.js i did, I did these before I started coding.

If that doesnt work then heres them typed out.
