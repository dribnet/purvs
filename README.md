## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Episode 02 THEME

Three objects that represent the mundane lifestyle of a design student. this is shown by the water bottle next to a familiar desk and the rubiks keychain in his bag along with a harddrive plugged in to the computer with a mouse. all to show the everday items that most students will have while they study. but this mostly just my perspective.
