## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

During this project I struggled at the start as my project 3 didn’t translate over at all. It was a bit demoralizing but I was happy with what I ended up with. I felt like starting with animation was the best course of action for me as it helped me iterate and explore what I could create on the grid code. I began with playing around with sin wave motion, I knew that I wanted some form of smooth animation to interest the viewer. From here I moved onto paying with the zoom levels which was me just introducing different shapes and forms on each level. 

While playing with this code I found a cool little effect that I could create using maps and the HSB color range. I mapped the x and y of the grid to create this effect that introduced more colors as the grid got smaller, I felt like this really stepped my project up a notch and made it somewhat interesting. I think that technically I could have played around with the code more but with time closing in on me I decided to keep it simple and make something that looked good visually, I was also happy with how smooth it runs. I’m happy with the output of this project but I think I could have maybe explored some other avenues in terms of detail/technical side of things.

The tour I added explores the range of coloured graphics that my project creates, and then zooms all the way in to see the nice gradients that a formed by the dense grid.
