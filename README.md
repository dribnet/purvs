## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I've just finished all of the characters, and now I'm moving onto the animation stuff. I'm still thinking about the colour scheme/overall theme of the alphabet. I kind of want to keep the childish look and feel of the current iteration, but I also want to change it completely and go in the opposite direction, and make it more serious.

I think I might try to emulate how normal writing looks on paper when using those really thick caligraphy brushes. I would use an off white/light brown colour for a piece of card, and then I would use a dark colour or black for the ink.
