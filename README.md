EXP2 Parametres Shaving

I have shaved two extra parametres off from 16 to 14 by combining two cubes that are always called together into a second object function(drawPart2). In this way, two cubes share 1 set of x,y coordinate(pos6x, pos6y) together rather than having their own set. I am happy with the result as surprisingly this change did not affect how my alphabet looks since I was worrying that it might mess up the layering of all my cubes.
