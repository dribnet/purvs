| 03/06/2020 | I had an idea to use my photos that are based off Vincent van Gogh paintings, especially if I'm able to create a painter-ly effect with my custom pixel. Spent today formatting the photos and creating the 3-tone masks for them each as each image has a fore/middle/background. Have yet to touch the code but will be doing that over the next few days.						  |
| 27/05/2020 | First tests with Project 3. I knew that I just wanted to try working with a screenshot I took in Elite: Dangerous a few weeks ago of a sun. I also figured, I could just desaturate and slightly modify the levels to make it an appropriate mask, and the end result turns out pretty okay. At this time I haven't looked into anything else too much.								   |

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
