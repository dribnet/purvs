This readme explains my assignment 3 sketch.
I am currently working on the fairytale sketch I am creating for my landscape. 
It will have various interchangable landscape features. At the moment I have created a version of the sky and one of the hills that will be repeated many times to form a mountain range.
The colours are not currently accurate, they are just stand ins, chosen to demonstrate lerping clearly, they will be swapped out later
