Experiment 2 + 3

 I decided to add some more colour to some of my shapes to help distinguish them more from each other. So I added another if statement and made it so that if it equaled two rather than one the shape would become a turquoise colour. This did make my letters different but did not help to define the shape of the letter form better. Therefore, I decided to really go with the abstract thinking that my code looked like some sort of puzzle therefore it would be great if it were sort of a like a puzzle to work out what the letters were. I also have kept the colours the same throughout because I think it fits well with my idea of my letterforms being a code and they are also blocky and remind me of matrix code.

 I wanted to see what my letter forms looked like without the grid just in case they looked better this way. I kept my parameters the same and simply commented out my grid shape.  This gave an interesting effect and looked similar to piled up jenga blocks or some sort of puzzle in which you slide blocks of wood together. However, I felt as though I had lost something and the overall aesthetic was not how I intended it to be and I did not like it. So I decided to go for my experiment two for my final design.
