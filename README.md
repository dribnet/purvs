## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme:
My overall theme for these images is space and astrophotography. I chose this because outside of Uni and Work, my hobby is to take images of space such as Nebulae and Galaxies. I think it would be cool to use my images because these objects in space all have wildly different shapes, sizes and most importantly colors.

Changelog:
I am now experimenting with the code, trying to make some cool effects by using different shapes and sizes for the render program. One of the shapes I chose to use was a star shape for anything outside of the mask, the shape fits with the overall theme aswell as making a cool effect in the output images. The real stars that are in my original images are rendered out to look like a plus/cartoony looking star shape the makes for a cool effect. I still want to further play around with whats in my mask and how that is rendered out, right now it is still Ellipses but the sizing has been changed.
