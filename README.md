## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Pressed



Touch-ups:
I decided to clean up my masks and also added an outline for all foreground objects. This makes them stand out from the background even more. The background has a tranparent layer over-top of it that chooses a random color between black and white and creates this "TV-static" effect. This obscures the background and dilutes it's colour, making it seem non-important and exendable whilst leaving the forground image(s) with all the importance.

Development:
When playing around with grids, I found that putting a small diamond off-centered on top of a rectangle, it makes all the pixels look like buttons. In the masked area, there is no diamonds and there are rectangles with a stroke of a specific colour, this makes the "buttons" look pressed in. This takes my initial foreground-focussed theme and makes the foreground component look like it's made out of activated/pressed buttons.

Part 2: Theme:
The group of photos I've used don't have much in common inherently but I decided to try using the mask to really push the objects within them to the foreground (contrast between small, scarce pixels and big, densely packed pixels). I did this subtly for the building image, less sublty for the fire hydrant image, and extremely obviously for the dog photo. I think from here I need to fool around with the sketch.js and the masks to find out what works best for contrasting objects from their background.

Part 1: Photographic Sketches:
I started off with the image of the praying mantis but I found it wasn't very interesting because of the lack of colour (pretty much all black and green). I decided to use an image of this building and adjusted the algorithm to put it in the forefront.
