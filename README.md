Official Sketch One

I have finished tweaking my initial sketch and have added all the parameters I think I will need (hopefully anyway! May need to add to more for more complex shapes...). In this sketch I have used a series of squares that are all the same proportions to each other, and have used smaller squares to block out aspects of the larger square for each letter in order to form the letters. Depending on the position/amount of smaller squares and what they obscure determines which letter is shown.

Parameters:

  * `sizex` : size of x axis of smaller boxes
  * `sizey` : size of y axis of smaller boxes
  * 'offsetx' : x offset determines x position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * 'offsety' : y offset determines y position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * `boxX` : x position of second small square, relative to big square
  * `boxY` : y position of second small square, relative to big square
