Matchstick Alphabet

Rain Ba

When I first learned this project, I wanted to make some different shapes of boxes to represent letters, but I thought it was too abstract.

I always hope that the final effect will be interesting and will not be confusing. When I was a child, my friends with me would be taken a
matchstick to make all kinds of plane figures or three-dimensional figures, which was the source of my idea, so I choose the matchstick element. 
I used the color of the matchstick itself to express the theme more visually.

Before started coding, I made some sketches on the paper because the number of strokes of each letter was different. So I finally chose the quantity of four matches, 
because it could satisfy the most complex letters. The initial sketches went quite well until they were edited and there were some problems such as misaligned angles, 
insufficient length, and misaligned positions. In the later stage, I tried to adjust the position as much as possible to fit the feeling or change the original idea to make new letters.


As far as animation is concerned, I think these matchsticks are endowed with life, and they transform into another letter in the continuous jump. 
It was written at the very beginning that when I was a child, I often used matches to make patterns, so the last words I spelled included "fireworks", "children" and "hometown". 
Here can also express a childlike mood.


  
The twelve parameters per letter:

  let posX1 = letterData["X1"];
  let posY1 = letterData["Y1"];
  let posX2 = letterData["X2"];
  let posY2 = letterData["Y2"];
  let posX3 = letterData["X3"];
  let posY3 = letterData["Y3"];
  let posX4 = letterData["X4"];
  let posY4 = letterData["Y4"];
    
  let rotR1 = letterData["R1"];
  let rotR2 = letterData["R2"];
  let rotR3 = letterData["R3"];
  let rotR4 = letterData["R4"];
