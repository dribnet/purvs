This is the final part - exhibition. I named my font "Straight" as my design only uses straight lines to create the alphabet. The other words i picked was "Pleasing" and "Simpleee" as those are what describes my design. I really like watching animation of the letters change. There was an issue where the letters were overlapping each other, so i had to go back and adjust the alphabet code so they fitted between the rectangles. Once i did that, it all worked fine and the letters weren't over lapping!
