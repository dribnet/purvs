## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

**May 16 2020**

I did a sketch with an idea of what I want to go for my letters. 

I drew my inspiration from mathematic symbols, mainly derived from the division symbol.

My basic shapes will be lines and ellipses. I found it a bit difficult to work under 12 variables but that is what I love about this challenge!

Here is my sketch: https://prnt.sc/shrcc5

However, the letters may change over time.

 I finally opened up the intimidating draw_letters.js and letter.js, and I found it quite difficult trying to get things to show up on alphabet and encountered a few errors! 

 After a few tries I managed to get stuff to show up. 

 I did A and B which were quite easy since I completed it in the sketch, however C was very difficult.

 I managed to get an idea done for C and from experimenting I managed to get a few parameters for other letters that I had planned to do. 

I will be doing things such as the colours later, but I just wanted something done in my code for the weekend.

I worked on a few letters and managed to get the editor working! This helped me out a lot and made things a lot easier, so i'm grateful we were able to take advantage of this for this project. 

Due to some limitations with my parameters, I don't think I am 100% able to go with the designs initially planned from my sketch. However, I will work around this and try to find more of a consistent pattern.

I plan to finish all my letters today. I don't have an idea on what my numbers will look like yet, but I'm sure i'll come up with it soon.

I have some sort of an idea on what to call my alphabet, I'm thinking of something to do with mathematic symbols maybe. 

I updated the colour scheme! Initially I tried to go for three colours of pink, orange and blue, but I found that these colours didn't suit well together. After playing around I found that pink would be a suitable colour for all elements, since I wanted the colour of the circles to be pink. 

I'm thinking of doing a stroke on top of a stroke to create more colour elements to my letters, but for now I will just focus on my letters to get it done!

I decided to add another parameter, however this must be the last one as this is my 12th and I do not want to make any more, not only for the brief but also to limit myself for more of a challenge. This parameter is the size of my second circle.

Therefore, my FINAL parameters are:

**sizeLine1** = 	determines the size of BOTH lines, this 					is used to create a symmetric effect.
**sizeCirc1** = 	determines size of circle 1
**sizeCirc2** = 	determines size of circle 2
**circ2x** = 		X position of circle 1
**circ2y** = 		Y position of circle 1
**circ3x** = 		X position of circle 2
**circ3y** = 		Y position of circle 2
**linePosX1** = 	X position of line 1
**linePosY1** = 	Y position of line 1
**linePosX2** = 	X position of line 2
**linePosY2** = 	Y position of line 2
**linePosY3** = 	Y position of side 1 of line 1

After this I was able to create a letter with two different types of circle sizes, which is "R" in this case. 

I have also changed the following letters: C, D, J, I, G, as well as creating E, F and R.

I started to give myself a break with the letters and moved on to numbers! I created number 1-7 and decided to follow a method that was quite different to how I approached the letters. I would have my main lines as two side by side, and I'd have my circles joined with the two lines. This is how I want viewers to be able to tell the variation in numbers and letters. 

Approaching number 8, I'm thinking of just taking what I've done for B and changing the letter B into something different. 

I have also decided on my final colours! I went with a pink theme and used different shades of the colour for a simplistic style as my alphabet is quite modern.
