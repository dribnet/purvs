### Tree of Growth Clock

This clock has three rows for second, minute and hour. A tree grows each second til there are sixty, where a tree in the minute row will grow. After there are sixty in the minute row, a tree in the hour row will grow. 
After a row is full, it falls down to start again. 

Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
