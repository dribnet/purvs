Part 2: Zoom function
With my current sketch I implemented in a zoom function, since mine isnt a 2D sketch, I had to make it so that it would move in a similar way as a 2D version. So at the moment the controls are:

-Arrow_up: move up
-Arrow_down: move down
-Arrow_left: move left
-Arrow_right: move right
- "+" Key : zoom in
- "-" Key : zoom out

Later on ill try to make them on screen controls, rather than keyboard based ones, and also and in landmark buttons to goto the various stages of the animation.
