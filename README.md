## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README

Update this file as you go along to record your progress.

I will be making a clock represented by three city building silhouettes, and a large moon behind these. All the buildings will have lights turned on/off, and the amount of lights turned on will be the time for each of the buildings. The 3 buildings represent the month, hour, and minute of the day, the stars will be pulsing according to each second, like a visual metronome. The big moon behind the three city buildings will change according to the months moon phases.

There could be a rotation of sun and clouds and moon and stars, to make the scene not as static. 
Instead of the month, I could do the date of the month.
