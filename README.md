Today I started exploring a different path. I recently learned about Greebles and their use in creating Sci-Fi textures for cities and vehicles. I really like the look of these and wanted to explore how these could be made procedurally with code. My thought is that I can randomly create layers of rectangles that stack on top of each other to get this effect. I experimented with this and like what I have started but see a lot that needs improving. The main thing is finding a way for the layer being drawn to only be placed above rectangles of the previous one. This will give it a better look of stcking and stop the unwanted overflow over edges.
