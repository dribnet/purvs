## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In this commit I have added the third layer to the masks and coded that into the sketch file. There is a little bit to do for this project, but I think that the only pixel type that needs improving is the person one because I think the nature pixel and the background pixel work really well to display nature and the background, but the person one needs itterating. 

I am happy with the pictures I have used aswell, just might need to talk to a tutor about the pixels and see what I can do to improve them.
