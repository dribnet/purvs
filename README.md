-Final Sketch

Using my own images I wanted to look at portraying global warming and how this is destroying the planet. I used my brothers to symbolise the younger and older generation. In this sketch I played around with how I might use my flower glyph to represent this but think I don't quite do it justice. I want to make it clearer that the harsh square parts of the photograph represent global warming. The soft flower glyphs represent nature. I don't think that is clear here because it looks more like the flowers are taking over the boys rather than the flowers I may swap this. Also It is hard to distinguish the flower change therefore I would like to add a circular pattern mask that surrounds the flower mask so it will soften the change between these. Also I would like to change the squares to the splotches which are shown in the first art work and third on the taller boy.
