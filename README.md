## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Photographic Sketch Update - Part 1.

Using this image. I played around with the code and added some transparent clour for the background. The image is originally black and white but you can still see the actual focal point as I have highlighted the baackground. Also made a mask for the image.
