PART 3

This version shows the completed levels of zoom over 10 layers. Some of the colours are still in debugging mode which is something I will change in the coming versions. I've chosen a very similar methid for generation of each layer, however I think they vary enough graphically to be considered seperate. I also added the max zoom level and tour function in but am yet to focus it toward my code.
