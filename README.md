## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Due to spilling coffee all over my keyboard during Monday's lecture, I had a fair bit of catching up to do on a few classes. I am in the process of generating ideas for my alaphabet. I changed around colours and stroke weight as a test commit, using Github Desktop.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
