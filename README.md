## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So I have been thinking of what I can do for a while now, and I don't really have a big message to say. Currently my idea for the whole project is "the importance of play". It more so just relates to me as someone who has grown up with video games my whole life, and how important they have been for be. It also plays into the idea of how important it is to take a step back from the everyday streeses of life and take time to enojoy what you love and relax.

For the image I want to represent this idea by using my desk. My desk is the main part of my room. Its where I have my main setup where I spend the majority of my time working on uni, researching gmaes, and playing games, and catching up with friends, almost everyday. I plan on having many video game references in the image, with figures and stuff, as well as have on the monitor something like "Welcome Back" with other images and stuff surrounding it.

For the algorithm itself I am thinking of using a primairly squares and triangles to build the images. Squares to represent old school pixel art, and the triangles to represent modern day 3d graphics. For the colours I am thinking about using the colours of the SNES, those being grey, green, blue, yellow, and red. This is because there is a wide variety of colours to build the images from, as well as the SNES being an iconic machine with a really recognisable colour pallet.

All of this is still subject to change, but I think that this is a good direction.

I have just been messing with the algorithm and trying to get it looking nice
