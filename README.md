Episode 02

I have added more letters into my alphabet, adding a variation with an ellipse within the code. The next step is to find a way to tilt the third variation of the cipher code to complete the remaining letters within the parametric alphabet.

currently the shown example is represented with the incomplete S, being rotated as an example.

A, B , C , D , E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R

i will upload a full cipher guideline code for a reference.

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
