## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Project updates for Karen O'Brien

I think I've nearly finished with my photo series, I'm very happy with how my masks are looking and I think that my message is conveyed very clearly. I potentially might make a few minor tweaks before hand in, but otherwise I'm feeling relatively finished. As for my favourite image of this series and what I think is the strongest, I really like the bottom (output_3) image as I think both the composition and colouring are really strong. The second image I also quite like due to the large amount of people in it too, which creates a good contrast. While I feel that the colouring of the main subject in the first image came out well, I think that due to the lack of people in the image it creates a less strong message than the other two images.

As New Zealand recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, I want to use this project to remind Wellington of how quickly diseases can spread and the importance of social distancing. As the 'hidden monster among us', dangerous disease is very easily spread through lack of distancing and hygiene, as the world has very quickly learned over the past few months. In my image series I will be using the technique of thermal imaging to show the hidden symptoms of disease amongst society and it's contrast with the rest of the un-contaminated public. By using the warmest colours of bright red, orange and yellow to represent a person infected with Covid-19, this will contrast with the blue/green shades of the background and the slightly warmer shades of green and yellow for the general public. Any surface touched by the person infected will also be warmer and have orange/ yellow colours.

For my code for this project, it consists of multiple else/ else if statements which checks whether a pixel is between a certain grey scale colour range on the mask and then draws a thermal image colour. The way I have been able to manipulate this effect from my original images is through altering my masks. First I would take a copy of the original image, then change it to grey scale and cut out all the areas that I wanted to change the brightness of. Now that I could easily change brightness on different layers, I made the background significantly darker so that it mostly only consisted of blue tones, the main subject significantly brighter so they were yellow, orange and red, and finally the background people, who were in the middle with a yellow and green colour range.
