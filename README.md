GRAND GAIA RUNE FOUNDARY

So some minor adjustments have been made. The holes in letters such as P, Q and R have been removed and styled similar to the starting A and B. Other things include removing anything shapes that were somewhat TOO squarish and adjusted them to be more angular such as lowering the frontal angle of the R down a bit and lifting the bottom U corners up a bit. Otherwise, everything else remains the same...Oh yeah and I also did the interpolation stuff.
