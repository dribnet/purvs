This README explains the distributions experiment with the cartoon faces
I decided to do an experiment with the distributions within the cartoon face sketches, in case I decided to use them in my final along with the rag dolls

These faces make me think of family portraits, so I decided that some features would be very common.
I made most of the faces oval or curcular. 
Angular noses are more common
round eyes are more common
