### Clock Working, No Alarm

The Code is pretty full but I couldn't think of a way around the multiple 
conditional statements I have. But is working perfectly and the numbers are 
all lined up properly. Not that anyone would know the difference tbh. I can 
almost read the clock now, enough at least to know the all the numbers are 
working correctly. 

Now all I need to do is make an alarm which I will need to adjust my code 
probably pretty significantly to get it working however. So hopefully going 
to be doing that today to get a final copy.
