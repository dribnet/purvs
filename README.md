## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

  4/05/2020 First sketch 
Each of my letters will be composed with one circle and one arc. The size and x position of the first circle is fixed, but the positon and size of the arc changes with each letter and is controlled by the parameters. I have started with very simpistic forms but I quite like how the curves give the letters a soft and playful design.

The seven parameters per letter:
  * `ellipseY` : y position of the main circle
  * `width` : size of the arc
  * `height` : size of the arc
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the arc in relation to the circle 
  * `offsety` : y offset of the arc in relation to the circle
  * `angleStart` : angle to start the arc
  * `angleStop` : angle to finish the arc

6/05/2020 Alphabet beginning 
	I have started putting my letters into draw_letters.js and letters_js and gettign the right proportions to fit the guiding box. I have draw out the alphabet on paper using the circle and arc and have ideas for each letter. I have added a stroke to the circle as I found my design was looking too simplistic but I may develop the design more when I move further into the project. I have also added another parameter to change the y positon of the circle as I discovered that the cicle needed to be higher up to form letters such as p, g, j, q, and y.
