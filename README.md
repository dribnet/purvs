For this project, I have been thinking about the general landscape ideas. I have also been thinking about general wallpaper and what I would like to be there and what kind of purpose/location it would use. Kinda vague buthopefully you follow.

Home for me is on a quite a big hill, looking out to sea when not in Wellington so I wanted to create a side view land to sea kind of landscape piece. This idea led me to bring in some inspiration and was thinking of Mykonos.

Mykonos is a Greek port town on the edge of an isalnd in the Mediterranean which is known for it's white building architecture and beautiful weather.

I was thinking I want to create a representation of this area with the side view idea with inspirations to the style coming from the era when these ports would have been at their prime.

This style I'm kinda thinking about is Classical oil landscape paintings but I have to think about how abstract how I might want to be.

The first pattern I have created is a bezier geometric pattern but also functions as a visual effect where the focus on one point, the others move.
