### Parametric Face

This program generates a set of parametric mummies' faces base on the random parameters: the width of face, the shape of mouth, the size of eyes, the height of eyebrows, the angle of eyebrows and whether they have noses. The choice of colours are basic black and white and the shapes of face are minimalist design which leads audiances to focus more on the emotional outcome.

The layout is a fixed grid because there is interesting pattern made by the negative space. All parameters are generated by pseudorandom and follow the following rules:


- The shape of mouth are usually oblate.

- The eyes are usually big, but it is possible to have small eyes.

- Most of the time face will have nose (80%). It is rare that face doesn't have nose (20%).

- There are more likely to be the median for other parameters.
