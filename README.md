## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I got the pattern inside the diamond working - I used an alternative version of my original pattern from previous commits. The zoom levels are now as follows:

1. original pattern
2. dark diamond added
3. diamond is lightened, inner lines of main pattern is added.
4. diamond is lightened again
5. second pattern is added
6. inner line of second pattern is added

The only issue I have is that because my method of drawing the secondary pattern is just covering the whole page (but drawn the same colour as the background so that it looks like it's only on top of the diamond), so when the orange inner is added, if you aren't focussed on the diamond, or have an edge of the diamond in the canvas, the orange pattern will continue on over the rest of the canvas and be visible. I'm not sure if this really bothers me. I could just get rid of other elements that are drawing so that at this level the only thing drawing is the new pattern, but I don't know if it's so big of an issue that it needs to have a fix, as the other elements on the page get so big at this point, so it gives some interest to the rest of the canvas outside of the diamonds.
