## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I have decided to dedicate this project to, are my pets, both lost and living. The project encouraged us to create and generate work that has meaning to us, and rather than using photographs of myself, my friends, family or hobbies, I've decided to go in a direction that is sometimes overshadowed by life itself, our pets. Regardless of what we're going through and how busy our lives are, our pets are always there for us, so for this project I have decided to shine light on the animals we chose to bring in our lives, and pay tribute everything they bring us. 

Overall I am happy with my final iterations and believe that I have created work that is to the best of my abilities.
