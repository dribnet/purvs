## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters are going to be created in the shape of a digital alarm clock and be drawn from a series of lines. I want my alphabet to look like its made out of neon lights. This has already created a design issue that will need to be fixed where only 1 of the letters the "C" is showing correctly while the others are blurred far too much.


The 5 parameters per letter:
  * left : Left line of the shape
  * top : top line of shape
  * right : right line of shape
  * middle : middle line of shape
  * bottom : bottom line of shape
