## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I have redesigned my alphabet I relooked at how to I wanted my original idea to look like. Instead of trying to create a bubble look by only using ellipses I moved to only using 3 lines. This helps create the minimal look I hoped to accomplish in my original design but this is much more fun, readable and simple which I really like.

1: I used a Stroke weight variable to change the size of the line to crate almost ellipses, this line will be a bright blue.

2: Another thin line with a stroke weight of 30 this time with bright blue colour.

3: A thin line with the background colour to create nagative space with a stroke weight of 30.
