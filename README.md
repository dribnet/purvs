## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I edited the mask again to show more light because the original seemed boring and mismatched. I have changed the shapes to be a hexagon for the majority of the pixels and triangles for the bright patches of light. and also changed the sizes to that the images are shown in a higher resoution.
