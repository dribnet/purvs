This is my Alphabet, I'm still thinking about how to do the "?" with my design.

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second rectangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
