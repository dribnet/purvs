Each of my letters is composed with two ellipses. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location, width, height, and degree of rotation of the second circle is controlled by 5 parameters.

The five parameters per letter:
  * `smallWidth` : width of the small ellipse
  * `smallHeight` : height of the small ellipse
  * `smallAngle` : degree of rotation of the small ellipse
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the small ellipse relative to the big circle
  * `offsety` : y offset of the small ellipse relative to the big circle
