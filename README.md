## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For my theme I am leaning on the idea of the cultural enviroment taking over the natural enviroment. Merely touching on the idea of pollution and how we are destroying our earth.


I have imported my own images and used the sample code given in class and changed it. So far I have done all 3 of my images with masks and replaced the old cartoon ones I was experimenting with earlier. I am now going to experiment with the code to create abstract images of my 3 imported images to get more ideas.
