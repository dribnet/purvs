PS1 MDDN 342 2017

I've added some variation in the color of the faces. I've kept the skin color completely random, as I didn't want to favour any one tone but rather have a range of different ones for the program to choose from.

I have also focussed the random variable that controls how far open the eyes are. This means that a much lower percentage of my population has their eyes shut, allowing  for more variation of expression in the sketch (as the faces with closed eyes look more or less the same as each other).
