## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - Grid Techniques

Changed my middle photo from a picture at a resort to a city picture in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to match the other two.
I've purposely chosen city pictures all taken at night time to accentuate the night lights in all these cities.

I've updated all 3 images to draw using my current algorithm.
Next I think I will mask the sky in all 3 of the images to establish a consistent pattern.
I'll also test out some new patterns.
