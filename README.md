## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

colour update:
i thought the pink looked a bit washed out compared to the yellow and blue, so i upped the saturation a bit and adjusted the other values to match. 
I think it stands out more and looks way more coherent. also the 2nd colour again also looked a bit close to the 1st for the previous, and now with the change i think it definitely looks different now. 
Im very happy with these colours here and i don't think i'll change it again!!
