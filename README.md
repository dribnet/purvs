Theme
Water cycle

I chose three image from three different weather to explain my theme. 


Elements
Water goes through different forms: liquid, solid (snow) and vapor. The rain will drop on the ground. The river consist of water. Finally, the water will become vapor. 

In this part, arc means rain. The white elements reflect snow. The little dot is for water vapour.  


My Design
The first image is about raining at dusk. This is my favorite one. The colors can define each part of the design. Also, the smooth change of the sky color is different from my third image. It isn't as agressive as the last one. The little dots can be seen clearly in the land part. The bright colors in the middle position reflect the result of raining on the land.  

The second image talks about water cycle from a peaceful summer afternoon. The arc elements take the biggest propotion of the image. We can see only a few snowflowers in the image. And they are not really recognizable.  

The third image is showing storm. I was trying to utilize the darkness of the sky to demonstrate the atmosphere before storm. Also, the grey stone of the sky can tell the coldness. We can see a contrast between the sky stone and land part (such as the orange rect).


Smartmask
Because there are two parts in my input images. One of them is the sky. Another one is the land. They are not specific objects. And I checked the masking categories. It didn't mention the sky or the land. Therefore, I didn'y use smartmask in this project.
