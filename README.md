PS1 MDDN 342 2017

For face number one I wanted to explore how far basic features could be pushed without losing the objective beauty of the face. I used a cartoon aesthetic in order to avoid a creepy, uncanny valley situation. If I take this idea further, I would like to look more into the golden ratio and what variances can be allowed within it without distorting the features beyond recognition as a face. 

For my second face, I wanted to create something closer to my own drawing style, which heads more in the direction of realism. It's far from finished, but I figured I would do more of a 'proof of concept' type thing rather than try to resolve the design immediately. With this face, I wanted to explore the idea of parameterised emotion. I do a fair bit of 3D modelling, and so the techniques behind facial rigging and blend shapes were something that have been playing on my mind. I wanted to familiarize myself with parameterised expression in 2D in order that my 3D work is better informed. If I take this concept further, I will add more features (mouth, nose, etc), and also rework the parameters so that each slider controls one of the 4 core emotions). I would also like to develop the visual style in order that it better reflects my own art style, with reference to sketchy lines and maybe even hatched shading.
