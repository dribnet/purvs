## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I've started with moving away from my project 3 and developing something with a little more detail. I did like my 3rd proejct but feel as if this concept idea will look better and more compex than if I carried on but I don't know if I am making this too hard for myself considering I will have to begin with new code!

I think this idea of snowflakes falling and as you zoom, you are able to see more detail! I've always been interested in the originalilty of different snowfalkes and I think it would bring an intertesting thing to this project through making each snowflake different.
