I incorperated my cloud code and I found drawing arcs in this code layout is a lot harder and more time consuming. I just drew one to start to get the hang of it and at the moment it is drawn really close to the parachuter. When I tried to move it, I ran into a few problems with translate and changing the values so I think I'll wait for more tutorials before I try more technical things.
