## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my final collection of output images. I chose to showcase one of my favourite places in the country, Tauranga Bay in the Far North District near Kaeo.
I did this because I feel like by living in the city people tend to lose their 'connection' to nature of sorts, especially if you live and work within the city, which is something I've noticed when I am living in Wellington compared to back home in Northland.

I wanted to make use of the fact that my work could be exhibited on a billboard in the very center of the city, both by highlighting my favourite place, but also by bringing something naturally beautiful into the city.

I'm hoping that through these images the people viewing them will be able to view the sea and nature in a similar way to me, seeing the beauty not only in the sunrises or sunsets, but also when the sky is grey and the weather isn't too amazing, and even just by looking at the sea and appreciating the colours and strength it has.

Initially I was planning on doing something with my images where I separated the land, sea, and sky by creating little symbols in the code to represent each area, e.g. land would have a tree, sea would have a wave.
However whilst experimenting with trying to get this output I came upon an output that reminded me of the impressionism art movement, which is one of my personal favourite art movements.

I decided that because my images are both of the sea (water), something that many impressionist artists enjoyed painting, and also feature light in some way (my first output with the strong sunset, second with the dull grey, and third with the reflections in the water) I could really lean into making my images look similar to an impressionist piece of art.
Upon coming to this decision I did some research for art pieces and artist precedents that I could use to really inform my design.

If I were to do this again I would probably spend some more time waiting for the right time to take my photos to get the mood I wanted, as for my second output what I really wanted was a stormy sea as I would have loved to show appreciation for both a calm sea and a stormy one, as I personally love watching the sea during a storm. Unfortunately I wasn't at Tauranga Bay when the weather began to get very stormy and thus couldn't get the image I wanted. I feel that this was also due to time constraints, as if I had waited for stormy weather I would not have had enough time to work on perfecting my code so it looked great on all outputs.
