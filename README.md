## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I was able to get my mask and grid to work to make the pixels look more defined, I am happy with the outcome and look of how this looks. I am pretty happy with how my dragonfly and hearts are looking, after playing around with the colour through code. I need to work on the symbol in the second image because the moons did not look clean enough not matter what I did, same with the butterflies.

I have experimented a lot with the size of the pixels to make sure I have gotten the right look, I also managed to get rid a lot of the black cast that I had previously. So far I am pretty happy with how it is looking, I just need to make some final refinements and work on my second image.
