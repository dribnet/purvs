## PS4

The first layer of zoom detail was added at zoom level of 3 or higher. The detail features white rings circulating the outside of the star. This is an abstract way of showing information such as orbits. 

The standard amount of rings is two, but the possibility for a single ring, three rings, and even four rings is available. The spacing between the rings is also based on noise so each star will have unique orbits around them.

I have run into a slight clipping effect that happens on some star rings the closer you get. Sometimes this is an issue with odd visuals, but additionally sometimes it produces very interesting visuals on the rings with various arcs of different lengths. I spent some time trying to fix it with no success, but I do not think it is too big of an issue.
