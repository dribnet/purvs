### Spiral Clock

I based this off the 4th Maeda clock. I chose cyan and pink, two of my
favourite colours to have the clock switch between. I used variables for
the R, G, B and opacity values and used a for loop to iterate through these,
the seconds, the translation and the rotation of the text. In future I wish
I could have used a different font (one more similar to the original) to
better capture the feel of the Maeda clock.
