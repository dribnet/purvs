Each of my letters is composed with four triangles. each point of my triangles are controlled by 6 parameters each.


An example of the code for one triangle:

  * `offsetx1 tri 1` : x offset of the first triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety1 tri 1` : y offset of the first triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsetx2 tri 1` : x offset of the second triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety2 tri 1` : y offset of the second triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsetx3 tri 1` : x offset of the third triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety3 tri 1` : y offset of the third triangle point relative to the center

  this is the same for the other 3 triangles with different offset names 

I have completed all my letters and have added the interpolation code to add the movement between letters. The only thing left is for me to play with the interpolation code to give the transitions a more unique movement.

I have chosen to call my font RazerArk as the letters have very sharp points like a razer.
