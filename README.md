This is a coded sketch of A, B and C. I simplified it massively because it was really confusing me. Previously I had attempted to creat a Maze type of code where my shape would travel and the wall of the grid would be removed so that the letter I wanted could be formed. To accomplish this I looked at the coding train's maze video, however once I developed the code I got confused. I over complicated it. Next I formed an array which I was going to use to create my grid, however that would not work with the code we were given. Therefore, I have stripped the code down to basic's. From here I need to alter it to fit the 12 parameters. Also I think it would be interesting to have the green morph underneath the grid rather then suddenly appeare within it. One thing I do like significantly about this sketch is the colours. I am going for a computer-ish/ similar to matrix look, therefore these colours work nicely.

My parameters at the moment are;

box1();
box2();
box3();
box3();

...etc (All are functions).
