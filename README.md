## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I have added extra grids on different levels of zoom. You first see large clouds which you can zoom through to reveal the parachuters and smaller clouds. When you get close enough to them the details show up as well as a second layer of smaller parachuters in the distance. 

This has made loading take a little bit longer because it is drawing a lot more than it needed to before. 

I still want to add more detail to the parachuters. I think textures on the fabrics will be effective but might slow the code down significantly. I also might have trouble drawing the texture patterns within the the shapes of the fabrics.
