## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

SKETCH: For my sketch I used 3 different shapes (a triangle, square and circle) as the background for my letters, each in a different colour. Then there is a foreground triangle that has been scaled and rotated to create negative space in the letter and some lines on the side. 


EXAMPLE 1: The first version of the alphabet uses only circles, triangles and squares. At this point the letters are very abstract and some look quite similar to each other. Therefore, for the next version of my alphabet I am going to start using both vertical and horizontal lines to make sure the letters are both readable and distinguishable.


EXAMPLE 2: I have now completed the second version of my alphabet by adding vertical and horizontal lines to some of the letters. I only have two parameters left for my next development but i am thinking of adding either colour or another smaller cicrle for letters such as p, 6 and 9

working on circle parameter and need to change interpolation


The parameters per letter:
  * `backgroundShapeType` : the type of the background shape (triangle, circle, sqaure)
  * `backgroundShapeRotate` : the rotation of the background shape
  * `trianglePosX` : x position of the foreground traingle
  * `trianglePosY` : y postion of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleRotate` : roation of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleSize` : size of the foreground triangle
  * `lines1VerticalXpos` : the x postion of the vertical lines
  * `lines2HorizontalYpos` : the y postion of the first horizonatal lines
  * `lines3HorizontalYpos` : the y postion of the second horizonatal lines
  * `linesHorizonalRotate` : the rotation of the horizonatal lines
