## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Episode 04 THEME REVISED

the general theme shows three pathways both showing in the day and night. But the three pathways all connect into one big alleyway path, that interconnects a large portion of my commute to the train station as a student, and day or night, i always have to cross these paths to reduce the time i have to get to the station. Personally this pathway has saved me time in numerous occasions especially if your a student who always procrastinates.

-take photos (REVISED)
-make theme (REVISED)
-experiment further with the code... more to go

(fixed the small random dash line above the images).
