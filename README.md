So my idea is to use characters (such as the chinese, japanese and korean text) as reference. I thought it would be interesting to try and recreate those types of characters for the project. I plan to add some ellipses to the characters as well to make it look a bit more interesting. I thought of this after looking at korean texts as they seem to have a lot of these 'O' like shapes in their characters. Might change colours and such later.
