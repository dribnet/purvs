## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

As of right now I do not know what kind of image I will go for. I believe I may go for something like landscapes and city skylines or even portraits.
Currently I have a image of Scarlett Johansson that I edited years ago, an image of my MDDN241 Porject 2 model, and Vincent Van Gogh's famous starry night.
