Tom and I tried to add in some random variables to be able to randomise the snowflakes. We are still working on adjusting the code to get it to work so right now nothing has really changed other than within the code. I'm wokring outside of the code to try and draw up what I would like the snowflakes to look like and be randomised around in order for it to be easier when it comes to drawing it within the code. It'll also make it easier to know eaxctly what I can and can't do too.
