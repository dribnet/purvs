The name of my font is called ANGLES Font

it consists of a static line at a 45 degree and and 2 right angles that move around it forming different letters and numbers of the alphabets.

I tried experimenting with the interpolation animations however i found it extremely difficult finding a way to smoothly transition them, in particular adding additional rotation offsets to the right angles. However overall i am happy with what i have produced.

If i were to re-do the project. I would like to change the main elements of the font and use a different primitive shape like a circle or triangle. I would also use a different colour palette.
