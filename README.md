## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

These were the pictures I created using the SmartMask. I used the cat, elephant and cow tags to create the different mask for the pictures. I used the list smart mask for the cow picture to mask only the three cows instead of all four. I think creating masks in photoshop (even though more time consuming) produces a better result when having a small pixel size as you can see if there are any errors with the mask.
