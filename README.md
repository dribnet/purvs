For this project I explored a grid layout design inspired by Art Deco and Art Nouveau styles. These styles are shown through my use of colour (golds) and use of shapes (curved and straight). 

In my final design I took out the sliders and focused on having a new design on each click. 

For my landscape design I wanted to continue on the same style as my pattern so I took a more abstract interpretation. The grey areas are like clouds and the curved organic style is more influenced by art nouveau. I wanted to show a clear contrast like a merge of the two styles side by side. The golden rectangles (sometimes also grey) represent buildings so I made them less curved. 

For my pattern design I included layering similar to that shown in Art deco. My design is more rounded and organic compared to the typical Gatsby / Art Deco works. Here I wanted to show a nice depth of field to give my pattern a more 3d look. That way the pattern is considered to be different as you zoom in or out.

In the future I would like to include more variety in colours, like blue for instance which would appear rarely to make my designs more interesting. I would also explore adding more depth of field to my landscape design.
