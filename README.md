## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

For my sketch I used 3 different shapes (a triangle, square and circle) as the background for my letters, each in a different colour. Then there is a smaller triangle that has been scaled and rotated to create negative space in the letter and some lines on the side. 

I have now started working on my full alphabet 


The parameters per letter:
  * `backgroundShapeType` : the type of shape
  * `colour` : the colour of the background shape
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `triangleRotate` : roation of the smaller triangle
  * `triangleSize` : size of the smaller triangle
  * `leftLineLength` : the length of lines on the left side
