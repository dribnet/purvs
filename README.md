## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme - Light and Shadow

The theme I chose was light and shadow, which is a silhouette shot. Everyone has two sides, just like the existence of opposites of light and shadow. They are inseparable and cannot exist alone. However, these two things are always opposites. 

My inspiration comes from the hand-shadow game that we often play when we were young, the hand is projected on the wall and then made into different animal shapes by hand. But I think that if only the shadow of the clap is projected on the wall will be too monotonous, so I chose the combination of shadow and landscape. 

In order to express my theme nicely,  I have to make a very sharp contrast between my shadow and the landscape. So my mask is based on the two most contrasting colors of shadow and landscape. 

Light and shadow shooting does not require too much to modify it, or it will destroy the overall balance. So based on this principle, I did not give too much modification to the pixel, I chose the most straightforward and simple way - straight line.  This is just one of the reasons for me. The bigger reason is that below the light, a description of the outline of a shadow which means under the illumination of light, the outline of the shadow should be very prominent, which can achieve a good visual effect. Overall, I am quite satisfied with my final output.
