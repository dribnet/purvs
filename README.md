## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

Successfully got the quad to cross over so the quad in the X and the 8 look much better. I tried to use this with the 3 and it looks a little better I think.

I've also been slightly tweaking lettters to make them look better.

The 16 parameters per letter:
  * `Yshift1` : top of line position for first line
  * `Yshift2` : top of line position for second line
  * `Yshift3` : top of line position for third line
  * `Yshift4` : top of line position for fourth line   

  * `length1` : length bottom of line position for first line
  * `length2` : length bottom of line position for second line
  * `length3` : length bottom of line position for third line
  * `length4` : length bottom of line position for fourth line


  * `Xquad1` : x position of first quad point
  * `Xquad2` : x position of second quad point
  * `Xquad3` : x position of third quad point
  * `Xquad4` : x position of fourth quad point

  * `Yquad1` : y position of first quad point
  * `Yquad2` : y position of second quad point
  * `Yquad3` : y position of third quad point
  * `Yquad4` : y position of fourth quad point
