## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


I decided it was time to try some new photographs for my theme. In particular I want something that has a plainer background that I can get quite creative with, & a simply outlined foreground shape so that it can be abstracted a bit more as well, while it's still clear what the image is portraying. In terms of theme I was looking for something outdoors as the enviroment is very important to me, & if possible involved people having fun. This is actually a photo I took over summer of my boyfriend playing with a soccer ball at the beach. I think it fits well with the requirements i have, & I definietely think I can develop it into a theme with the way I manipulate the pixels & the other images I include. I have hundreds of similar photos from the same day so plenty to pick from.

Strcking with the linear style background I made it more full by spreading the lines evenly across the pixel so they never clump in the centre & leave the outside looking sparse. When testing some variable options I noticed it looked similar to pencil lines or brush strokes, so I thickened the width of the line, & thinned the length so it looks like lots of short, fast strokes. When looking from afar it almost looks like fabric as well.

I added a few gradient changes to the foreground, gives it sort of an embossed feel, but it doesn't fit with the background.

I tried using smartmask. It worked well at selecting indivdual objects, but I can get a much clearer selection using photoshop. There are some parts of the foreground that I would have preferred to be background but they were selected by smartmask
