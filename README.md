Finalised landscape sketch and added in a mode function to switch between them. I have added another layer into the landscape sketch. This one draws slightly less and is lighter to add to the depth of the building. I have also added in some ellipses for variance in the building arcitcture. On top of this I gave the rectangles slight curved corners as this is more asthetically apealing. I am happy with how this has turned out as, although it doens't quite have the same effect as a greeble, I think when this is used as a displacement map it will effectively generate a city structure. To do this I will need to change it to greyscale first.
