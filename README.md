## PS2 MDDN 342 2017


README for part3.

I have added features to make the faces appear silly but also incorporating elements from the devil so I can portry well known, serious and maybe slightly evil characters in a way that makes fun of them. Elements such as horn length and colour, hair size, head shape, mouth size, eye size and direction and whether a moustache is present are all being trained to hopefully react to the image placed in the file.
I have been training the code to hopefully recognise these features, and apply them to photos of dictators from throughout history which I have placed in the .json file.

I am struggling with bugs i the code which are causing the quiz to not work very well and some features not saving.
