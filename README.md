--Wallpaper--
The wallpaper uses simple rects and lines
to create a detailed pattern. It uses the same shapes
as the landscape, but colored and sized differently.

The color scheme is neon and bright, randomly changing between 3 color schemes.
taking inspiration from future japanese night lighting. The goal of this wallpaper
is to create an aesthetically pleasing composition using simple shapes to create
a complex pattern.

--Landscape--

The landscape uses a similar minimalist aesthetic to the wallpaper, but is this time
black and white and focused on conveying symbols that represent a top-down environment.
It uses simple shapes to represent things like trees and rocks. Each type of terrain
has its own probability of spawning, which is changed each time
