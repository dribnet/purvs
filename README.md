### 4th Dimension

Explanation of Notes from left column top to bottom then right coloumn top to bottom. 

Notes on things that I wanted to implement, rotation/oscillation and how they relate to clocks. 

Notes on how things in our world our rendered and how we are able to visually see them based on research in quantum physics or something I forgot. 

A note on Slit Scanning, something that i've been interested in since summer. Essentially a 2D render of a 4D object. 

Notes on Edwin Abbott Analogy of how the 4th Dimension could be seen.
Relates to how 3D objects are seen in 2D as these slits. if a sphere passed through it would start off small incrementally grow large and once it reached its maximum x/z would reduce in size till gone.

Right column is precedents for 4D stuff.

What I wanted to do with 4D was have a 4D object, take a 3D slice of it since seeing a 4D object is incomprehensible and project it in 2D similiar to the game Miegakure which has a better explanation of 4D.
