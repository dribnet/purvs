my letters was inspired by paper cutting and geometric shapes, and its consist of two triangles that overlapped a rectangle.

I changed the background color from blue to green, also I finished the alphabets and the number, each of the style is based on geometry. 
The twelve parameters per letter:
  * 
  * `gx` : x offset of the first triangle relative to the first point
  * `gy` : y offset of the first triangle relative to the first point
  * `1x` : 1x offset of the first triangle relative to the second point
  * `1y` : 1y offset of the first triangle relative to the second point
  * `2x` : 2x offset of the first triangle relative to the third point
  * `2y` : 2y offset of the first triangle relative to the third point

  * `3x` : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the first point
  * `3y` : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the first point
  * `4x` : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the second point
  * `4y` : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the second point
  * `5x` : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the third point
  * `5y` : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the third point

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].
