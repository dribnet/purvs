## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

  March 23
  Today in class we got introduced to project two. To start with we made our own A B C letters in a different style.
  When messing with the code I changed a lot of the colours, changed the circles to squares and messed with moving the squares around and changing the sizes.
  For this project I want to create an abstract alphabet.
  Each of my letters is composed of one or two squares, The pink squares are stationary for now but the size and movement of the blue squares is controlled by the three parameters that were originally in the code. I added a fourth and fifth parameter to control a third smaller square within each letter.

  The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : size of the second sqaure
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the pink squares
  * `offsety` : y offset of the pink squares
  * 'offsetx2' : x offset of the green/blue squares
  * 'offsety2' : y offset of the green/blue squares
  * 'smallXPos' : x position of the FIRST dark blue square
  * 'smallYPos' : y position of the FIRST dark blue square
  * 'smallXPos2' : x position of the SECOND dark blue squares
  * 'smallYPos2' : y position of the SECOND dark blue squares

  In class we moved our starting sketch to the draw letters js and the letters js, I spent most of the lesson organising my code and figuring out how to make each aspect move how I want, I also made the pink squares into a variable that I can move how I want rather than it being in the same place between each letter.

  In class I continued making each letter and learnt how to use the editor, it made making new letters so much easier. I started working on the interaction of the letters too. I changed the background colour just as a temporary thing so I could see the changes I was making easier.

  Today I figured out how to make my letters move smoothly between each other, previously my letters had moved in a very clunky way as not every letter used every parameter. I fixed this by making sure each letter uses every parameter, if I didnt want a parameter shown I doubled it over with its pair parameter. Most of the parameters I had to deal with were the 'smallYPos2 and smallXPos2' parameters. Now my letters move smoothly. 
  I also finished the first trial of all of my letters, currently I'm unsure if I will change much.

Came into class during the break to finish all my alphabet + numbers, I did this successfully, I am now trying to edit each of my front covers and put in the numbers for the purview page. I also need to figure out how to add a star background to my piece, I was thinking that I could make a PNG file of a star background that I make on illustrator that I can size up and down on the Sublime file to fit each setting.
