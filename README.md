## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've been working on the first image for this commit. I really liked the lines idea that Phoebe showed in the tutorial video so I decided to chuck that in and see what it looked like. It looked really, really good. I applied it both in/out of my mask, with the mask layer having shorter lines. This works really well with the near monocolour look of the original image- the lack of strong contrast means that everything just blends together, but the shorter lines on the face give enough definition to see what Cathal looks like. One idea that I do want to make more prominent (and I need to check that this is ok first) is to include some sort of text saying (WASTE EP - GAJUAR). After all, if my theme is putting a spotlight on local artists, and this image is going to be on a billboard, I want to promote their latest release. I do have the text being drawing with the shorter lines, but they are just getting covered by the long lines being drawn over top, so I think I'm going to try something else (maybe horizontal lines over top?) I did try making the mask layer greyscale using filter(GRAY), but couldn't get it to apply to just the masked layer, and not the whole image (I used push/pop, put the mask layer into a second function, still didn't work). It's okay though, because I really like the blended thin line effect on the current output. One final weird thing that's happening is that the render is not stopping. I lowered the amount in the for statement down to 1000 and the amount of times it renders down to just 1, but it still just keeps rendering and the console.log (done!) doesn't show up.
