My design was inspired by Chinese Zodiac Clock.
Each of the animals symblized one sepcific time.
It starts from Rat, so I made it as 12,24.
The total order is Rat, Pig, Dog, Rooster, Monkey, Sheep, Horse, Snake, Dragon, Rabbit, Tiger and OX.
I also add the eight diagram to point out when is A.M and P.M.
