this is my inital sketch idea of how I might do my letters. I am planning on expanding this idea and seeing what other parameters i can add/use to enhance this idea and make it more interesting. 

Each of my letters is composed with 3 circles. each representing a letter (circle 1= A , circle 2=B , circle 3= C). I have then adding 3 rectangle boxes that I can position and tilt to cut into the circles to create a chape that resembles these letters. each of my parametes allow me to move and position these boxes. for example the direction, size and placement. I have kept the original 3 parameters that came with the code to experiment with. I have added rotation as a paramete so i am able to angle the objects. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * 'rotate': this determinds the angle of the object
