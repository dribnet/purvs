## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of books I have read. The masks for each photo highlight various objects.

I have changed the coloured of the of the rectangles used for the background-black mask. As all of my three images had a different background colour, though I wanted to them to be the same, as it helped show the theme more. So I added a fill and a stroke, so it would change the colour of the rectangles used. I played around with different colours, but I had to make sure the colour used worked for all three images. the colour I went with is a bluegrey, as I found it went with all three images.
