## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


The theme for this project I went with was 'friendship' I selected this because I think it is very important to have and carry since the people I've made friends with shaped to the person I am today.

The three collages are skating, pool, and university. These three I think had the most influence on me and I had photos of. So I decided to choose these. Each image carries some sort of value, like for skating the indivdual smiling is because he landed a trick, the other hes attempting a trick, and the most important image of the skating one is the bottom. Where we all had our skateboards and took a photo to remember what we were like (4 years ago).

There were some diffuculties, such as why some images weren't rendering and why some things didn't load. These issues were quickly resolved as they were something pretty minor like why I couldn't render because I wasn't on the local server and I forgot to mask some indivdual parts of a photo. In the final image you are able to see a difference as you can see a blur which was kinda intentional, but I left it with that one because I think it looked the best with that one.

I didn't use the masking program as I found photoshop alot easier to use and there were some areas where I wanted to selected specifally without the program autoamtically picking it. I did do the technical exercice but didn't save.

The code is quite simple and basic but that's what I wanted. I wanted to create a minor pixel effect so there is something and you can still see the images almost clearly because I think it is the images is what symbolizes the theme. For the patterns I wanted to do for each topic like an 8 ball, skateboard/wheels, or expressions but I ran out of time to actually achieve that as I underestimated time. So I used simple ellipes with no fill and made the patterns really small. The colour for the backgrounds were simply chosen because it looked the best with the photos. 

Overall this project I enjoyed because I got to explore old/new photos and select a theme which I liked. There were many themes but I liked this one the most because it is very signicant.
