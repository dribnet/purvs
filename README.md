## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

So I haven't had a whole lot of time to work on the project, hence the lack of updates. This should change for the remainder of this week though.

Anyway, currently I am building out the alphabet. At this point in time they are all there. I did have all the letters done previous, but they were super basic and I decided to scrap them and restart. I have also been messing with lines like the colours and line widths to help with readability. Currently I am liking how this looks and will continue to move forward with this style, refining it over the week.

Current Paramters Are:
  * lines : an array of 1s and 0s that let the line algroithm know whether or not to "light up" or "turn on" a particular line
  * letterColour : Contains the letters colour
