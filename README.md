## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In this project 3 we need to make some pixel photos. and on that time the city is still in level 2, so I was use some past photo, I choose some nature pictures and use three best of them.

The topic of my project 3 is “Wonderland”, I use 3 nature picture for the basic picture and input image. Then I make 3 fairy masks and use different poses and effects to show the fantasy and beauty. 

When I inputed the first image, the render image looks verry strenge, and the pattern is not what i expected, so I was thinking how to make it looks interesting. before that i was choose environment as the theme, after that i want to change the theme to something else. I try to add some patterns in the mask by photoshop not coding. after i got the render picture, the image doesn't looks good, so I change the fill color from "pix" to white color just for test, and it was changed a little bit but the pattern shape is still rect and circle, so i change the pattern to a star make by lines. so i got a image with white buterflies, but still feel lost something, it is hard to findout what do i need. One day when i watching some animations i realise i need add a character. and the render image doesn't look like an earth environment, so i try to find some character that is not from earth, fantasy World is one of them and i really like the fairy's design. So i make three fairy character shade in to the mask. in the second image i want to make something different with first image, so i delete the buterfly and try to add some thing else, one of my idea is elf, some little life with light, and this idea is perfect with the star pattern. However, if the elf is stay on the image without rule, it is terrible, so i make a stright line in the mask, the image looks better but it doesn't look like a life, so i change the stright line to a curve line and it will around with the fairy, and that make it looks good.

I show the picture to my friend, and they said i need a transition between white part to the black part, so i have four different mask colours. from four colours i have a new idea for the last mask, i make a 4 lines from centre to the outside, so it is different with other two. However if it is only a fairy shot four lines to the out side doesn't make scence, then i make a mistake, it was draw a short line between two lines from that i was thinking make a space, not line, so i add a mask shade between each two lines and use different colour to fill the image pattern. that is how i make the theme and design my project. 

In the first image, I chose a shot of the lake behind the trees, I make some leaves mask on the trees part and the direction of the leaves on the right side and left side are different. on the centre of the picture, I make a fairy who stay on the lake and there are some butterflies around her. I want use first image to make a peaceful and fantasy feeling. And behind the trees is feel like someone come to this place in the first time.

The second image is a fairy sit on kind of lines. I use a ellipse mask in this image, so it can clearly show the focus point in the picture. I use 2 lines around the fairy, and use star as the pattern so it looks fantasy. I use soft curve and lone distance on these lines so it looks relived and freedom. The fairy is sit on the lines looks peaceful and comfortable.

The last image is my favourite one. I dray some lines from centre to outside, and each two lines make areas, I use two different style and colour on these areas so it look like different Worlds, I still use soft line in these image, and those lines is start from fairy’s hand it look like she can control everything, in this image I want to show a beautiful and powerful feeling.

For the mask, I was try to make the mask that only have black and white, then I want to make some interesting images, so I try to draw some butterflies and curve lines in grey, however it didn’t change to much so I draw some fairy in the mask and use another colour to make the change. so for the final masks I use 4 colours: black, white, dark grey and light gray.
