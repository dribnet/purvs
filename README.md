## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

**FONT NAME: PINKNESS**

I decided to call my alphabet “Pinkness”, simply because the colour consists of pink, except for white. My alphabet was inspired by mathematical symbols and incorporates elements that have the viewer use their eyes to “connect the dots” in a letter. In this case, the circles are meant to be connected and to the lines for the letters, but this solely depends on the letter. Approaching this method was simple for letters such as, “A”, “W”, “M”, “L”, “H”, “F”, etc. - Letters that generally consist of straight lines. However, I had some difficulty with more curved letters such as “S”, “O”, “Q”, etc. Due to the limited parameters and shapes, I approached the curved letters differently. I used bigger circles to represent the curved edges and tried to work my around variation through the lines.

In this alphabet, the following represent:

**Two lines side by side** represents that these do not need to be connected and are generally meant to represent the straight line it conveys. This also goes for lines going through a circle and circles in a line.

**One smaller circle** represents that this must be imagined to connect to the line.

**Two smaller circles** represents that these two circles must be connected, so a line can be imagined to connect the two.

**Smaller inner circles** represent differentiation from other similar looking letters, hence why there are very few.

I wanted to approach the numbers differently, so I had the shapes properly connected, to highlight that they’re not letters. This is why circles are connected, such as “2” and “7”, while numbers such as “4” and “5” include original elements where the smaller circles must be joined. “O” and “0” have two lines going through it to represent that there is no need to connect the dots and lines. The difference with these characters is that “O” has a smaller inner circle, to highlight the fact that this is a letter and not a number. ”J” and “Q” have two lines touching its inner circles to represent curviness and missing elements. On a side note, I also tried to keep consistent numbers for my parameters, with the exception for some numbers for a proper look.

“Pinkness” is not necessarily meant to be completely readable, but once understood, it can be clear why the letters look the way they do.

In conclusion, I think I did very well in communicating my concept and worked efficiently given my restricted parameters. I am quite satisfied with my outcome and am very fond of the colour scheme too, as I managed to convey an aesthetic look with the two strokes. This assignment was very enjoyable and probably one of my favourites so far.
