## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

### Concept
In all images the persons is shown in gray scale and the whole sketch is in a 6x6 grid with a 2x2 padding.

My first image is showing a person who is holding his phone and doesn't realize what is going on in his surrounding.
I cutted the head off from the person so that the attention goes to the phone he is holding the hand has also a yellow boarder to show that it is dangerous.

In the second image the person has run against a pole and falls over.

The third image is an experiment where the head is still shown but stronger pixeld.
