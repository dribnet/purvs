## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Sketch of my project2.

So I have an issue about my alphabet display that most of my bounding boxes are off set their position. I checked the console error which said:

DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://ncennffkjdiamlpmcbajkmaiiiddgioo/js/xl-content.js.map: System error: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT

I reckon it's my Chrome's problem and tried to update my browser but failed.

I also did finished my letters design based on my sketch style for now but haven't got time to put them in digit form. I'll fix the bounding box first.
