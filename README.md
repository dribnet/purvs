## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I played around with animating my letters for a while but after recieving feedback from my friends in class they told me that the letter movement was already fluid and clean. I decided to leave it the way it was and carry on adjusting some of my letters. I am ready to hand in now after finally deciding that I have finished, The red and the blue didnt need to change as it complements the black background of my letter canvas and the white background of my exhibition canvas. The white stroke has really brought the colour out and is something I want to keep after trying to decide over night. My default character star also looks really cool and made sure I included my name as well as the default tag in my font names. I decided to end with "Fragment" as it was the first one I chose that made the most sense. It has stayed with me and other people have said that It works well with the triangular stained glass vibe.
