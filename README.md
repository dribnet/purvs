## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I am currently taking Typography, where I've been researching how geometric shapes make up letter forms and today I felt inspired to create my letter forms from geometric shapes in p5.js, I want them be abstract like but still resemble the letter.

For now I want to keep things simple and potentially add detail towards the end when I'm feeling more confident.

Originally I wanted to make use of pop art colours, but I'm thinking of sticking to black and white and maybe experimenting with negative space/contrast.

Most of my parameters do/will include:
- The size of shape
- Width of the shape
- Height of the shape
- Multiple x positions
- Multiple y positions

23/03 - Took me a while to understand the different ways of declaring parameters, calling them and calling the functions.

Homework: I am going to further brainstorm my idea and build on it + work on my sketch.

25/03 - After moving all my code from sketch.js to draw_letters.js and letter.js I started brainstorming my idea further and researching potential ideas. I took a while to understand the draw_letters.js and letters.js
