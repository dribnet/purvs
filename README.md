## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I decided to change the second image again because I added a new statement which highlights the green areas. The green ares of the image (in the white mask) have a bigger stroke than the brown areas. After looking at all three images together, I think I will need to change the palm tree image as well. Although, I do  like how the trunk of the tree looks like a similar texture to a real palm tree.

The first two photos were taken at Kerosine creek, a natural hot-spring in Rotorua. It is one of my favourite places. I love that everything there is so green as it is surrounded by trees.
