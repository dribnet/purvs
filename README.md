## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

This is a system where characters are drawn by the motion of 1-pixel particles
tracing a path between four points that they approach in sequence.

### Changes:

- Committed horrible code-crimes to get the Alphabet to render. Further crimes may be necessary.

### Issues:

- It takes a bit for the alphabet to spin up, not much I can do for that.

### To-Do:

- See if I can perform similar witchcraft on the interpolation pages but I'm not holding my breath
