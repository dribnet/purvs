### Sun Tide Clock

My Clock is based on the sun and tide, I used the sun moving to represent the minutes and the tide rising to represent the seconds. The background colour also changes to represnt the sky to represent the time of day (the colour changes with every hour). At the moment I have got the everything working and am just working on small changes and trying things out.
