Today, I am concerned that my design looks too simliar too others. I think I will start to play around with making the letters more abstract, I think it will help with making my design different and not always having to have things visual in order but my code is in order. I also couldn't manage to get my editor working but I have asked for help in 'hail a tutor' as I believe the sliders will help me a lot

The parameters per letter:

  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `offset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one

  *	`StrokeW` : Weight of the stroke
  *	`opacity` : Colour opacity

  * `offsetx2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offset2x2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset2y2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset3x2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `offset3y2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one
