## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

For my idea I am thinking of expanding from my Art Deco inspired design from PS3. The design is an abstract representation of a city with clouds over it. As you zoom in you can see more of the buildings. It also reveals another layer of rectangles at a different angle. I did this to show more variation in the design.
