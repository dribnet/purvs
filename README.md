## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2
Editor works
I changed the editor.js file a bit so I could have certain sliders set to 0 by default. (and in the end didn't need it)

Added interpolation but it is very, very broken.

A rule I've set for myself is that I can't have a straight 'wave', it needs to bend even if it's just a little bit.
Another rule is to not change wavelength too extremely.

Added more functionality like having negative x and rotation when I need it and shorter wavelengths.
Letters before P didn't have this so I could go back and update these if I could improve them.

Letters I don't like atm (maybe it needs a third wave):
H - lowercase, might need another wave
I - needs its top, another wave
M - feels like it doesn't fit in
Q - ugly
U,V - very similar
W - same as M
