## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Concept:

Create an alphabet inspired by the Bauhaus typography from the 1920's. This type style foucsed on geometric shapes, vibrant colours, balanced layouts with harmony and sans-serif letters in upper case. In my type I am wanting to create this style through using 3 simple shapes, a semi-circle arc, a rectangle and a full circle. Each shape has a different colour similar to the Bauhaus type.


The nine parameters per letter:

- size2: the size of the circle
- X2: the x position of the circle
- Y2: the y position of the circle 
- start2 : angle to start the circle
- end2: angle to end the circle 
- rectX: x position of the rectangle 
- rectY: y position of the rectangle 
- rectH: height of the rectangle 
- rectW: width of the rectangle 
- rotate: rotates the rectangle
- flipX: Arc x to swap numerical value with y
- flipY: Arc y to swap numerical value with x 

  First tutorial for PS2. Getting used to using github desktop and changing files. Made a simple design using arcs as a basis for my design. Also uploaded a variety of different sketch ideas.


  My idea is inspired by bauhaus typography. I looked at the shapes used which include arcs, triangles, and squares. Each letter is made up of 2 arc's, each arc can be altered by position, size and degrees for the amount of rotation of them. So far i have 8 parameters. I could try make the first yellow arc at a fixed position in order to get less parameters. At some point I will try and change the 2nd arc into a triangle. I updated my draw_letters.js and letters.js from sketch.js.

  Further workings on my type include adjusting the colours back to the original idea based on the primary colours from the Bauhaus period. I have made up to the letter L during class today. I am trying to make the font readable but also fun with the colours. Some of the letter such as E and J have been super hard to draw in capital letters. I want to further my designs I think by making them slightly more abstract just due to the Bauhaus style. I also made the yellow arc the basis of all my letters. 

  Here is the link to my pintrest board where I have a few inspiration photos on Bauhaus typography.

  I have kept the yellow arc as the standard shape for all my letters, but as I have gone along in creating my letters, i have found this too be really difficult so I thought i could add in a parameter that flips the arc to face the other direction to help create more shapes for letters such as D. Therefore i have made my own sort of paramters, where I can only flip the shape and not adjust the angles. 

  Finished my first draft of my alphabet. So far i like what it looks like, but some letters like M, N and W need more refining.
