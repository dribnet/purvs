### Pulsing Clock

The clock I chose to recreate was the pulsing clock which alternated. Now me being me, I slighlty misread the prompt and actually made a working version, though slightly altered. As I was working on the code, I realized I could make the numbers pulse in a different way, by breaking them up by the individual blocks which made them up.

I will update this later with a single still image, rather than the working version.
