My Idea for my alphabet has changed into using rectangles to show the letters with their outlines, it's very simple and i will probably edit it as I go on. At the moment there is a minimum of 2 rectangles and a max of 4 to create each letter.

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second rectangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
