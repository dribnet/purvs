## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My font is called Game Over and is inspired by the pixelated aesthetic and colour of retro CRT monitors and arcade video games from the late 20th century.

With this project I wanted to be able to create the illusion of movement with this alphabet even though it is still a static image, hence the blue and red colour splitting and slight blur effect of CRT monitors. The shapes of the letters are very pixelated and blocky which also takes reference from this design style. While the shapes this alphabet is composed of are relatively simple, effective colour and illusion of movement, as well as having an overall sense of cohesiveness and nostalgia will be the main goal.

I have currently finished interpolation and slightly changed the main colour of the letters from white to a slightly more green shade of white to look closer to the retro look of a CRT monitor. In terms of interpolation, I really like how pixelated it has come out and I think it works really well with my overall design aesthetic. Now all I need to do before handing in is a bit of polishing and change a few of the exhibition words.

Each of my letters consists of 10 square pixels in a 5x5 square grid which can be altered by their x and y co-ordinates.

The twenty parameters per letter:
x1 = Pixel 1/10 x co-ordinate position
y1 = Pixel 1/10 y co-ordinate position

x2 = ''
y2 = ''

x3 = ''
y3 = ''

x4 = ''
y4 = ''

x5 = ''
y5 = ''

x6 = ''
y6 = ''

x7 = ''
y7 = ''

x8 = ''
y8 = ''

x9 = ''
y9 = ''

x10 = ''
y10 = ''
