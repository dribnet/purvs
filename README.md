Now that I was happy with the forms of my alphabet/numbers I have experimented with some colour palettes and changed it up quite a bit. I have made the stroke and fill colour of the smaller boxes the same colour as the background, because this gives the illusion of there being no small boxes overlapping the large boxes at all, and instead looks like holes cut out of squares which was a look I was going for all along. I think this change has made my alphabet significantly more legible. I have also removed the yellow and at the moment I am using a pink/blue colour scheme though I plan to experiment with this a bit more. I want my colour scheme to be playful and fun rather then the standard black text on a white background.

Parameters:

  * `sizeB1x` : size of x length of two of the smaller boxes
  * `sizeB1y` : size of y length of two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2x' : size of x length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2y' : size of y length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * `posB1x` : x position of first small square
  * `posB1y` : y position of first small square
  * 'posB2x' : x position of the second small square
  * 'posB2y' : y position of the second small square
  * `posB3x` : x position of the third small square
  * `posB3y` : y position of the third small square
  * 'posB4x' : x position of the fourth small square
  * 'posB4y' : y position of the fourth small square
