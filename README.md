## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2
Each letter used utilizes only 4 shapes. 4 shapes combined can make so many different combinations already, which is why i limited it to 4. 2 lines, a square aand a circle


Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
