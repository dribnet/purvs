## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I am working with is 'Clutter.' I have taken photos of various messy areas around my house that have been left there. 

Several of the images have been edited to have better colours, as the original images were quite flat in terms of colouring.

I have used irregular rectangles to increase the overall chaos of the image. Uncluttered areas are coloured darker to highlight the areas of clutter. Areas of clutter are covered in a thin scribble effect, which appears more natural compared with the hard edges of the background elements. 

The scribble effect, to me, resembles colourful moss that you might see growing on trees. I feel like this comparison only adds to the theme of untidyness, and implies that the clutter has been left like that for quite some time.

I decided not to use Smartmask for my masking as it was not able to pick up things that I needed it to pick up. I decided to manually create my masks as it lets me get every small thing that I want to add to the mask.
