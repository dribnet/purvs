## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Updated Masks and Experimented with Colour

As mentioned in my last update I decided to make my last two masks simpler as it made it difficult to render the smaller details. I have also managed to make the detail of the images more visible by adjusting the pointSize & stroke weights. I am much happier with how the details turned out. I will continue experimenting with it further to see what other shapes I can use to make it look interesting.

My images do take a few seconds longer to render because I wanted a lot of pixels to ensure the detail of the leaves show.

I have also started experimenting with changing the colours. No matter what the first image always seems to work better with any the code changes, while the last two images I have to carefully consider how it will be affected by the code. I like how the change of colour in the first image made it a bit more appealing to look at. I do find the second image with the pink details on the leaf the most lacking out of the three images. But I do love how the third image of the ivy leaves feel like a nostalgic photo due to the colour change of the shadows.
