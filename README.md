## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2
I've now updated every individual character and fixed the letters.js file to work with my parameters.
The three parameters per letter:
  * `lenA` : the length of the first line (line A)
  * `lenB` : the length of the second line (line B)
  * `leanB` : how much line B leans, or the x offset of it's top vertex
Testing the exhibition.html site, it is obvious that my font is excruciatingly painful to read. It looks more like a bad loss meme than a set of english characters. It would be pretty cool for some alien font though because after working with it for long enough you can familiarise yourself with the characters and there probably would be some readability then. Otherwise, I'm probably going to change up my design a bit.
