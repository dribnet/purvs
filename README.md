## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Now I changed my code into tiling every pixel one by one. I set the "lastVersion" function so that I could quickly preview my pixels after each time I change the code. 
For my theme I want to do and the photo I want to shoot next, I plan to do something that let people stay positive and find the small happiness next to them which they ignored before. I am not sure what kind of photo could express this theme but I will start to shoot my daily life to represent the small happiness.
