## Powers of 10 PRINT

### Part 1

1. Groupings of small ellipses not unlike the stars in my PS3 atop of a green/dark blue background
2. Mountain shapes become apparent instead of the green/dark blue background
3. Ellipses change to become the crystal-like columns in my PS3
4. Increased detail on the columns and full zoom on the mountain shapes (should take up entirety of screen)
