### Moon and Sun clock

The clock has the sun and the moon moving in a circle as the hours go by. A full circle is 24 hours. 
The background changes depending on the time of day (At midnight it's black while at dawn it's orange and at noon it's blue).

The position of the sun and the moon represents the time (for example the moon is at the top at midnight and the sun is at the top at noon).

I have changed the code so the stars fade in at night and fade out during the day. Previously, they suddenly appeared/disappeared.
