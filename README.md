## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I've started integrating my ps3 design into the project. The code wasn't as hard to figure out as I thought it'd be which was a relief. 
For this pattern I wanted to follow through on an idea I had for project 3 as a nice graphic wallpaper. I think it'll be fun to create more in depth patterns for this later on.
