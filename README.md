## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today I managed to get my flower working. I think this gives a really interesting look because it isn't too harsh but adds interest to a regular circle. My next step is to again figure out why my mask isn't working correctly for the different colours.

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
