This is a basic abstract shape generator that uses simple rects and lines
to create a detailed pattern. This iteration is much more freeform than previous
iterations, with a focus on abstraction. The color scheme is neon and bright,
taking inspiration from future japanese night lighting. The goal of this wallpaper
is to create an aesthetically pleasing composition using simple shapes to create
a complex pattern. 

You can click on the canvas to generate a new pattern.
