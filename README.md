## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment

FOR PURVIEW: Initial Idea
MAY 13th, 2020:

I currently havent touched this assignment for a while, so when I had more of a thought about what concept to further develop, I ditched the morse code concept and just stuck to a "circle geometric" font. I still wanted to keep the lines and obviously, the circle-- where it is a parameter that never changes. I have coded all of my alphabet and now looking to refining the animation of the interpolation interaction. As much as I wanted to continue with the morse code idea, I had a look on the previous years and had saw that people have already used this idea. So at least my current idea might be a bit too simple, however, I like the "cutesy" feel with the font. I wanted to not focus too much on coding since my timeframe with other assessments have been hectic, but im still proud that I got something up.
