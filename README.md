## Clouds

By referring to the noise example code I tried recreating in the style of my abstract clouds I created in the last project. After making small iterations I am satisfied with this layout so far. There is a lot of variation in cloud sizes and amount of empty spaces that I feel the urge to pan around to explore more.
