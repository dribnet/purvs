Experiment: interpolation, one point at a time.

At first I had just straight mapping from 0-100% on all of my parameters, but in this version I decided to try movinng the points one at a time. This resulted in the animations beinng way too fast. If I were able to slow it down, I might be able to make this look better, but I think the straight mapping looked a lot better. 

In my mind when creating this, I was drawing inspration from very abstrtact works like this inked artwork (https://www.flickr.com/photos/swahiligonzili/8316978053/in/contacts/) and the work of a.creature on Instagram, who uses a lot of wiggly line imagery (https://www.instagram.com/a.creature/). The colour scheme for this version is also inspired by their work

This version however I have gone back to my original earthy colours, so now it is a mixture of worms and engravings. I added a bright 'shadow' to make the letters pop off the background, and changed the colour of the numbers to differentiate them. I got inspiration for the bright shadow from this piece of art (https://i.pinimg.com/474x/80/6d/1d/806d1df6729705cbd3a30881cc8f7ecc.jpg)

The waves through the letters are meant to visually relate to the ridges in worms. They look a bit rigid in the animation but there is not much I can do about that as they use no letter parameters.


Parameters:
  "pointoneX" - first vertex X
  "pointoneY": - first vertex Y
  "pointtwoX": - second vertex X
  "pointtwoY": - second vertex Y
  "pointthreeX": - third vertex X
  "pointthreeY": - third vertex Y
  "letterornumber": - 0 is number and 1 is letter, a true of false type parameter.
