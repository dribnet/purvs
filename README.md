Using the focus and mean values of the focusedRandom function, I have begun to refine some distributions in my sketch. The first facial component I decided to skew the randomness of was the pupil direction. I wanted the faces to predominantly look to the right, so added the focus and mean values accordingly. I then repeated this for the randomness of the mouth 'curvature'. I want the faces to appear mostly disdained or disinterested, so adjusted the values to favour lower mouth corners.
