Sketch of a parametrised hair editor, and parametrised axolotl.

Afro man has controls for the moustache, eyebrows, and afro. There are still many hidden parameters within the image, so trying to think of some way to expose all of them could be fruitful.

The axolotl has controls which help to convey expressive qualities. For this I tried to mimic anthropomorphic animations, such as Finding Nemo, where the animators are able to create expressions on usually expressionless animals (at least to humans.)
