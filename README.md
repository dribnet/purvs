## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Started usning the interpolate feature. I am so confused. since my idea doesnt have number variables, it is going to be tricky to make it move in a nice way. I am thinking of having my wheel rotate and then settling into the letter. Nott sure how nice this will look but i am trying it out. So far I have tried to add a rotate map, It is not really working, I think i will have to play around a bit more.
