PART 2 README

After a lengthy process of trying to understand what direction this project was heading in I finally got face working and my own images uploaded.
The faces are derived from the ones I made in problem set 1 and are quite creepy, almost looking like something an AI would wear if they were trying to be human. This led me to choose faces of world leaders who in science fiction (and sometimes in real life) are often percieved to be evil robots planning mass destruction. I have achieved an uneasy feel from these faces which I'm pleased with.
