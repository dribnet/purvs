In designing my wallpaper and landscape sketches, I wanted a consistent aesthetic and content across both. I decided to use a pond as my subject matter, as there is room for some interesting patterns and variations without straying too far into the realm of abstraction.

In my wallpaper design, I created a grid, then shifted and removed some of the lilypads in order to create some random variation. 

My landscape design draws inspiration from Monet's waterlily paintings. I wanted to evoke a sense of depth and atmosphere, so added perspective and reflections to the original wallpaper design.
