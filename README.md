## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Animation

=======
For the interpolate I merged the code with the part3 with no errors. I put in my variables and tested it but it did not work. I tried again but still not luck when I changed the browsers. The first problem I found was that I put new_letter instead of newObj, however this still did not work. I asked the lecturer and I turned out that I had spelt interpolate wrong. Now with it working I play around the letter forms and found that the ones I rotated it looked really weird. It would fly out of the bounding box and reappear. I'm not sure about this happening but it looks interesting so I may keep it or fix it. I'm not sure how I would go about fixing it though. 

What I will do next with my letter forms is play around with the colours, fills and strokes too see what it looks like, like what I said in my previous commit. I will also play around with the animations to make it more interesting. I think with this method I could fix my rotation effect. I think that it would be interesting to test out some animation effect on it like delaying it. I will play around with it and see what I come up with. 

pos2x this draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y this draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x this draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 this rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 this rotates the inner arc
