## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Attempt at noise

I got some feedback from the tutors on how to make it more interesting and noise was a recommended place to go with the custom pixel to represent smoke. I'm happy with the first image but 2 and 3 are the ones I want to work on I will try and get perlin noise implemented using Dan Shiffmans tutorial on the subject.

Forgot to push and did a bunch of stuff, the particles are now drawing inside my mask which was what I was struggling with the most, got some epic help from Michael and managed to get it working. It's very slow right now due to particle sims though.
