## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Adjusting my skinky. I am really pleased with the results of image 1 and 2. Im just still not keen on my slinky design. I have decided to create a new mask where the whole area of the slinky is crosshatched while the background is paint blotchy. Im not sold on the idea and want to perhaps keep the crosshatched section on the slinky frame and then add the blotched paint effect onto the background area of the slinky. That way you can see the transition of the frame against the background, I think this could be a complementary design decision. Its just deciding if it works or not, once I've completed this I feel that I will be almost ready for hand in. After that it will be going through each image seeing if I can make some notable improvements to the design and refining/tweaking areas that bug me. After looking it the playful colours and the blotchy paint effect, it reminds me of a ballpit from a inflatable park or something. One thing about my theme is that the colours and toys are meant to be playful and exciting, I feel like I have really achieved effect when you see all the images together (even individually).
