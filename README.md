## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

My final exhibit is my typeface named 'Verts and O's' and it is a product inspired by James Edmondson who is a dedicated typographer who creates multiple types of fonts from sans to calligraphy. 
It is a rectangular and elliptical typeface that comes across as a mechanical font, i.e. something drawn by a machine. I designed this typeface to be a retro-style minimalist title piece so I knew it had to match the boldness of Edmondson's.

The font colour is black as it needed to be straight-to-the-point and I feel needed to avoid polychromatic elements.
The background colour though is inspired by the yellow paper from a phonebook

I picked a font that I thought had simple enough parameters for me to input so I ended up with one of his bold and simple fonts inspired by mechanical strokes linked here (https://i.pinimg.com/564x/6f/9f/31/6f9f314d34ec63007fecfcca14980fca.jpg).

My interpretation into code doesn't include the ellipse's ability to change ratio but I improvised by making them vary between a larger size and a smaller one.

Part 1 showcases my method for the ellipses which has been borrowed from the lecturer's assigned code. The colorway was inspired by 'Shadow', which is Nike Brand's grey and black colour palette for their shoes.
I didn't find out how to add more elements wired to the sliders which were available to use in an alternative push of code; but in the end I stuck with what was given and moved onto better iterations.

Part 2 showcases my intended direction mentioned in the part 1 README. With an added rectangular element the typeface takes a step away from abstract and becomes more readable.
After initial struggle, the rect came to life and added more elements into the typeface. Initially I had 2 rects but considering the parameter number restrictions I had to abandon this idea.

Part 3 displays the transitions of each letter. I found that the movements by default were perfect.

Upon arriving to my final, I foud that I had to re-size the letters in half for easier readability. Bold fonts spaced tightly together is too jarring to look at for the viewer so a resize was due.

The parameters are as follows:

	"size": 		Size of 1st ellipse
	"offsetx": 		X pos
	"offsety": 		Y pos
	"size2": 		Size of 2nd ellipse
	"offsetx2":		X pos
	"offsety2": 	Y pos
	"qua_x1_1": 	Quad 1st vertices x pos
	"qua_y1_1": 	Quad 1st vertices y pos
	"qua_x2_1": 	Quad 2nd vertices x pos
	"qua_y2_1": 	Quad 2nd vertices y pos
	"qua_x3_1": 	Quad 3rd vertices x pos
	"qua_y3_1": 	Quad 3rd vertices y pos
	"qua_x4_1": 	Quad 4th vertices x pos
	"qua_y4_1": 	Quad 4th vertices y pos
