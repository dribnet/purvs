### The Simple Clock
For the final clock I have kept the simplistic design of the clock that was inspired by spiral sketch and just cleaned up the code a little. The point of this type of clock was to show a simple way to tell time and I moved from looking at a complex spiral design, developing that into rotations using numbers and eventually changing that into a simple way to tell the time. 

There is also a simple alarm pattern using the click of a mouse which changes from red to blue, which I found is the most noticable colours when flashing. I decided to keep the milliseconds in the final design in the end because I feel like it ads a focal point to the center of the design making it more noticable. Another thing that was added in earlier development was the way to tell the difference between the morning and afternoon cycle, which I made mornings a refreshing blue shade and the afternoons a simple grey colour to display nighttimes and the sun going down.  

Things I like about the design is it is simple and the colours stand out to me. I think that the alarm system is simple like the clock name and makes the clock stand out more when it is going. I think I could have improved on doing more with the design like having more spinning things or something like that, but if I had done that then it would have taken most of the focus of the user off of the clock because its a simple thing to look at. I do like the style of the clock and how easy it is to read and if I had a watch this would be the interface I would want to use because it is simple to read anf easy to understand.
