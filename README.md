## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For the grid I thought it would make sense to try to create computer generated images inspired by work done by Chuck Close. The swirls and abstract nature of his 'mosaic' portraits very much influinced this work.

for this one each circle acts similar to in the first part of the problem set where it gets smaller over time, painting an image. This time around, however, I made it so that the lines are not obstructed which I feel is a better effect, also there are far more circles than the initial moving circles as there is one per grid cell. This is where I learnt that render times will start becomeing something I would have to consider in my designs. I felt it turned out well in the end, the colours are looking great and I feel the viewer can sense there is an image but won't be able to figure out exactly what and I think that's a huge plus.
