(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Ive had an idea for how i wanted to do my alphabet for a while. I want to use 1-3 triangles per letter changing the rotation, shape and fill throughout.

I havent put in enough time yet to understand the code for what we did in class (or to transition it to what i would like it to so) so for now i hav just hard coded my triangles in in the positions i would like them to be.

Im pretty sure its possible with 12 parameters by keeping the starting values of the triangles the same howeverill be able to tell a little more once getting into the groove of things.
