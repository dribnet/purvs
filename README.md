## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Update 2

I selected my images, moving away from portraits and choosing 3 shots which had a similar structure. All 3 presenting narrative through text, 

Firstly I wanted to add some further context, and reasoning to my image selection.


1) A photo of students illustrations explaining themselves on the wall of their since deserted preschool in Te Aro, Wellington 

EDIT: The colours are bright, varied, unrelated, and vibrate highlighting the free, youthful, uneducated nature of children (Red, Orange, Blue, Pink, Green, Purple, and an array of shades). However the main addition is the narrative of what was choosen to be painted, it's self centred. Children not having the knowledge or ability to articulate themselves and their self expression beyond painting their own names, and a number of physical items and brands they like and assosicate with.

2) A photo of a tagged wall, showing a similar form of self expression but this kind illegal and presumably done by a teenager/young adult. 

EDIT: The colours remain vibrant but are singular, more deliberate and restrained (Fluoro Green). In addition the environment gives further context for who executed the work a motorbike being directly next door the the painting. An object synonymous with rebellion, youth, danger as is the medium, still paint, but spray paint. Finally what was choosen to be painted as also grown, it's still self centred but has expanded. The painter turning themselves into a character, given themself a name like a brand, and also using how they wrote this name as the work itself. This showing a development of the self and expansion in technique and narrative. Workplace wall in Mt Victoria, Wellington.

3) A photo of a hand painted, strong typographic sign which has been hung over another hand painted sign. The message here reads 'Teach Peace', and due to this message and strong design I interpreted it as an adult's work. 

EDIT: The colours are now muted, elegant, reserved, classic (Black & White). They highlight the development of character that typically happens in adulthood. They also reiterate a greater development of skill and technique using typography opposed to bright colours (which can be overly showy and distracting) to communicate a message. Finally what was choosen to be painted has grown even further, the painter deciding to communicate the self through a narrative and message that they care about. Rather than focusing on their immidate self. House wall in Kelburn, Wellington.

I edited the code very slightly so the rectangle and circle were smaller.

I solved the error and successfully updating the artwork_2 and artwork_3.
