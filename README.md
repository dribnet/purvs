## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The 'theme' for this progress is a showcase of my friend Cathal, aka Gajuar. I have chosen to use images of him as my theme as I was interested in using images of local musicians (including him), then heard Phoebe say in a lecture that if the theme is personal, it could be something you are proud of. I'm proud of Cathal. As Gajuar, he has released an album, a 2 song collection, just released his 'Waste' EP, is getting gigs booked, and is just an all round incredibly talented dude. I used the horizontal lines because I like how the wind effect in photoshop works, and I really liked the effect the lines had for my work (particularly the first image). I have included text (his personal handwriting of his artist name and the name of his latest ep) in 2 of the images because, like I said, my project is a showcase. When initially discussing this project with Cathal, he was really keen to be on a billboard. So I figured that promoting his latest release would both add to my theme and be a good way to give back to this guy who's put up with being my subject for countless photo shoots.
