## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

I tested it out without the stroke and I'm still not sure whether i like it with or without it. The fuzzy lines and opacity of the triangles make it look interesting and the dangle pieces of the flower remind me of a jellyfish. The background is still drawing over hte flowers so I ask about how to fix it and I will try and get it to work. With the way it looks currently it looks like it is sparkling in a way. The density I think could be more packed together however i do like how it looks with the triangles stretched and spaced out. The image looks like pale washed out crystal lantern flowers which I quite like.
