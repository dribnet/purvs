### Bubble clock

I am thinking of creating a digital clock in which each number is displayed by a coloured circle that interacts with eachother in a chain reaction in a playful manner. This concept is open to change and is not set in stone

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
