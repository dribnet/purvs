## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have experimented with the new software however I do not think I will use this again as it didnt work well with my image for example (found weird stuff like a cell phone or pizza etc) for my design I need to be more precise with my masks. this software does not work to well with what I am doing because I dont have full control of what it picks up and doesnt pick up. since I am using my masks to outline it does not really fit with my theme/concept.  

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
