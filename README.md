## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I liked the effect Phoebe got in one of the lecture videos when she was working with the star for loop and it looked a bit like messy brush strokes so I copied the star function from her github. I changed around the number of lines it drew, the amount they rotated and the stroke size to get a painterly effect. This is what is drawn in the white area of the mask which is the main subject that has red in it. For the black area of the mask I increased the size and amount of the squares so there would be less blank space and I changed the background colour to a greyish blue that I picked from the fan in image 3 which works well for most areas (except the dark spaces) in all the photos.
