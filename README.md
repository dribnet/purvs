## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I've edited my masks to have a grey layer and edited my code to incorporate that. I didn't watch the video on how one is supposed to incorporate another layer and just went for broke so I've got a bug that makes some sections solid red. I'm not totally sure why but I actually think it looks kind of cool. I'd rather things look interesting and be a bit buggy than work perfectly and be boring. I'm feeling a lot better about my compositions now that I have another layer. Theres still a lot for me to explore in the code but I'm feeling pretty good. With the new new grey layer I'm emphasizing some of the shadows.
