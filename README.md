## PS1 MDDN 242 2017


This is my own clock for Project One, and I change some codes in the sublime. After reviewing from the previous sketch drawing. I changed my mind for the design of my own clock, I would rather using waving effects than simple circle expanding. Therefore, I coded a files for background effect 1, a huge amount of ellipses moves with the transformation in width, height, PositionX, PositionY. In the second background effect, I use the codes arc() to create the lightyear's effect. For the clock itself, I want it look more like a digital device for timing. The colour selection, I choose pink and ligthblue and they are exactly a good combination. 

Correction in the next step:
I would try to make the number more like a modern digitalised text. 

And continue fixing some unperfect things in the clocl and background.

Attempt to adjust the lighting of background, make it brighter during daytime and dark at night.
