## Powers of 10 PRINT

I added a third layer whch gets revealed as you zoom in. I made a circle of circles which is drawn under the main shape. This allows colour to be seen underneath the shape and as you zoom in you can see that is a circle of circles. I used red, green and blue as I feel these go well with the sharp contrast of black on white.

I offset a second grid, I believe this creates a more interesting pattern at the top level. In my next commits I will add the third layer of detail.

I have made the grid work for panning and zooming up to 6x (I will make it zoom further in my next commits).

I have experiemneted with stroke weights, this allows for different levels of detail to only become vissable at different zoom levels, as the lines with no longer overlap and cancel each other out. I plan to experiement with offsetting the grid using a noise function as I believe I can achieve a night sky look in the further out zoomed levels if I invert the colour scheme.

My idea takes my wallpaper from ps3 and uses it to create a paramatised map. I chose to use my wallpaer as it is created completely from straght lines. The use of straight lines overlaping each other at an angle tricks the eye into thinking it is a curved edge it is looking at. By being able to zoom in on the shape I hope the viewer wil be able to see the compostion of the shape better and notice that it indeed is a made up of staright lines. I may experiement with a more zoomed out scene, or try to create a pixelated background which when zoomed in apon reveals another layer to the puzzle.
