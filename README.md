## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I am working with is 'Clutter.' I have taken photos of various messy areas around my house that have been left there. I have used irregular rectangles to increase the overall chaos of the image. Uncluttered areas are coloured darker to highlight the areas of clutter. Areas of clutter are covered in a thin scribble effect, which appears more natural compared with the hard edges of the background elements.
