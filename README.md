## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I have added ambient animation that stretches and shrinks each orange pattern to create a random looking wiggling motion. I think it's a nice call-back to my ps3 animation, as it captures aspects of the original pattern's motion but is much more simplified to work with this problem set's base code. I like how it makes different areas of my pattern look subtly different across the page. I only wish it ran a bit faster.

The progression as follows:

0. Original pattern
1. Dark diamond added
2. Diamond is lightened, inner lines of main pattern is added.
3. Diamond is lightened again
4. Second pattern is added
5. Ellipses are added faintly
6. Orange outer line appears, ellipses get darker, fill enabled.
7. Ellipses appear the same colour as the original background, orange outer lines get thicker

I think I'm going to have to give up on the idea of taking the zoom levels any deeper, as it's obviously going to be too much to draw another layer of pattern even smaller. I'm pretty happy with where it's at even if I can't quite get things polished off how I wanted.
