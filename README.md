## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Sketch background

The background has been replaced with a sketchy pattern, deliberately full of white gaps to make it look unfinished, as it is considered by the owner of the object to be unimportant. May need to tweak it to be more visually understandable.

Next step is to modify the object of interest to make more like it's been painted, rather than being made of what are obviously ellipses.
