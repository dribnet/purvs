This README explains the final composition
For my final composition I decided to bring everything together, to achieve a cohesive contrast. I used the techniques I learned earlier, from patterns to colours, to create something where I pulled out all the proverbial stops. 
I want to escelate the creepiness, by placing the disturbing dolls in a clinical, bright, opulant environment. I increased the number of creepy dolls again, and reintroduced the  cartoon faces in the roll of portraits on a wall. . 
My oridinal intention was to create drastically  different drawing styles, and to challenge myself in terms of coding AND design.. I think I have well and truly achieved this. The process is documebted in the ReadMes of each submission.
