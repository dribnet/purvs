## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Looking at my pictures I was trying to come up with a theme and as my pictures seem to show the sea and the sky it made me think of pollution and how we need to protect our seas and oceans more and decided to try convey that message/theme in my symbols. I found a stop looking symbol is often used to stop littering and it might convey that message in my pictures. 
I'm also just adjusting the sizes of my symbols to see what looks the best.
