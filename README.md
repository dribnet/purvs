I have updated the face code with my Toast code.

I am still working on correcting the eyebrows as they do not always fit across the whole piece of toast. There is also an issue with the shape of the toast not including the forehead too as this often looks odd.

I am happy with how the eyes and mouth are working though and will just keep working with the values to get the correct sizing.

I would also like to include a lot more sliders to change the colours and sizes of each component.
