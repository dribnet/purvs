## Adding detail

Today I redrew the leaf and stick in functions using beginShape with bezier and curve vertexes. I also adjusted the colour of the stick to fit with the green better, but I might still change around the colours another time. Now that I am happy with the shapes, I can start to work on creating the rest of the letters.
