## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
After watching another pheobe tutorial I really liked the paint blotchy effect she did with the draw star. I thought I would give this a try with my rubiks cube and my legos and apply it to my mask. I really liked the results as I want my final images to be abstracted. The painting idea supports that statement and is something I want to use in my final. I especially like it against the high density of the crosshatched background. The two styles work well together, mainly for the legos as they are all piled together. What I like about the blotchy paint effect is that It clearly singles out one of the legos within the pile. That was my overall intent with this image - to try and isolate one of the cubes amoungst the others.
