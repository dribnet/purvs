### Solar System Clock

Solar system clock version 2

today i changed my code to draw each planet and the sun in the correct order depending on where 
on their orbits they are and cleaned up the code that was drawing the sun. I also changed some of the look by adding a glow to the sun and making 
the inner orbit go around the sun.
