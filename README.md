## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

26/05/20 - Experimentation 1
The images above are photos of flowers taken in garden processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html).

You can see I have done some experimenting throughout my images. 
Image 1: I decided to reverse the sizing on the masked and non masked area. So I made the rectangles in the nonmasked area size 30 and the maked circles size 5. I just love the complimentary colours and contrast this image is producing and it is cool you can still see that it is a flower.

Image 2: I kept this one simple and masked the centre of the flower so it creates a 3D look.

Image 3: I was most experimental with my last image making negative space. In photoshop I used a flower shape template and increased the white stroke. I then placed it ontop of the flower in my image and now it looks like there's two flowers. I also drew some lines to the left and right to make more negative space - now it looks like there's movement in the image due to the horizontal lines. For this image I made the unmasked area the cirlce and the masked area the rect.
