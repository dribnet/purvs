### Butterfly Clock

I slightly altered my design so that the butterflies are flying within a ring shape rather than a circle so that it makes more sense for the butterflies to not be using the centre of the circle. For the alarm, I thought I would fill in the inner circle black when the alarm is set and it will fade to white and decrease in size during the final 10 seconds of the alarm. When the alarm goes off, I trialed the idea of having the colours on the screen invert. The butteflies inverting by themselves didn't seem to be a strong enough of an impact, but when I added the inverting of the background I felt like it ruined the look of the design a bit since the rectangular edges were visible.
