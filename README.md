## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

## Final

For this project I wanted to adapt my idea from PS3 and explore how else it could be animated and displayed. I feel that this design has turned out pretty well. I wasn't able to execute my original idea but I feel that I was still able to make something visually stimulating. 
The colours are based off previous experiments in project 3 which I thought looked pretty nice, so I wanted to try and implement all of them here. Originally I wanted to include the pulsing and growing arcs from PS3 however I wasn't able to get the array working properly. I was a bit disappointed as I feel that if it had the same 'painted' look it could've been even better.
For the animation I wanted to have something organic and interesting to look at. I feel the growing and shrinking arcs at different speeds captures this pretty well. Offsetting each sinewave made for something a lot cooler and added a nice level of faux randomness to it.

I didn't experiment as much with this project as I did with others which I regret, because I feel like I could've got some pretty neat results with this. But overall though I'm pretty happy with how this turned out.
