### John Maeda Clock #7

This is my take on the swivel clock. This was a technically difficult task for me as I have not coded for the past 2 years but with the guidance of Tom and my peers I managed to produce an animated clock. I will iterate this into a better aesthetic, though not necessarily animated.
