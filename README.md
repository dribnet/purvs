### Coconut Clock

My idea is to have a coconut tree as my clock. There could be two where the smaller tree trunk will act as the second keeper and the taller tree trunk will act as the minute keeper. So as time goes by, the trunk of the tree will get darker until it reaches the 60 minute mark it will be at the top and a coconut will fall. It could perhaps fall and crack open with the number for the hour of time it is and then whether its AM or PM on the halves of the coconut. This is just an initial idea.
