### Clock Ideas

Joey Zasa

Some clock concepts I have thought of and sketched out, unsure what idea I want to pursue but want to do more research before deciding.

[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
