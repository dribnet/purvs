## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The Ocean Bloom

Final Update: The pixels under the label of "star" were thinned out a bit

---------------------------------------------------------

The idea for my pixel was, what I call, the Ocean's Bloom.

Essentially the idea was to represent the contrasting elements between the sea and land. This is because I feel that it was easy to make contrasting pixel elements between the two as they are very different from each other but they also coexist with each other.

The pixel names are as given and are identified as:
- "Star" = The four point star
- "Flake" = The 8 point star
- "Flare" = The Parallelogram that represents water
- "Blade" = The three point star

These names aren't exactly the best to represent what they actually are. I just gave them names that suit what their shape essentially was...bar Flare which was a last minute decision.

The idea is that the stars lose or gain extra points as they cross between the two worlds. This is mainly evident in the first and third image when the contrast is noticable. For the second image, the case is a bit different as the 8 point star is reflective of the barrier between the two worlds and the three point star represents the peak of the side of the land.

Overall, I aimed for a more oil/water-colour painting style in my imagery. I felt that this style would suit my idea the best the concept of oil/water-colour painting focuses more on blending colours and making contrasting colour shades harmonise with each other.

"That will be all for today. I hope that you have all learned something today. Perhaps one day we might find a way to end this conflict between us Tidesages and Druids. I must return to the Warriors of Leviathan now. Thank you Koroud for letting me share my thoughts and share my knowledge and I hope to work with you all again in the future."
