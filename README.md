## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

in this update i was playling around with my original code (the lines and rectangles) and had the idea to make them really small and so it would look almost like grain or a glitch. initially i tried it with white (which did look cool), but then i changed to just the colour of the photos and omg!! i think it looks really good!! i really like it! it gives it an extra element and also uses randomness, which i wasn't using before with just the pixels.
