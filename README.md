## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process 3:

I have finished all my three pictures today. For my last picture, I took it when I was in the night market. There were four people in the band, playing different instruments on the stage. In this picture, I have masked it with 7 gradients. For those people who playing instruments, I have used rectangles with fill and lines for my pixels. From left, I have filled rectangles for first and third person. The different between them is the first person has filled with vertical rectangles while the second person has filled with horizontal rectangles. For second and fourth pereson, it's the same idea but using lines instead of rectangles. For the lantern and the stage, I have filled them with slash lines, but both of them have different direction slash lines. Lastly, I wanna make the background looks lighter since the main point in this picture is the band. My first idea was to filled them with lines. However, after I experiment it, the background filled with lines was too dark and hardly to focus on the band. Therefore, I decided to use ellipses for my background. This makes the audience focus on the band instead of the background.
