  First tutorial for PS2. Getting used to using github desktop and changing files. Made a simple design using arcs as a basis for my design. Also uploaded a variety of different sketch ideas.

  My idea is inspired by bauhaus typography. I looked at the shapes used which include arcs, triangles, and squares. Each letter is made up of 2 arc's, each arc can be altered by position, size and degrees for the amount of rotation of them. So far i have 8 parameters. I could try make the first yellow arc at a fixed position in order to get less parameters. At some point I will try and change the 2nd arc into a triangle. I updated my draw_letters.js and letters.js from sketch.js
