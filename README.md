I didn't think the smart mask process would work with the masks I wanted so I hadn't used it previously after testing it. Using them now, I was right. I found that the clipping on the person was very rough and imprsise, and had squared off bits at the tops and bottoms. On mask number three it said it picked up cell phones, but when I asked it to make a mask with the cell phones it came up with a blank mask. I also cannot isolate faces from the bodies, as this is the premise of the theme, I will not be using the smart mask tool as I have a lot more control in photoshop to create my own custom masks.
