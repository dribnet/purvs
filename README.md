This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

Each of my faces reacts to the 3 sliders in the top left corner of the page. For the first face I recreated a minimalist version of Harry Potter. I wanted the face to be recognisable just by the key features of the character. The colour and location of his scar can be altered along with the size of his glasses.

In the next face I wanted to try something completely different. I wanted this to look "sketchy" and give the user the ability to turn off and on certain aspects so different combinations would show different expressions. The eyes and face lines can be changed (through the use of discrete variables) along with how bold the lines are. 

I wanted the final face to look more cartoonish than the other so opted for bold features and added lines. The colour of the eyes and face can be changed as well as the length of his antenna.
