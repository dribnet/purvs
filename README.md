## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2
Final Design

For my initial process, I was aiming at creating a more abstract font using shapes and arcs that I hard use as I have been to scared too. I liked the look the triangles gave and the possibility of only using 2 shapes to convey my alphabet. I really wanted to give this a go because I could always add more if I didn't like it. I then found my design looked really similar to others and needed to give it a quirk. I considered my own personal handwriting as letter eligibility is difficult with my dyslexia. I could use this in my abstract alphabet by playing around with the scale, the position of the letter and if they were pointing in different directions as to what they would have been. I have also reflected this in calling my font Dystypes.

I also like in my design how I have used the opacity to its full advantage. I initially had it used on pink and purple which created a muddy colour when opacity is used. So using the colour wheel, and using solid primary colours that could create a strong secondary colour. I think this enhanced my design because the colour mix doesn't look off and using the third primary colour as my background allows the 3 other colours to stand out. As part of this as well in my interaction animation, I have made the opacity snap at the end to give more interest as some letters might have little to no adjustments in opacity, It will still snap.

Overall I am very happy with my outcome. I think I have been able to use my own handwriting flare and transfer this into my code. I prefer the design of my final to my design before adding scale, position and different directions as it has given my design a unique personal flare. I have also shown this through the selcted words in my exibition displaying every single letter of my alphabet.

The parameters per letter:

  * `redoffsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `redoffset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `redoffset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `redoffset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one

  *	`opacity` : Colour opacity

  * `yellowoffsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `yellowoffsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `yellowoffset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `yellowoffset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `yellowoffset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `yellowoffset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one
