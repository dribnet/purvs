## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

6 - 12 / 4 / 22:

I'm updating the "sketch.js", "draw_letter.js", "editor.js", and "letters.js". This is my recent result from 6 - 12th April 3/5 hours daily. 

I have completed my alphabet and numbers with considration of feedback design. I've chaned my prameters with adding a fix shapes and some flaxible shapes. 

I have plan to change the colours of the background and the the letters in next step and edit some letters as I'm still think about those.

Now my recent parameters are:

let cntrWidth = letterData["cntr_w"];
  let cntrHeight = letterData["cntr_h"];
  let handle_width = letterData["handle_w"];
  let handle_height = letterData["handle_h"];
  let cutterWidth = letterData["cutter_w"];
  let cutterHeight = letterData["cutter_h"];
  let ellMain_y = letterData["main_ypos"];
  let ell1_x = ell_x + letterData["cntr_xpos"];
  let ell1_y = ell_y + letterData["cntr_ypos"];
  let ell2_x = ell_x + letterData["handl_xpos"];
  let ell2_y = ell_y + letterData["handl_ypos"];
  let ell3_x = ell_x + letterData["eyes_xpos"];
  let ell3_y = ell_y + letterData["eyes_ypos"];
  let ell4_x = ell_x + letterData["cutter_xpos"];
  let ell4_y = ell_y + letterData["cutter_ypos"];


I'm still think about the letters and their edit. so might be change the parameters again.
