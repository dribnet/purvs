### Tree clock

I have been working on my alarm to make it more interesting. I thought it would be cool if there is an ellipse that grows from the centre of the screen in the lead up to the alarm and then once it reaches the edges the background changes colour as the alarm goes off. In the debug setting if you select debug and alarm then change minutes and hours lines are created at each minute/hour which looks really cool, I'm just not too sure how to implement this into my design when the alarm isnt going off.
I am having trouble with Git in that I am trying to edit the old versions of the files but its not working.
