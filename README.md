## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've just been practicing making a new pixel and I think I get how that's all working. I should be in pretty good shape to design a pixel and I get how to add new photos and masks so I feel confident on all that. Now what I really need is my theme and final pictures. I'm not much of a photographer so that's probably the part I'm most worried about. It's hard thinking about a theme with everything going on in the world right now especially back home in the united states. That all just feels scary and disheartening and I don't think I could do it justice. Especially stuck here. I have been thinking about my room a lot lately as I've been feeling a bit trapped in it. I was thinking about how I've been trying to make this physical space a reflection of myself when I'm in here all the time. I'm still not sure what my final pixel is going to be but I'll probably mostly figure that out by fooling around.
