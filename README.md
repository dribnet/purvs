## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this commit i wanted to focus on my masks and images as i am quite happy with my code looks.

After working out that my code works better with a strong colour scheme i decided i wanted to try some stuff that in mind and manipulate my own images to be a little more vibrant, I decided to crop out the main focus of my image and copy it and invert the colour and then have a gradiwnt back ground,image 1. I didnt like the way this ended up looking and am leaning towards just making unique masks for my images as oi am happy with the two in this commit, images 2/3.

From here i want to keep image 2/3 and experiment a little more with another image and see what i can come up with.
