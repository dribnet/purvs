I've combined my second two faces into one, and have been focussing on the eyes and eyebrows to add variation to the expression. 

I still need to add some more aesthetic variances so that when it's in the random grid, there is enough interest and variation in each face to keep the viewer engages. 

As far as adding the remaining facial features, hair, etc goes, I'm thinking I'll draw an assortment of them in photoshop and allow the program to select a feature at random from the array.
