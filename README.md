## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

## Episode 3.5 MASK 

You know i had to do it to em (CONTEXT)

testing the masking-tool in would have been really usefully since it saves the time to create mask for my images, but since a large majority of my images didnt have some of the preset values that were identified by the smartmask i couldnt use it that much

-take photos :D done!!
-make theme :D done 11
-experiment further with the codeâ€¦ more to go
