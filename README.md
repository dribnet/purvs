## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After looking at the last experiement, the images kind of reminded me of Vincent Van Gogh's painting. Hence I have decided to create "brush strokes" and creating a impressionism-like image.

The idea to do show 2 places that I currently call home. The image on the left is shot at the waterfront in Wellington, New Zealand. The image on the right is shot at a decommissioned cross-country train track in Singapore. The image is the flags of the two nations.
