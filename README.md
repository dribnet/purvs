## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

Sketch updated with a design potential and also changed preview and thumbnail to match. Design idea is solar system. planet moves between 12 to 11 and then centre to make 9 moves. Sun colour indicated wheath number or letter or blank. Black is white sun with black planet in the center.
