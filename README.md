## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Updated Default Letter. The interaction has been made, because my shapes are just a rectangle and two ellipses, the interaction worked really well withthe default mapping and still looks really effective. I really do like how the interaction turned out. Next I have to create my exhibition part of this code, then after maybe a few more tweaks it'll be near on ready for submission. I have also changed the background colour to match that of my letter base squares.

Currently I am sitting on a nice 10 parameters:
sizex
sizey
offsetx
offsety
cirsize1
cirsize2
ciroffsetx
ciroffsety
cir2offsetx
cir2offsety
