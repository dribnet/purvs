I am still trying to get my code towards something I'm happy with. It is low on detail and not quite what I'm after, but I do like how it builds as mouse is pressed.


I am trying to work towards making my pattern like a spider web, with lots of detail going on but also connections that continue when it is tiled. This is still progressing, and I hope to use this pattern to make a mountain landscape in some way.
