## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After watching the tutorials in the lecture I played around with creating tiles. I quite liked the randomness of the ellipses making up the figure so I thought maybe I could try putting the background on a tile loop istead to create the lines I was wanting. I did this using two different for loops which is a bit messy at the moment so I will work on cleaning the code up after I've gotten the desired effect. I do like the direction this is heading but it's not quite there yet.
