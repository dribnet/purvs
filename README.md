## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos from a trip to Japan I went on in 2015. They all share similar colours and moods so I thought they would be good subjects for this project.

I am experimenting with using lines to represent my pixels. The detailed part uses sharp caps, while the background is rounded. I added a variable that can take advantage of gradients. I will be sure to tinker with the gradients to produce some cool effects.
