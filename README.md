## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 12 parameters.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

I have completed the parameters for my alphabet so am now looking into different styles and what style will be used for my final alphabet.

 - Style One
 	- Solid Colour

 	This style aims to play off the layered aspects of my design, with the blendMode being set to multiply, any overlays colour is effected, thus changing the overall form of the letter slightly.

 	The two selected colours are red and blue as I like the contrast between each layer.
