### Flaming Display Concept

--------------------------------------------------

My current rough concept is simply a traditional 7-segment display clock, but the segments are emitting
flaming particles. This would provide opportunity for a lot of nice secondary motion and physical effects.

I don't think this is as strong as it could be, so I might scrap this and try for something more ambitious.
