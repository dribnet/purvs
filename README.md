## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I am currently taking Typography, where I've been researching how geometric shapes make up letter forms and today I felt inspired to create my letter forms from geometric shapes in p5.js, I want them be abstract like but still resemble the letter.

Over mid tri break:
Since taking a break from uni for a week, I've come back to work on my project with a clear mind and new outlook on the brief. I felt like before the break I had a creative block and was unsure where I was going with everything. Today I have just finished my letters and numbers. Obviously I will be refining and developing them further over time before the project is due. I completed everything with just outlines, now Ill be experimenting with black and white through negative space and contrast. For now I want to keep things simple and potentially add detail towards the end when I'm feeling more confident.
