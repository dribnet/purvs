My final iteration of my wallpaper. I have decided to go with this layout which gives the design a nice symmetry which ties together the varied symbols nicely. The colour pallet was chosen to produce a calm scene with the dark colour of the symbols forming the primary focus. The symbols have a nice balance with the background, without being lost.
