Final Project 2

For this project I decided to use lines. I got the idea from greek lettering and wanted to do that as my theme. I did not exactly copy the greek font, I have changed many of the letters to make it more of my own style. Some letters as you can see don't touch. The colour for this palette is pastel purple because i wanted it to stand out. Purple can sometimes mean power so that is why I used it to make my alphabet stand out. 

I initially wanted to do squares, using squares to make the alphabet but it was a bit difficult as some letters looked the same when it comes to squares, all you can do is shift and tilt. I moved on the rectangles but it was a bit too big for the 100 x 200 size box. Then when I made it smaller it turned into a line so i just decided to use the lines instead.

The parameters per letter:

I defined my parameters by the first letter of the shape and with the value.

linex1 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney1 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex2 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney2 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex3 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney3 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex4 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney4 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex5 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney5 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex6 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney6 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex7 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney7 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex8: x position for the beggining of the line

liney8 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex9 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney9 : y position for the beggining of the line

linex10 : x position for the beggining of the line

liney10 : y position for the beggining of the line
