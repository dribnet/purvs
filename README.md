## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I have started with my basic design i have started with creating my A B C and went with a runic alphabet theme

I have completed and made what i want my full alphabet to look like and now implimenting it from sketch.js to draw_lettters.js and letters.js. I am running into a few problems as i did intianally hard code the alphabet and had to change it up a bit so that all the letters would be under the 12 varible mark that is set for this assignment. 

I have completed implementing my whole alphabet into the letters.js and draw_letters.js. I just need to do a few tweaks to the design and I should have my project completed.

I have changed up my alphabet a bit like the C so it fits in more with the runic theme. I also added in the animation of the alphabet, its a bit janky, but I actually like it this way its like the lines get all jumbled up and then morphs into the letters.
