After experimenting with the code a lot I was able to figure out how to use quadratic vertices to draw the solid wave shape. After I drew these in the right places on the grid I then drew the circles for each wave. However, this took a lot longer than I thought it would because I had to place each circle individually.

Moving forward my next step is to work on the zoom. I want to use this to show more complexity, so as you zoom in it starts off as a solid wave and ends as waves made of circles.
