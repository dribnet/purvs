I intend to do a cloud pattern that random clouds surround a circle, and in that circle there are colorful and different clouds.

For this pattern, I use a single cloud element to make a random cloud group, and in the middle I use another cloud pattern to make a colorful and dynamic group. Technically, I use blendMode to add colors for white stroke, use lerpColor to make a color transition for the middle clouds and I use noise to move the clouds.
