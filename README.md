I have changed the Chinese mask code to face map, the skin colors and eyebrows colors are random.
I still use bezier vertex to construct the curves, but the anchor point uses face data.

add slider to control eyebrows, eyerims, skin color and eyebrow color.

add tatto, middle triangle and slider control for beard
