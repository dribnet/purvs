## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

09/06/20 - White Version (Experiment)

While I was coding my final for this project I was interested to see what my pixel images would look like if they were inverted to white as they all have very dark backgrounds. 

These were the results. They were very bright to look at because I was used to my dark images but I was aa big fan of the first image because it looked like a Wallpaper with some sort of pattern. My images contrasted equally as good on a black or white background so I will take this into consideration when I am handing in my final.
