Still getting used to the way the code works and how to get my wallpaper idea working with this code set. So far i have multiple circles that line on the diagonal, they over lap and as you zoom in have some animation. Next I am going to play around with the different zoom states and see if i can make something interesting.


Got these cool pulsating flower looking things.
