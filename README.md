## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I don't have set theme in mind yet with my images but my three images I selected are scenery images that I took down south and I tried to get a variety of images from the some place but in different settings. So I have a water setting, a mountain setting and a nature and tree setting. So I played around with the sizes of the dots and squares to see if will show the fine details of the images like the mountain.
