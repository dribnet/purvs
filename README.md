## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Object focus test.

Change of change of plans: Now looking at how seemingly random objects can be the most important things to their owners. I took some pictures of my stuff around the house to use for this. I want to render whatever the object it in high detail, with everything else blurred out and out of focus. I've only messed with one image thus far, and I need to make the difference more significant, maybe add some sort of outline. I really want to play more with how the important object is rendered - I want it to be displayed in a more artful way, showing it how the owner sees it.
