## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

10/05/20
Missed all of last weeks classes. Im catching up on what i've missed on.
Downloaded the files from Git, Played around with making A B and C 

Added some characters and changed the colours to a yellow and black. That was a mistake, now I just have beady eyes staring back at me. 

Added the rest of the alphabet. Still to look at animating the transitions and polishing afterwards. 
Changed the colours of the stroke and orange block to directly opposite to each other on the colour wheel
Still need to see what colour to make the background

Changed the variables that allowed my characters to animate the transition between them. 
Im very happy with the results. I also experimented with the colours, changing them into a pink / purple
monochome theme. The round edges and colours remind me of candy, I think ill likely name my type after
some sort of candy. 

Added a default character.

I corrected and updated my sketch, and also did some general tidying up of code / adding comments.
