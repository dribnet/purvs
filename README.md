## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I am designing a 'font' to be used in a graphic design way, it is made from triangles and is not 100% totally readable as the mainstream and typical forms of the letter. I do not want the letters to be instantly recognisable but I do want them to have some resemblance and readability that they could be used in abstract graphic design. I want my letters to made from the most minimal amount of parameters possible. Doing this through triangles might be a little bit difficult. I might experiment with arcs rather than triangles. I wanted to use a limited colour scheme. I have set myself the challenge of trying to be good at using triangles since I have not really used them in my other designs in creative coding.
