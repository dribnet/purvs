PART 3

I have made a more dynamic cloud layer which revels more and more sections of the underlying land as you zoom. At this point I think this first section of graphical zoom is complete and I will start adding features within the land map layers. 

I stuck with a simplistic grided system kept within a nested loop to create my cloud layers. It runs fairly slow at the moment and I'm unsure how to fix this at this stage.
