## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've updated the second and third images. I really like the horizontal stripes on Cathals shirt, so I'm keen to emphasize that visual aspect of the photo with my p5js drawing. I also really like the way that the white wall on the left makes a good spot to add text. I definitely need to keep trying out different drawing ideas for this image, I'm not happy with where its at at the moment. One idea I have is to create more of a contrast between his hand and the rest of the image, to make it look like the hand is floating/completely separate. For the third image, I want to play with the strong contrast and spotlighting present, and maybe experiment with some larger, blockier drawing styles (maybe getting some inspiration from jason anderson https://www.jasonandersonartist.co.uk/ ). I feel that these images are a good representation of my theme. They portray local artists in very unique and eyegrabbing way, which is ideal when you want to be advertising these artists. It seems that adding text of the artists name as branding is allowed, so when I add that it will make my theme more obvious.
Still having issues with the non-ending rendering, I've posted in the slack so hopefully I can get some help with that soon.
