STARTING MY ALPHABET & SETTING UP EDITOR

Before creating the rest of my letters for my alphabet I wanted to get the editor set up and running so that I could easily experiment with forming my letters. I managed to get it working to how I wanted and started to adjust my letters. I have changed the opacity of my letters to see if I can get some cool designs, I might have to experiment with different colours and the opacity of the shapes overall but so far I'm liking it. I will decide and play around with the this again once all my letterforms are completed. 

I have used 14 parameters which consist of one rectangle and two arcs. I'm still sticking with this style of my letter to be clean and minimal, designs that give off enough shape to recognise the letter. 

The fourteen parameters per letter:
  * `rectX` : x location of the rectangle
  * `rectY` : y location of the rectangle
  * `rectW` : width of the rectangle
  * `rectH` : height of the rectangle
  * `arcW` : width of the arc
  * `arcH` : height of the arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the first arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the first arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the first arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the first arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the second arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the second arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the second arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the second arc
