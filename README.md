## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

This is my exhibition. The font itself is named "ShipsEye". This is to reflect the fact that it is inspired by the Semaphore flag signalling system as well as the Braille language. the sample words are:

  "SHIPSEYE",
  'MARITIME'
  "FLAGSHIP",
  "SIGNALS!",
  "MDDN 242"  

 I am happy with how the characters and numebrs look beside each other when the are out fo sequential order, and I am happy with how they transition from one letter/number to the next.
