## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images are from two different photography projects but both include floral images, I decided to use because I know they were high quality and some of my favourite images and my favourite subject to photography. The first one is from a project based on the process of relationships. The other two are from a project that I did that had flowers as symbols of the 7 stages of grief. 
I experimented a little bit with the mask and the different sizes and background colour to familarise myself with the code.
