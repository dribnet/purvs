## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

(Renders take around 20-25 seconds on my laptop)


For the focus of my project, I chose to use some pictures I had of my cats from a fun photoshoot I did a couple of years back. I chose this theme because I don't get to seem them often and I think it would brighten some peoples day to see a couple of cute cats on a billboard in the city. As far as the theme itself goes, I wanted to use the custom pixel to emphasize how fluffy and soft they are, and showcase just the general beauty of my cats. The photos also have good lighting
and framing, so they work well for this purpose.

In my design process, I started by focusing on how use shapes to enhance the natural shapes present in the images. The main two sections of my mask: the black or white, I feel create quite a striking image.
The white part, which I have centered on the cats across the images, is a large collection of randomly sized and angled strokes, which I feel really emphasizes the fur of the cats and creates a chaotic feel. This mask is also used on the upper plant matter in the third image, where I feel it is also impactful, as it channels the untamed, natural feel of that area.
The black part of the mask, which I have used as the primary 'background' feature, is a collection of randomly placed, larger ellipses. The effect it creates feels very abstract painterly, like an old beautiful painting. I feel this effect, again, has the most striking effect in the third image, where the colours of the water in the background create a really striking effect to back up the foreground.
I also included two grey shade masks, both used for more subtle effects.
With the darker grey mask, my original intent was to better highlight the eyes of the cat in the second picture, so I chose to use some densely packed ellipses in a smaller size, in hopes to showcase the colours present. I implemented this mask in different ways in the other images, but it's the most prevalent in the second image.
With the lighter grey, I render those parts in the form of a pixel-esque style, to get a more focused but still stylized look.

Overall, I'm really happy with how the custom pixel portrays my images, I think they're very beautiful. Through working on this project, I've learnt a lot about representing things through code, and how to write code to showcase beautiful things in a new light.
