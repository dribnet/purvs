## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - Adoration

After a lot of thought I have decided that the theme of my project will be Adoration. The focus of my three images are my dog, Abu. The purpose of images in terms of being displayed would be to remind people of the things that matter most to them, whether that be a loved one or family pet.

For the background (Black mask) I decided to go for a red background that symbolises love with a triangular pattern over the top with diagonal lines striking through them.

The middle image that I currently have will not be used as I have a better image.
