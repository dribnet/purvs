I've got the detail I wanted on the snowflakes that I think look good when zooming in. Because I have made it such a small circle at the beginning then going into a snowflake the zooming is a lot slower than I wanted it but I don't think there is much I can do about that.
I would love to play around with colour add more detail to the snowflake. 

Overall it is at a good point now where I am able to play around and adjust sizes to see what works best for this problem set.
