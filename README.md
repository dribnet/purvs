## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
For this experiment I wanted to make the background more interesting. I added an extra ellipse to the background and shifted it up by 1.5. This makes a pattern which I like more than the single rows of ellipses.

I also made the transparent hexagons white so they would match the background. I don't like this as much as the semitransparent hexagons because the flowers don't stand out as much as they did.

I tried using the smartmask on another image of a flower but it didn't work well. It did I creates a large area around the flowers instead of masking the actual flowers even though the background was white. This isn't helpful to me so I don't think I'll be using it.
