## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel







【May.27.2020】
These are some pictures of a toy room in a historic house that I recently visited.

Image 1 :
Simple try.
This picture is a doll beside a tea table.
Basically no code has been changed. I just changed some of the values.
For the mask part, I chose the eyes of the doll and the background. Trying to create a weird, scary effect.

Image 2 :
Text "Royal Carriage"
Make the mask by changing the text to white.
In order to show the text clearly, I used thin and short lines.

Image 3 :
I changed the maximum value of "i" to get a more detailed picture.
For the mask part, I used black, white and gray to divide the picture into three effects.
 Squares to represent the wooden train, giving a feeling of building blocks. The thin horizontal lines represent the area around the train, showing a carpet texture(This way the input picture and output picture will present different feelings magically). The background is filled with ellipses.
