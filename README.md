Part 1: Initial Ideas - Rough sketch ideas

So far I have sketched up my albhabet using lines. I want to use the style of using lines to make up the letters for my final alphabet. I'm planning to experiment with the use of lines, rectangles or possibly vertex. It'll help me decide which one is better to use as I don't want to reach the max limit of the number of parameters that can be used. 

I plan to use transparency because it could add more interesting results. I could use the colours of the rainbow as my colour palette because I think that could look very beautiful with the use of transparency. Im also going to play around with stroke widths and using different transparency levels with it, which could add more unexpected results that could work well.
