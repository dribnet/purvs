Artist Statement:

When I initially started thinking about a parametric alphabet with a list pf constraints i found myself taking interest in a 1927 bauhaus poster. It was this poster that i then deconstructed in to its individual geometric forms. It then provided me with shape assets that I could then manipulate to create letter forms.

The style of the font is influenced by the heavy negative space to match the style of the bauhaus poster. The colour palette is also a 4 tone pallete with 1 maroon 1 orange and 2 grey / black tones. A slight development from the 3 tone inspiration poster

One thing i wish i had done differently would be to spend more time setting up rules around the how the letters look visually so there is more cohesion across the alphabet. I had tried to
Implement more rules as i went through the design process but i found that having a maximum number of parameters was to limiting to implement this.
