## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

To help bring my whole animation together, I decided to tie back in the first zoomed out pattern into zoom level 4 and above. It does make it a bit more laggy, but I think it makes the image look a lot better. I don't think I'll add a lot more detail after this, maybe just subtle colour changes for a few extra zooms, but I think it looks quite effective as it is (the current colours are a work in progress at the moment too). I also want to try fix the animation that is randomised so that it doesn't get faster and faster - a minor detail though. I have got the main part of the map now so it is just further iterations and fixing details from here.
