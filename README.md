## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I have chosen is one that is personal to me. I have chosen to showcase an area where I essentially grew up in the Far North called Tauranga Bay. The photos I have chosen were taken by me over Queen's Birthday Weekend. Photo one is a spectacular sunset taken from the rocks to Butterfly Bay. Photo two is the waves over the same rocks with the sunset colours reflected in the sea.

In terms of the pixel appearance I have decided that because all of my photos feature the sea and some element of land I'm going to have a simple rect with a symbol that is representative of either the sea(wave symbol), sky(wind symbol), and the land(tree symbol). I am going to differentiate these using the masks, with the sea being black on the mask, the sky a specific gray, and the land being white. As I was working on this while we were at Tauranga Bay and thus I didn't have internet, some tweaking will definitely need to be made in terms of the size and appearance of the square pixels. The sky will have a cloud symbol.
