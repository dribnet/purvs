## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have tried to create a custom pixel that has a touch of floral elements while arranging the pixel in a grid formation so it remains structured. I have chosen to create masks that highlight the floral subject of the pictures. 		

I have inverted my masks so that the background are more detailed than the flowers. I think this makes the flowers more of a focal point because you can see more of the colours. This is except for the frame photo as it is a bit far away. I might change the frame photo back to the plain background and keep the others how they are. I also edited the mask of the photo being held with two hands so that the hands are the same rectangular pixel as the background. I think this small change helped to keep the flowers as the centerpiece.
