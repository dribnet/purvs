### Updated clock with ellipses and current time

I have improved the day/night cycles to include a mapped sun and moon go across the screen. I have also made the clock more aesthetically pleasing, a few more touch ups and I should be complete. I haven kept the movement on the hours/minutes and seconds the same to portray the movement of a grandfather clock.
