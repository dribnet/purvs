## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I havent yet had a chance to take pictures for the project, so for the time being ive being experimenting using a picture of my cat. I initially just wanted to get a feel for how the code was working, so ive slightly modified the script to lay the pixels out in a uniform grid like structure rather than at random. 

Im not sure what visual style i'd like for the assignment yet, and i still need to test different kinds of masks.
