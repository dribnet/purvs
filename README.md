## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I got some help from Phoebe and now have the eye glyph working. I might edit it a bit but overall I am happy with how it turned out.

We also fixed the spread of the randomised rects in the billboard mask, which I will change to bank notes and dollar signs. Before hand in I just need to create the bank note and dollar sign glyph and place these into the code.

I am also going to experiment with having the eye made out of bank notes and the billboard filled with a random mix of the eyes and dollar signs.
