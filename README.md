## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've done a lot of illustrator work trying to figure out what I want to do. One thing that I'm really interested in doing is creating depth in each letter, from this I had the idea to have the letters be made from faces within a 3d isometric cube. I made a complete alphabet in illustrator based on this, however when I got about to trying to create it in code, I realised it was way too complex, I then went back and simplified it further and its pretty similar to the a b c that I've done in this commit. I really like this simple style however I can see it being tricky for letters that require a lot of 'faces' as a b c don't which made them easy to create. I also managed to create these shapes using only the original variables as I'm not too sure how to add new ones yet
