I have finished my first version of the entire alphabet. I am still only using 6 parameters, and have mainly been usingthe editor to create each letter. Some of the feedback I got from the lecture suggested I try to add curves instead of straight corners, or that I try to make it look more 'hand made' with bits that stick out the side of the letters. My next steps are to do the numbers and work with this feedback.

My letter parameters so far are simply the x,y coordinates of each point.
  "pointoneX" - first vertex X
  "pointoneY": - first vertex Y
  "pointtwoX": - second vertex X
  "pointtwoY": - second vertex Y
  "pointthreeX": - third vertex X
  "pointthreeY": - third vertex Y
