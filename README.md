Characters in my alphabet are basically created by a series of horizontal lines linning up in column. 5 lines for most of the letters and 9 lines for b,d,h,k,l and numbers.

offsetx = start position of the line
offsety =  length of the line

posx and posy to indicate position of the letter in the rectangle
