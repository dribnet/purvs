## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

This is a new style alphabet that utilizes arcs and lines. I havent actually used arcs before, so to challenge myself and increase my learning, I have decided to start again by utilizing a new style that utilizes arcs. As well as this Ive used a new color pallete,


Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
