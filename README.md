This README explains the random grid of faces for part 3

I have created my grid of random faces. Considering the number of different variables I have within each object, the task could have been horrific, luckily all I had to do was change it within my slider values object and a couple of times in my main sketch.

With my composition again I wanted to play with contrast. There was always meant to be contrast in the faces I was going with, the rag doll face. Contrast between cute and creepy, black and red etc. The rag dolls leant themselves to a slightly chaotic composition, and I added more variables with tilt and hair length, but I still wasn't getting the contrast I wanted. So I had a play with my cartoon faces and discovered that the occassional rank of staunch, orderly cartoons, all staring in the same direction, is the perfect contrast to my higgldy-piggldy ragdolls, and brings out the contrast and controlled chaos I was looking for. Picking out the pinks from the ragdols for the background of the cartoons, along with the black that was already there, helps keep the transition smooth
