### John Maeda's Clock

I recreated one of John Maedas clock where the numbers would scale different sizes in and out whilst changing opacity however i tried adding a twist in which the colours would change on the RBG scale over a sin wave.
However i couldnt exactly get it to work but never the less it still changes colours.

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
