Final Poject

For my final project, I decided to use a line and two arcs to create my alphabet. So I wanted to incorporate round shapes and curves in my alphabet as my initial sketch was made up of rounded rectangles. I was initially going to use rectangles, ellipses, and lines but I realised that it was hard to create letters that need a gap or curves to easily define the letter. I originally used a rectangle and ellipses but I didn't like the look of the sharp lines so I altered it for the edges to be curved. I really liked the look of the rounded, flowing look of the letters and I made it so that is was only the outline of the shape as I wanted my letters to resemble as much as the actual letter.

I decided to use 2 different colours for the arcs to show the different arcs and how the letter is created. When you see the letters transitioning, having the arcs gives the illusion that they are rotating around when going onto the next letter. The colours pair well together and it gives a cool effect when changing letters as it alternates colour.

The parameters per letter:

I defined my parameters by the first letter of the shape and with the value.

  * `a1x` : x position for my arcs and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `a1y` : y position for my arcs and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `a1w` : for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `a1h`: for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `a1Start`: for the direction of which the arc faces/draws.

  * `a2x` : x position for my arcs and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `a2y` : y position for my arcs and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `a2w` : for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `a2h`: for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `a2Start`: for the direction of which the arc faces/draws.
 
  * `l1x` : I have 2 x positions for my line and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `l1y` : I hvae 2 y positions for my line and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.

  * `l2x` : I have 2 x positions for my line and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `l2y` : I hvae 2 y positions for my line and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
