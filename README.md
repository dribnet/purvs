- big update i had struggled with getting the letters to turn out how i wanted and wanted the process to be smother in implememting such as all the skips contained within one parameter but couldnt figure out how to get that done so they have been spread more over the letters 
- all letters have been enetered and show on the alphabet page


24/3
-inital commit came up with concept and implemented a very rough idea of what i want to do i want to be able to have an array withtin the constants that allows there to be more control over what rectangles are drawn.
-added first preview and thumbnail.
-notes of what i want to implement
-added console log to try and get array working

Each of my letters is composed with 20 Rectangles. The size(X and Y) of each rectangle, and their relation to each other is fixed, but the location of which rectangles are drawn in each coloumn is controlled by these parameters:

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
