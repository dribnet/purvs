## Sketch

For my initial idea I want to make a weird alien planet kinda thing. As you zoom in on each island of vines more detail comes up, such as the growing arcs from ps3. I want to try and achieve the same painted look as I did in the last project, as I think it'd look pretty cool here. I plan to achieve this with the same growing and fading shape effect from before
