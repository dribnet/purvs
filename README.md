//For my sketch i have chaged the shape of the letters to rectangle, and also changed the color to red.

//in this update i have changed the design of my letters and also started to add more parameters, for now i got eleven parmeters, it is little bit too much, i might going to change it again in the future.

//cpmpleted the sletch of my new design, i think i will be focus work on this one.

//coped the codes to the draw_letter.js, and fixed some the bug that shiftted the box.

//finished most of the letters, the missing ones still need some "redesign" work, i will start work on them while i put the numbers in.

The eleven parameters per letter:
  * `size` : size of rectegle
  * "rx1": x offset of the no.1 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry1": y offset of the no.1 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx2": x offset of the no.2 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry2": y offset of the no.2 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx3": x offset of the no.3 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry3": y offset of the no.3 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx4": x offset of the no.4 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry4": y offset of the no.4 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx5": x offset of the no.5 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry5": y offset of the no.5 rectegle relative to the first one
