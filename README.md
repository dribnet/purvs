## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

These letters are based upon a 11 point coordinate system. Orignally designed this way to allow for easy of parameter use when drawing the lines as the beginning and ends of each point can just be assigned to the points. For example, the spine of the letter B would have the beginning at point 2, and the ending at point 10.

However, I have not managed to figure out how to make this work properly, and so this current version has a total of 20 parameters, rather than the 12 that it should.
