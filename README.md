## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images that I used are from Shenzhen MOCAP museum.

The image all about geometry, so I think it is quite connect with Pixel.

I did not have too much change in this one, I simply changed the code to draw rectangle and rounds and irregular layout in the images.

I quite like the result but It has not concept behind it.
