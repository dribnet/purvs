I've added my landscape code. Press spacebar to switch between my pattern and landscape, and click the mouse to show different iterations of each part.

My landscape is inspired by retrowave art, especially the colour palette. I also did a creative coding project last year where I depicted a sunset, which I based this idea off of also. I wanted to improve the colour palette and expand on the idea.

The different layers of mountains are done using noise, while the background gradient is done with lines across the canvas, using lerpColor() to change between different colours. 

I think I'm going to add some stars and planets that randomly appear in the sky. My landscape is mostly going to focus on the sky, which I hope is okay.
