## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

With the previous commit I wanted to test out some other image so I used a waterfront picture I took a while back. It turned out interesting but  Ithink the mesh could be done better as the clouds don'r really show through so I think it would be best to stick to flowers or some other theme. the lack of colour in the image makes it not a great image as there is a lot of white so it shows up as nothing. However I like how it looks like a waterolour painting and the layers of triangles make for some interesting water.
