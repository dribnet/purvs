The face has been updated with slider values that change some features of the face. I tried to focus on things that would help seperate different faces from each other. Initially this involved a lot of colour and shading changes to the skin, hair and eyes. However I was trying to think of other visual chnages that would occur between faces, and would relate to my face. I notice the hair segments would be a good one, to indicate the type of hairstyle the inidivual has. Additionally if they have earrings or not. 

With the colours, the skin was a interesting choice to make. There are a lot of bright and vibrant colours for skin tones for the specices of person Zamasu is, so I tried to translate this into a method of showing gender. More masculine faces will appear in the bright green shade, while more femenine faces will appear in a bright pink.
