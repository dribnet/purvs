Looked at the 'e' geometry gaps, but left it as is so that it has even spacing between elements

Moved the 'k' middle circle. It now looks more like a 'k'.

Utilised the third circle to remove gaps on the 'n'.


Might end up making a personal rule to use all elements for each letter, just to make the project uniformed.











I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
