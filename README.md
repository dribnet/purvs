(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Update version of my final alphabet. Decided to focus on block letters, so that each letter is well represented.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
