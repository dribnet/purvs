GRAND GAIA RUNE FOUNDARY

The letters were made using a total of 16 parameters, 8 for each polygon.

The GaiaRune takes me back to the day of what my handwriting used to be. A lot of sharp edges and void of the use of curves. The design of the font is meant to look similar to a kind of medieval rune but still close to the resemblance of the English alphabet.

The colors are based on the Grand Gaia Standard (Color scheme I came up with) where anything grey is considered steel, yellow considered gold and anything green-blue is a crystal of some kind.

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the way everything turned out. The beginning was a struggle to figure out, but I managed to pull through and figure out a style that I could work with.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get the green-blue areas to pulse like I wanted to, due to time constraints...

Parameters = 16

pos(1, 2, 3, 4)x = x value of the vertices for the grey polygons
pos(1, 2, 3, 4)y = y value of the vertices for the grey polygons
cryspos(1, 2, 3, 4)x = x value of the vertices for the green-blue polygons
cryspos(1, 2, 3, 4)y = y value of the vertices for the green-blue polygons
