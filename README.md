## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


I changed one of the images as I wasn't happy with the outcome. The new photo (input 2) is from Lake Rerewhakaaitu. I  also changed the masks as I wanted the "thin" stars to mix with the "thick" ones. I am still trying to find a way to balance the thin and thick stroke. However, I really like the way the palm tree turned out. To blend the thin and thick stars I used different kinds of brushes to create the masks.
