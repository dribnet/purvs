## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I spoke to Hazel about my project and how I can use the glyphs and masks to show my message. Hazel said it would help to bring out the billboards and my message by blurring the background. 

I used Tom's code from today and applied it to the background, then decreased the opacity of the background to mask to help bring out the foreground masks. 

I then incorporated the layering that Tom showed in class. I drew the eyeball on the second layer, on top of the first so that it stands out more. 

I am happy with this progress so far but still want to further improve and detail the glyphs that draw on the masks.
