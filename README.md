## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

Concept Work:
Thus far the plan is to make an alphabet out of overlapping arcs, in which the overlapping part is the shape of the letter. Currently I'm working with two, but I feel a third may have to be added for other letters (E feels like it will be annoying, as does X). I may lean out into using both the arcs and the overlapping space, but ideally I want it just to be the overlap.

Currently, there's an A, a B, and a C. Wow.

Move out of sketch.js.

Transferred sketch data into draw_letters.js and letters.js. Rescaled and positioned existing letters appropriately.
