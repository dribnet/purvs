I have completed the alphabet using my geometric Mayan-inspired font. I have chosen a gold colour scheme which draws back on this inspiration. I have
spent a lot of time ensuring my letters animate smoothly and consistently with the rectangles all remaining in a position relative to each other. My main challenge in creating this alphabet were creating letters which usually consist of angles such as X and Y, when it came to creating these letters I opted for a more abstract approach using my arrangement of rectangles to resemble these letter-forms. Another challenge I had was ensuring each letter and number looked different from each other, such as 8 and B and O and 0. To overcome this challenge I implemented the use of my thinner rectangles, using their spacing to change up my letter forms (for example; 8 has more negative upper spacing than B). I have also put time into refining my code to make it more readable and clearly labelling each section of code, as well as naming variables appropriately. I have also added a few parameters, to make a total of nine. In terms of improvements, I would like to improve the aesthetic of my font to make it look more ancient. I am thinking I could possibly do something with the fill to achieve this look.

My nine parameters.

      * "lengthV1": The length of the first vertical rect.
      * "lengthV2": The length of the second vertical rect.
      * "offsetxV1": x offset of the first vertical rect.
      * "offsetxV2": x offset of the second vertical rect.
      * "offsetyH1": y offset of the first horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyH2": y offset of the second horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyH3": y offset of the third horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyV1" y offset of the first vertical rect.  
      * "offsetyV2" y offset of the second vertical rect.
