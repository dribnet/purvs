## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

first week

I started trying some ideas. I would like to be able to combine the traditional alphabet and the Braille alphabet. I also started to see what a combination of colors can be. This time try something monochromatic on each letter using a different color.

second week

In the second week I kept working on my alphabet design and trying to implement my idea using js. from the beginning I had problems that my ps2 folder moves within ps1 I tried to solve it several times but it happens again.

holidays

during the holidays I continued working on my idea and developed almost all the letters of my alphabet. again I had problems with the location of the ps2 folder but I accommodated it again. I decided to be able to imitate the letters but use similar shapes to my first design. in my particular case having less than 20 parameters is a difficult task but I am trying to improve it. I still have not decided on the colors and if I add the letters in Braille, if I add them I still do not know how to incorporate them into the design and how to continue maintaining the amount of necessary parameters.
