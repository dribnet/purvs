## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I am continuing on with my sky and parachute theme. The initial scene will show a sky full of clouds and as you zoom closer in and past the clouds, the parachuters are revealed. When you zoom in close to the parachuters, smaller details will be revealed such as textures in the colours of their parachutes, faces, smaller clothing details and basic hands and feet. There will also be another layer of smaller parachuters that will appear in the background at the same time as the smaller details are revealed.
