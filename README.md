Started working on my landscape. For my inspiration I searched up isometric island, and based my design off what I saw, as I was wanting to do a floating island and thought isometric tile based would be the best option. 

I have a function that draws a tile, and by creating more functions I will be able to add a lot of variety into my landscape. I also added a random variable to affect the height of each tile , to give the landscape more of a realistic look.
