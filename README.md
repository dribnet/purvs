EXHIBITION WORDS

I have chosen the words that I want to display in the exhibition. I am liking how it's looking so far. Before I finish up I might go back and change a few letters just to polish them up. The words I have chosen are:

NEOTERIC - Name of my font which means modern in Latin.
ABSTRACT - Since the font doesn't fully resemble the letters clearly it has an abstract twist on it. 
CHEERFUL - Since I wanted this font to be playful, makes you happy when you look at it.
ARTISTIC - Creative letterforms
POWERFUL - Bold letters that are powerful and stand out.
POSITIVE - Bight happy font.
THIRTEEN - The number of parameters in my font.

The thirteen parameters per letter:
  * `rectX` : x location of the rectangle
  * `rectY` : y location of the rectangle
  * `rectX2` : x location of the second rectangle
  * `rectY2` : y location of the second rectangle
  * `arcSize` : overall size of arcs 
  * `arcX` : x location of the first arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the first arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the first arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the first arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the second arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the second arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the second arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the second arc
