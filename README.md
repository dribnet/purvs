Color Scheme 2
=======
This colour-scheme is very colorful and reminds me of kindergarten. I like how the colours clash in a bright and fun way, drawing attention to my font and the words they form. Although it stands out, I feel as though it would only work well in certain situations for certain design needs,so this will not be my final color scheme.

My parameters are the 12 boxes that are either on or off depending on which letter they need to make.
