So pretty much all the letters are done. However, the idea of keeping it a blob/jelly seem to slip off a bit and it moved to a brush stroke idea. The reason for this being is because I had to use the editor tool to make my letters which was quite difficult to maintain the blob/jelly idea. Though, I just heard that some people didn't use the editor tool but instead use illustrator..

New idea: brush stroke curve - bringing the different types of brush stroke into alphabet.
