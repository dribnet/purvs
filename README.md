## Part 2

My first face is inspired by Calcifer the fire in Howl's Moving Castle. It's body is made of quads and slider one shows slight variation of its size. The pupil and mouth size can change to express different levels of shock. The brightness can also be altered. 

The second face I wanted to explore having a varying shape and amount of spots. There is also a rotation and saturation control. 

The last one I wanted to create a more complex shape. I chose a tiger. It has varying stripe length, head width and orange colours. The eye value is a discrete variable which determines if the eyes are open, half-closed or closed. There is also an on and off option for the whiskers.
