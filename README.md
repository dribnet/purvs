Today, The editor has since been fixed is very helpful in making my design a little more quirky, I have also added some letters into my exbition. I defenity want to fix my G,2,5 as they work but look similar N,S,Z but that makes sense as they outline the shape of the movement more. I will also play around with my animation cause I think I could have some sharp movements for my red as it doesn't use a opacity which softens it up

The parameters per letter:

  * `redoffsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `redoffset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `offset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one

  *	`opacity` : Colour opacity

  * `offsetx2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offset2x2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset2y2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset3x2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `offset3y2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one
