## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Colours
   
I tried out another combination of colours and stroke, this time I used grey and white. I change the outer arc stroke to be white and slightly thicker. The inner arc I made much thinner so it was just barely visible. Although I don't think this will work with such a thin stroke and light colours. I like the black and white better but this is also interesting to see. It's too bright and doesn't match well together.
