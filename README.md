## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My main idea is inspired by Bauhaus typography. I looked at the us of different shapes which includes arcs, triangles and squares. I want each letter to therefore be based on these shapes, using different colours each time as well. So far I have 8 parameters. At some point i will try change the second arc into a triangle. 


The ten parameters per letter:

- circDiam: the size of the circle
- CircleX: the x position of the circle
- CircleY: the y position of the circle 
- lineX: x position of the rectangle 
- lineY: y position of the rectangle 
- lineH: height of the rectangle 
- lineW: width of the rectangle
