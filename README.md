20/04	|| WORKING ON COMMENTING MY CODE 
|| My letterforms work by having each parameter correspond with one point of each triangle. 2 triangles = 12 parameters per letterform. The red triangle uses the parameter points 1A, 2A, 3A, 1B, 2B, 3B. The black triangle uses the parameter points 1C, 2C, 3C, 1D, 2D, 3D.
|| I used my own functions in draw_letters to create custom shapes to add dots at the points on the triangles. This is purely a technical choice so I can get the interpolate animation to transition without any unintentional overlap. They will be removed before my final hand-in.
