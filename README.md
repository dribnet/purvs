In my design experiment I looked at exploring the use of vibrant colour tones in my composition. This was to allude strongly to the street artist inspiration for the design. I felt the use of varying colour was successful in creating more visual variety.

The use of colour created a very fun and lighthearted design. However, I felt that the overall cohesion of the composition was lost through the use of varied colours.

I felt that the inspiration of 1920s cartoon was almost completely lost through the use of colour. The use of the greyscale was vital to the allusion to 1920s Disney cartoons. As such, I feel that I will most likely revert back to using the greyscale.
