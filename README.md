## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme:
My overall theme for these images is space and astrophotography. I chose this because outside of Uni and Work, my hobby is to take images of space such as Nebulae and Galaxies. I think it would be cool to use my images because these objects in space all have wildly different shapes, sizes and most importantly colors.

Changelog:
Hugely changed the masks for the first two images, I felt like the masks that I had were leaving out a lot of the nebula details and color that I wanted to capture. The first image is where I changed my mask the most and greatly increased its size. Looking at the new masks in the render program I am much more happy with how the images have turned out, especially the "image1". For image 3 I have kept the mask the same, just because its a galaxy and it small on screen, so what I have done instead is made the "Star" shapes smaller, allowing for more refined detail. Before I think it was a lot harder to tell it was a galaxy because with the larger shaps it looked a little cluttered.
