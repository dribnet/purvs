### Added all my emoji drawings.


I have added all of my emoji's to my clock and am trying to now figure out how I can make these more interesting. Maybe they could bounce or something.

I am having a lot of trouble with trying to figure out if I can add a variable to a function when placing it into my clock. As I have drawn all my emoji's as individual functions. I have also changed my colours, they are lighter so they do not take anything away from the emoji's.
