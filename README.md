## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I played around with the code so I could further understand it. I had a go at importing my own images and creating my own masks. I used some photo's I had taken at the Wellington Waterfront late last year, I experimented with how detail comes through with the different settings and what effects I could achieve with it.

I found the code quite easy to navigate and understand.
