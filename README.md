## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have tried to create a custom pixel that has a touch of floral elements while arranging the pixel in a grid formation so it remains structured. I have chosen to create masks that highlight the floral subject of the pictures. 		

In this experiment I was trying to enhance the flowers even more by reducing the distraction of the background. I may try and increase the size of the background squares slightly more as I think it is quite hard to understand the context of the flowers held by two hands. But I may also try and reduce the pixel size to see what a more detailed picture looks like. I do like the contrast between the small rectangles on a grid pattern and the larger circles that overlap each other.
