## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Iteration:
Still trying to figure out what images to use for a final so i'm still making different iterations of my images and selecting the best ones.

I took a picture of some rocks that were exposed from the low tide this time with the addition of two ducks and muscles in the background.

I think i'm happy with my iterations and will just focus on selecting my final images that best visually represent my narrative. I want to try select 3 similar images just to show the connection but I think with the visual aesthetic they will still have the connection.

Photography-wise:
I wanted to capture the rocks and ducks being surrounded by the water to represent in a smaller scale how islands are surrounded also.

Masking/Technical:
Because of my intention with my photography I tried to mask it in a way to show that also, masking the rocks and ducks so the wispy perlin noise would surround the objects that I wanted to be the focal point. Again playing around with the same parameters, still generating 5k particles just different image.

note: Still working outside of the ps4 folder and porting into it once sufficient. I'm sorry if I have forgotten to port files over in other commits.
