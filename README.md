I was inspired by the galaxy in this project. In my part 1 drawing, I found that the clock did not show the passing of time clearly, especially the differences of second, minutes and hours. And people can not recognize the change of hour through my idea of part 1. In my part 2, there is an issue about demonstrating the time like a real clock. People will lose some fun in my clock of part 2. 

Therefore, in this part, I was thinking how to make my design more readable, thoughtful and interesting. I did the research again. And I think galaxy is a good way to show the passing of time. Different elements can be second, minute and hour. Also, the angles of rotation can reflect the second, minute and hour directly. 

So far, this is my initial idea. I will continue to work on my galaxy clock to make it more interesting.
