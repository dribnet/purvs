## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I have decided on my final colour scheme. I like the way the navy backgorund makes the orange, hot pink and green stand out comapred to the lighter background colours. I also decided to move the squares in closer together to start with so that there wsa more rrom to spread out and create more vairation as teh alphabet progresses. 
Also, I decided to add a small green dot that will move around within the given area of each character. This adds another element of differentiation between each character. This dot was in part inspired by the braille alphabet. I thought that this was a nice mix in combination with the semaphore inspired alphabet also.
