This is my alphabet. I use two arcs and two lines as the basis and make the arcs do the extension and the lines do the extension and rotation to complete my alphabet and the numbers. Besides, I also added some elements of chinese character in the alphabet.

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
