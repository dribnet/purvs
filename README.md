## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

This is a system where characters are drawn by the motion of 1-pixel particles
tracing a path between four points that they approach in sequence.

---

### Changes:

- Since I last remembered to commit I got the particle system going as originally designed and implemented the number values.

### Issues:

- There is no practical way to actually animate any of my code in the API

### To-Do:

- Actually get these drawing in draw_letters through some deep voodoo of some sort I guess.

### Notes:

- It seems that I fundamentally misunderstood how the API was used, and my animation code is incompatible with it all.
- Probably I'll need to make the randomisation deterministic and figure out how to speed the whole thing up very very quickly or this simply won't be ready in time. I've been butting against this for the past couple days but nothing seems viable. This is not very fun.
