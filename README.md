Sketch Ideas (sketch.js) - 04/05/20

Hopping onto the sketch.js file I started experiementing with the paramentres(adding/removing). I changed the shapes to a rectangle because to display my alphabet in
a more cubic form. I have created this rough starting point by making the inner sqaures the same colour and the stroke so when they connect, it looks like negative space.

It looks pretty simple now, but I will add more squares to the letters later on so that bits look cut out.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : height of the rect
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rect relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rect relative to the first one

I currently only have three parametres, but I will probably be adding more when I have refined my idea for the type of font style I want to produce for my alphabet.
