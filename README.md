## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Beginning to work with my final images. I am really happy with two of the images, I am still working on capturing the right type of image for one of the parts. My photos are not in thier final order at the moment but my theme revolves around the values that friends have taught me in the past and are teaching me in the present and what types of things I want to value in the future. Friendship is a big part of my life and is something I think that makes a person. Friends teach you the values of who you want to be and different experiences with friends, good or bag, teach you things about yourself and the world around you, which is why I value it so much. I wanted to create something on a personal level that showed gratitude to the people that have been, are in and will be in my life and what they will teach me, whether it was a good friendship or not. 

I wanted the background to be based around nature to signify human nature hence both pictures so far (past and present), being set outside. I have used a picture from my past, but it is my own image and have permission from the people in, because for me it was important to visually represent that time to its truth with the people that were in my life at the time, it also perfectly visually displays the values they taught me. The lighting is quite dark and moody which also emphasises elements of the friendships. It exudes themes of teenage life, courage, new experiences, adventure. I still have not quite come to a good conclusion on what type of custom pixel to use on the black part of the mask because I think it is important to represent humans as clearly as possible but show an emotional side. I really need to perfect my masks but I am working on that, currently just trying to get an idea of what type of shapes work. 

My second image for present is of a few of my friends at the zoo all having fun, taken on a disposable camera which to me represents a sign of the times because of its current popularity. Also again taken in nature, i think it represents a wholesome,loving and happy friendship to show true friendship and support. I want the people to be the focus of the image so want them to have much more clarity than the background. 

I am thinking about using symbols in the mask just to make my different values at different stages more apparent and clear without reading an explanation. This will be the next thing I experiment with.
