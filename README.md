## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I edited the second photo by first making the grass on the field soft and round to contrast with the sharper shapes of the stadium. I made the stadium out of sharp stretched out ellipses to amplify the colours off of the crowd to add a sense of noise to the composition. I made the sky a grid out of ellipses to be quieter in the foreground against the rest of the image but I think I want to play more around with the sky more to give it more movement.
