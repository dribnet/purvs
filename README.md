## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

For my sketch I used 3 different shapes (a triangle, square and circle) as the background for my letters, each in a different colour. Then there is a foreground triangle that has been scaled and rotated to create negative space in the letter and some lines on the side. 

I am now working on my full alphabet using only using circles, triangles and squares to start with, and will add in the lines later on. I decided to get rid of the parameter containing hex code colours that I previously had and will start thinking about an alternative way of adding colour later.
- only F, H, T and 5 to go


The parameters per letter:
  * `backgroundShapeType` : the type of the background shape (triangle, circle, sqaure)
  * `backgroundShapeRotate` : the rotation of the background shape
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the foreground traingle in relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the foreground triangle in relative to the first one
  * `triangleRotate` : roation of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleSize` : size of the foreground triangle
  * `linesVerticalXpos` : the x postion of the vertical lines
