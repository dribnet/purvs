## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2
Continuing work in 'sketch.js' the lines from my previous design have now become triangles. I have tiralled different sizes, triangle shapes, stroke weights, and colours. The colour is now definitley an improvement on the previous versions! Different stroke weights and colours have quite an impact on how noticeable each component of each letter is.

the parameters per letter are:
  offsetx
  offsety
  stroke1
  stroke2
  scale2
