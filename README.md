## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images I chose are some pictures I've taken of different beaches over time. I chose the beach because I liked the idea that each photo would be of the same sea, no matter where I took it in New Zealand. All the photos are of places I've personally been and I wanted to explore the theme of memories through them. The rendered images are all washed out and white around the edges to represent how I remember these pictures, even though the original images capture these places perfectly. My two different rendering types are oil painting-esque, soft colouring and another style that is supposed to show through like line paint strokes.

Process:

I first experimented with the given program and tried editing the opacity of the shapes.

I then experimented with the size and opacity of the same shape (ellipses) to give a more detailed image but still keep a hazy look to it. I also tried creating a list of edges of each line of the mask so that I colour in the mask with only horizontal lines.

I then changed the size of each line and colour so that there would be a 'zooming'-effect. Like how these places would look if I were to drive past them and catch a brief glimpse.

I changed the order of the photos to better suit the order of time of day. I tweaked the program so that when each small line is drawn, there would be a chance for it to continuously draw another line underneath it so that it would imitate a paint stroke.

I added a border to the rendered image so that the images seem less solid and more hazy, and a white overlay over everything to emphasize that too.
