## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Sketch


I want my alphabet to have a simple design, though I haven't settled with this one yet. 

Each of my letters is composed with one arc and one line. The size and position of the arc is fixed, but the location and length of the line and the angles of both arc and line is controlled by six parameters.

The six parameters per letter:

  * `x` : The x coordinate of the first point of the line
  * `y` : The y coordinate of the first point of the line

  * `x2` : The x coordinate of the second point of the line
  * `y2` : The y coordinate of the second point of the line
  
  * `start` : The angle in degrees of where the arc starts
  * `stop` : The angle in degrees of where the arc stops
