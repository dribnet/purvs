I went with a spiral idea, which morphs into a zooming tunnel.

The outer layer is a moving spiral of circles, drawing the eyes to the centre. The centre circle appears ordinary at first, but as you zoom it becomes apparent that it is made up out of lots of lines. The other circles shrink as you zoom, granting more importance to the centre.

There are blue circles draw around the tunnel-like lines to make it seem more 3D and tunnel-like. As you keep zooming, it seems like the tunnel just keeps going. With the last zoom level, the centre where all the lines are draw from rotates around the centre slowly.
