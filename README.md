## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I have completed my alphabet, Im really happy with the way it has turned out. I will probably edit and fix up some characters before hand in. I will also need to work on the animation, I plan on making it either fairly fast or very slow. I might make the animation slow if its changing to a vowel and fast otherwise.
