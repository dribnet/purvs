Episode 00

I am in the process of figuring out how this code works. in combination i am also interating some designs in paper for what the parametric aphabet is going to look like

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size of the circle is fixed and the position is the same as the second circle, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

  MORE TO COME SOON!!!
