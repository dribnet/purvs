## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

FINAL VERSION

For PS2 I brought forward my Gollum inspired face which I created in PS1. Some of the feedback I received around this face was it's lack of likeness to Gollum. Therefore, when mapping the initial facial features to the human faces, I tried to do so with a little more likeness to the real Gollum. As part of this, I changed some of the colours used to more natural tones, created more realistic wrinkles/brows, and reduced the range of the scale of the eyes (less cartoon exaggeration). 

My initial thoughts with setting the properties and values of the faces in training mode was to adjust the sliders based on things like emotion and expression. For example, if the person looked a little dead inside, I made the eyes dull. If they looked happy and passionate, they had big blue eyes (and so forth). However, when I tested this in quiz mode and in review, I realised that this wasn't an accurate way to map the properties I created to the faces. 

For my own faces which I added, I I thought it would be interesting to try to map my face to the real Gollum. Additionally, because Andy Serkis did the motion capture for Gollum - and because Bilbo had a Gollum moment in the first movie - I thought it would be cool to include them too.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get the teeth to work well across the board which is why I created a property to adjust the height of the teeth (so that they sit better in the mouth). That being said, it seems like this is a little hit and miss with some of the faces. However, I am fairly happy with the final version and feel it works well enough with most faces while still referencing my starting inspiration.
