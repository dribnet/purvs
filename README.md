## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

This is the final version of the part 1 exercise. The two characters I choose to create were Zamasu (on the left) from ‘Dragon Ball Super’, and Charjabug (on the right) from Pokemon.

Starting with Zamasu, the art style of ‘Dragon Ball Super’ naturally has a lot of sharp and straight lines with their characters. This results in a lot of complex shapes, but my strategy was to use a lot of quads and triangles to try capture the base essence of what makes the character. 

To begin with, I took a straight facing picture of him and went on to photoshop. I mapped out the head structure with basic shapes, and then tried to replicate it in the code. This repeated with each feature until I was complete. 

I also removed the stroke to achieve a cleaner look.

Charjabug went through a similar process as Zamasu involving using photoshop to map out the shapes then replicating them in javascript. However as a face he was much simpler to create. primarily using rectangles.

Here are links to each character for reference:
