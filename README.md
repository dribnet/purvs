## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Started taking some of the photos that I will end up using for my final. I'm very happy with the picture of the cards and with the picture of the scrabble tiles, however i think that the chess peices need work, I ended up taking this picture later in the day than the other two as I had some things come up and so this resulted in the lighting being fairly different, Ideally I would have the background of the photos which is a peice of dark card that I found be around the same tone. Im hoping that with a more uniform colour there I should be able to target between the background and foreground without using masks a lot more easily. I also think that the more bluer richer colour in th earlier photos creates a nicer colour colour pallete especially when put against the bright red of the cards. because of this I am thinking that the photo of the cards will be my 'final' Another thing that I didnt really take into consideration when taking these photos was just how much I would have to crop them to get them to fit correctly, this meant that I ended up missing out quite a bit of the composition that I was going for, so if I have time when i am retaking the chess photo i might also do the other two. I haven't touched the masks yet as I am not too sure on exactly what I will use them for, Im very keen to use the code seperate between objects, and none of my photos really have a core focus point.
