Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 12 parameters.

The trangles also use a fill with a slight opacty giving it a layered look.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

I have finished inputing the parameters for my alphabet, with each letter being in its final state.

 The only thing I am looking at changing now is the general aesthetic of the letters, such as colour and stroke weight.
 As currently the letters are using a colour scheme I mainly implimented to test the position of each triangle.
