## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

TEST

Since my theme revolves around basketball I will try to incorporate ellipses that look like basketballs into my pixel. These are my initial images.

Using one of the class examples, Final Grid, I modified the sizing of the pixels to see what type of image it would produce. 

At the moment it looks better than I expected as the pixels blend well thanks to the pre-processing done on photoshop to posterise my images. As a result it output the contrast that I wanted.

I will consider adding text to evoke more thought with the audience as I believe my images don't make the impact I want it to.
