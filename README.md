This morning I added in code to create two thick lines on two adjacent sides of the first triangle, and one thinck line on one side of the second triangle. I have not increased the number of parameters as the line x and y coordinates are controlled by the same offsets as the triangles. 

  "offset1": triangle 1 x, line 1 and 2 x
  "offset2": triangle 2 x, line 3 x
  "offset3": triangle 1 y, line 1 and 2 y
  "offset4": triangle 2 y, line 3 y
  "rotate1": triangle 1 line 1 and 2 rotation
  "rotate2": triangle 2 line 3 rotation

These additional lines make the font more interesting but more importantly help form letters F, G, I, J, P, U, and Y, which cannot be made using two triangles alone. From here I need to finish the remaining letters and implement the final part of the code.
