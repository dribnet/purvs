Initial Sketches

Using an object that holds a shapes array that contains lists of more shapes that contains arrays.I have managed to keep my parameters lower than 12.The intial idea is just some oragami letters.I have used the beginshape tool.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `shapes` : array that holds more objects and array lists
  * `x` : x array of x co ordinates that draw multiple shapes
  * `y` : y array of y co ordinates that draw multiple shapes
  * `col`: makes every shape the assigned colour
