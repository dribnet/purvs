I like the outcome of my final design and i think changing the stroke weight of my lines made my design a lot more interesting and not as simple as it was when i used three lines that were all the same stroke weight. The smallest changes can really change the design and make it look a lot more effective and sucessfull. I wanted my design to be very readable instead of it being abstract. There were some challenges as I could only create the alphabet with three lines. The only abstract letters and numbers that do get confusing is the letter E and O and the number 8. The others are very straight forward and easy to read.
