## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

These images have been created using the SmartMask program. I have used masks such as 'person', 'frisbee' and 'potted plant' in my images. I like the way this program creates quality masks for images, but I also enjoy the freedom you have when making your own masks in photoshop.

(The three images are of Extreme Frisbee with two players lunging for the frisbee, a couple standing infront of a rainbow in a desert, and a bunch of potted plants.)
