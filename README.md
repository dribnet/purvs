Although my previous design was nice, I became unsatisfied with it very quickly. I attempted to analyse why and found out a few possible reasons. The first was that it didnâ€™t seem to have any obvious points of attention where viewers would look, the wallpaper is just presented as a whole and its a bit much to take in. 

Additionally to the previous point, one the viewer has taken the design in, there isn't really much variance of interesting locations to look at, it's mostly the same. With the stroke in I started to feel there may be too many lines in the design, but without the stroke I felt there was not much definement.

So I decided to take the design along a slightly different path to fix these issues, but still keep the elements that interest me such as the transparency overlay.

I modified the wallpaper so there are clear segments that work together. The rows of solid dark boxes touching each other, and the rows of boxes which do not touch each other and have some negative space. The differences between the rows give the viewers something to look at and it helps guide their eyes across the design. The light and dark difference help highlight this and it also appears a lot neater.

The overlapping ellipses are given a size variance, so now they will overlap in more different and interesting ways, and the transparency allows each box to show the overlaying colours. 

As the box pattern reminded me of a movie theater, I imagined that this wallpaper would make sense to be used there in theory, and so I skewed the colours to be more red to match the theme.
