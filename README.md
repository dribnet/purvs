(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two arcs. The size and position of the first arc is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters. The arc angles are determined by the two parameters `arcStart` and `arcStop`. These make the 'wedge-like' shapes.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `arcStart` : starting angle (in radians) of the arc
  * `arcStop` : end angle (in radians) of the arc
