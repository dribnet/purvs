I have edited the photos to be darker and more desaturated, and tweaked the gray areas on the masks to create a better blurry patch. I replaed the random jitter with a noise jitter because it spreads the ellipses out much better. I have made them disperse more across the x axis to give a smudgy effect. I changed the way I was trying to draw the ellipses with a second loop to making a second pass lik the class tutorial. I am currently working on creating an array of colours to randomly fill the ellipses with to give it more variation. I am finding this to be quite difficult but will have another look at it another day.
