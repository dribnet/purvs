## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


I am designing a 'font' to be used in a graphic design way, it is made from triangles and is not 100% totally readable as the mainstream and typical forms of the letter. I do not want the letters to be instantly recognisable but I do want them to have some resemblance and readability that they could be used in abstract graphic design. I want my letters to made from the most minimal amount of parameters possible. Doing this through triangles might be a little bit difficult. I might experiment with arcs rather than triangles. I wanted to use a limited colour scheme. I have set myself the challenge of trying to be good at using triangles since I have not really used them in my other designs in creative coding. 

Realising the limitations to the design I had sketched out and some changes I will have to make to make it fit within the alphabet boundaries. I will make my red triangle able to be a different size and also need to do my letters that have 3 triangles. It should only mean I have 12 parameters for some letters and some will still have only 6. I will keep coding what I have in my sketch so I can get to know my design better and realise the limitations for particular letters.

Here are my parameters for each letter so far
  'triX1' - the first x point
  triY1 - the first y point
  triX2 - the second x point
  triY2 - the second y point
  triX3 - the third x point
  triY3 - the third y point
