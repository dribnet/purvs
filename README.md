### Coconut Clock

My initial idea was to have a coconut tree as my clock. I orginally had planned to use a photoshop image to make the tops and leaves of the trees however as linking an image would be harder and we haven't been taught this so far i decided to simplify and have a more abstract approach, using the colours as opposed to coding the tree itself. I have used the bars so that its counting down time as opposed to adding time kind of looking more at how much time you have left in the day.
