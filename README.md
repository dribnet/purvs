Each of my three letters here are made up of two lines. The center point of each letter is the only one with a defined variable, it always sits in the middle vertically. 

The two other points both have x and y coordinates with the center one only having an x offset variable. I tried to look at how i could simplify the letters into as few lines as possible. However im not certain this concept will be practical for an entire alphabet as 5 variables may be too much.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
