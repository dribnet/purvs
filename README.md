##VINPIXEL

From the very outset of this project, I wanted to create a font that was completely inspired by pixel art and vintage computer type. I have tried incorporating fonts like these in my design work for other papers this year because I love the retro and simplistic design language. Early on in the project, I looked for fonts online that I could use as precedents for my project. I found fonts like [Retro Gaming](https://www.dafont.com/retro-gaming.font), [Dogica](https://www.dafont.com/dogica.font) and [8-bit Arcade Font](https://www.dafont.com/8-bit-arcade.font), I knew almost immediately that I wanted to recreate a similar design but simplify it further and add a little bit more flair.

The first concept that I played around with can be seen in my physical sketch, I wanted to make the letters out of a few square 'pixels' which is a theme that I stuck with through the whole project. Another thing that stuck around in spirit is the concept that I wanted to make a very specific type of interpolation. I didn't know at the time that this would be quite challenging and something not a lot of my classmates desired to do. Really, my main inspiration was after I had thought of my initial concept, we were shown a project called [Type me, Type Me Not by Peter Cho](http://www.typotopo.com/typemenot/index.html). The third example which was one square that 'flipped' between letters as you typed was the fuel I needed to take thus project to the next level. What I really loved about Peter Cho's project was its ability to have the 'retro pixel' look while still being able to being something new and interesting to the table, I knew that I wanted to create a sort of spiritual successor to his project. The first interpolation that  I would concept out would be a type of falling animation where the pixels would fall into their corresponding place on the grid. This concept was super interesting to me but ultimately I thought that it didn't fit with the theme of vintage computer that I was going for. The same thing happened for my other initial interpolation concept, I wanted the pixels to shrink and grow when it changed but that faced the same issue as the other initial concept, it just wasn't very computer-y.
