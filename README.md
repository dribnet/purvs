This README explains the randomly paramaterized faces for part3. 

I chose my summer sprite to work on, as it was the most aesthetically pleasing for me, and means that I can add a lot of different parameters. 

The number of leaves are randomised, along with the number of twigs growing out of it's head. The position of both the twigs and leaves are randomised also. I chose these parameters to change as they allowed for a wide range of variation.

The mouth and eyes also open and close.
