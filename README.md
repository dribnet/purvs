## Powers of 10 PRINT

I have noticed that when it is really zoomed in, it gets a bit boring as the background is very plain. Therefore I have added a corner shape pattern at zoom 7 and onwards. This helps keep it interesting. 

But I also have a problem as it's showing up in front of the dots which isn't what I want. I'm not sure why it's doing this as I have put it before the dots in the code. 

I have also got the tour coordinates done. It goes to zoom level 3, 6, 7 & 8 which I feel are the most important layers.
