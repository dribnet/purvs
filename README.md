## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Believe I forgot to update the readme in last commit.

Iteration:
Still trying to figure out what images to use for a final so i've still making different iterations of my images and selecting the best ones.

Again I have used an image underneath a part of a dock. 
Photography-wise:
I wanted to capture the tunnel like view through the underneath of the docks I liked the border of that the dock created and the contrast between the dark black border and the colours of the ocean.

Masking/Technical:
 I applied the mask in a way to capture the border and the details because I wanted that part to be crisp and clean to show more of a contrast between the border and the ocean. I experimented with different parameters for each of the images again. Scaling the strokeweight of the lines in the mask by 0.6 > 1.2 for the iterations and for the noise outside the mask were from 0.1 > 0.5.

 Because the images are created generatively I let the first and last image render longer than the one in the middle hence why it has more brightness and more of the image actually rendered over the noise.
