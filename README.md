## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Continuing to use the perlin noise algorithm, This time with my own images. The flowfield has a lot of undulating lines which reminds me of the ocean, for my own images I have pictures of the ocean by Red rocks, Wellington. The first image is an image of a rock protruding out of the water and I had 2000 particles be generated to create the flowfield. The second image is seaweed underneath the water and I had 4000 particles generated to create the flowfield. The last image is a low angle shot of a rockpool with 6000 particles. I applied no masks to the image. 

I have ported my code into the ps4 project but since the program is generating so many particles it is quite laggy and unoptimized so the rendering of the images is very slow. I will continue to iterate outside of the project folder and then port my code as I progress through. I want to try different image rendering algorithms but I believe I will continue along the theme of using my images of the New Zealand ocean as it is personally significant to me and I find the Perlin Noise algorithm best compliments the images. The reason the ocean is personally significant to me is because of my culture(Maori) and the Ta-Va theory. All of the polynesian islands are spread out around the ocean in a close proximity though it is the thing that disconnects us it is also the thing that connects us, the ocean is the binding force this is represented through the output image and the connection of dense lines creating blocks of colour(Islands) and the disconnection through the sparse lines creating negative space.
