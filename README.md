Looking into the generative landscape I wanted to continue my decade based influence. I looked at creating an 80's inspired landscape for this section of the problem set. I used noise waves to create the mountain and wave forms. These are then complemented by the bright horizontal and vertical lines.

I have made the majority of variables used in the design adjustable so the user can create their own desired landscape.
