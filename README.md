Name : Blocks puzzle

Let's just forget constellation, it does not look like them at all.

So from my exploration, I think those two triangles could be blocks and the ellipse is the intersection.

I've now finished A-Z then I am gonna work on 1-9 and the default one.


size = ellipse size

posx = x-coordinate of the ellipse 1

posy = y-coordinate of the ellipse 1 

posx2 = x-coordinate of the ellipse 2

posy2 = y-coordinate of the ellipse 2 

t1 = x-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 1

t2 = y-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 1

t3 = x-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 1

t4 = y-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 1

t5 = x-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 1

t6 = y-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 1

r1 = x-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 2

r2 = y-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 2

r3 = x-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 2

r4 = y-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 2

r5 = x-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 2

r6 = y-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 2
