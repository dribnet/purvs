## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images I have chosen for this project are photos I took in 2016 when I went to Japan. This was taken at one of the aquariums I went to when I studied abroad. The reason why I wanted to use these images is because I personally think that jellyfish are spectacular creatures. I find them to be quite beautiful and I really like the pink neon vibes the image get off. I'm quite excited to see what I come up with for these images!
