## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

PART 1:

I have transferred my design from PS1 over to the new code, but have also made a few small adjustments based on the feedback from my peers.

A lot of the feedback concerned either distribution or the face not looking enough like Gollum's. In addition, the lack of variance in the randomness - this in particular I have tried to address.

First, I removed the bias to look to the right. This has resulted in a greater variety of eyesight directions. 

Second, I slightly increased the size of the mouth so that it is easier to notice the different widths. 

Last of all, I reduced the stroke weight of the eyebrows so that you could see the individual strokes at their smaller scale. There was some criticism around the brows falling down below the eyes. However, this was intentional in the first place in order to achieve the exaggerated cartoon eye bulge effect.
