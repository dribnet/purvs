## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

Decided to change my original idea of using my project 3 wallpaper idea to creating a pattern of what looks to me like rows of flowers. The "petals" grow and contract to different sizes randomly. Each stage changes the flowers slightly from colours to shape. I really like that way it is starting to work out with the map and zoom functions, I think the final result will be quite interesting.
