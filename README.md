### Maeda Clock #2

My original geometric clock idea beyond my coding abilities so I have chosen to iterate and develop my second idea which is a clock made from ellipses. I have put one of coded my numbers into a function and improved the position of the ellipses so they now perfectly line up when moving around the page, creating more abstract shapes rather than just a number. To further develop this I need to code the rest of my geometric numbers. I would like to map the fill of the stroke to the seconds/minutes/hours on the clock so there is a gradual shift as time passes.
