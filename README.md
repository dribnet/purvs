## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My first commit was me just playing around with the code and looking at travel as an idea. I had airplane windows which were all the same and then what was through the window was different. This class I thought, "this doesn't really mean anything". Today I looked at humans immersed in nature. I wanted to convey the idea of humans and nature being one as we are destroying it. The three images are simply me playing around with the code and this idea. I haven't used my own images yet and think it would be good to perhaps have a wellington based area.
