## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

p4:for my photo i use code "rotate" to draw some white space mke it looks more protruding. the line of the sky make it looks like a pencil drawing.


p3: in this part i change my code to draw my photo, i change cut position of the runset image, it can my mask more easy to draw and it have more space for the sky. changing the code make sure it looks good for my final.

p2:in this part i draw 3 layer for my image, i draw some picture on the mask, it looks fun, and i will change the code later  , see how it work if it doesnt work well i have sraw the mask again.

p1:the 3 photo i select is sunrise mid-day and sunset, i take those photo on those day, the color change of the sky especially interesting. i begin  to use my own code to draw this 3 image now.
