## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - AGING

I have added my mum's photo to represent an older generation in the theme. Now, I will just tweak the masks and maybe edit the black and white filter. Other than that, I might try and find a way to have a blurry filter but if not I will just  be making the tileWidth and tileHeight size = 1 so that all three photos are clear.

(Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.)
