This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

For the first face is of a cat. One slider changes the rotation of the face, while one slider changes if the eyes are open or not. This was the face that I figured out how to use the sliders.

The second face is me playing around with a glow effect. One slider changes the amount of glow around the face, another changes the amount of sparkles, another controls how big the sparkles are. There is also a slider for opening and closing the eyes.

The third face is a summer spirit. There is a slider for whether or not the mouth is open, another for the whether or not the eyes are open, another for the position of the leaves surrounding the sprout and the twigs coming out from the top, and another for the amount of twigs. I plan on developing this one further.
