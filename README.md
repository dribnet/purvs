### Maeda Clock


My idea for the clock is to have 60 lines across a canvas, 
each represents a minute and will slowly move down the canvas
as the minute progresses. I am currently trying to figure out
how to integrate an hour hand into the clock and I was thinking
about placing the hour on the y axis and place 12 lines horinzontally,
the time would be identified by looking at the location of both lines.
