## Cells

This map is an abstract representation of a cellular system. It shows the cells and their bonds, as well as the space in-between them and how the cells interact with each other, randomly scattered throughout their space like a liquid would be.

This flowing pattern will become more detailed with every level as it is zoomed into. More bonds appear, then green energy in the background, then more detail in the bonds before the nucleus appears in the center of each cell. If I was to develop this further, I think movement within the cell could lift this design up another level, however it would slow down the program and affect the user experience.

I wanted to keep my colours as complementary as possible, as I'm aware that this design can look fairly chaotic in some ways, so I felt that controlling these was important. I have kept them calm and relaxed, taking inspiration from an underwater colour scheme.
