## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

My initial idea is to reveal a second layer of parachuters inside the frame of the first parachuters parachute strings. They will be significantly smaller as though in the distance. I may also include some detail in the colours of the clothes and parachutes with multiple similarly coloured shapes making up the larger shape. I could also use parachuter silhouettes instead of shapes.
