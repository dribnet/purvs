## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I changed input 2, AGAIN, because I still wasn't happy with the outcome. I like that the sky looks like a painting but I don't really like the edges of the building. I will try to change the draw stars function to horizontal lines, it may blend better with the sky. However, I really don't want to lose the current effect of the palm tree.
