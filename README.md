I'm trying to change my sketch to get that working before I start on my alphabet but it's confusing!

I've realized that I was thinking about this totally wrong and my initial design will not work! for this design to actually work I would need to use way to many parameters so now I need to rethink my design. I could try to figur out a variation on the same theam with fewer parameters but I think that might be kind of boring. I liked the idea of using for loops and that might give me a lot of controll while still no having too many parameters. I'll probably have to do some tests on my own as to how I'm going to make that work.

A fun preview of my alphabet! the code is super messy and definetly not the most clean and reasonable way of doing it because I got really confused at how everything was working at first and then by the time I figured it out everything was already all messy but I get it now so I should be all good for the real deal. The idea is tht I'm drawing my letters using the base lines with a square as a base. Lines can connect between the four corners and the centers of each of the squares lines to create the letters. Everytime there is a closed off shape in a letter there is a blue square in the center. I'm not sure on the color theam yet, I usually just use really basic colors at first and then refine a theam later. Also I know the A looks like a tecno elder wand. That was unintentional.
