## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

25/03	My letterforms work by having each parameter correspond with one point of each triangle. 2 triangles = 12 parameters per letterform. This is going to be a difficult concept when drawing letters which have three stems (uppercase E, M, W etc).
I have successfully managed to port my sketch.js into my draw_letters.js and letters.js files! My letterforms habe taken a slightly different structure (they are now more elongated) but the idea remains the same.
