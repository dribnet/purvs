## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel (FOCUS)
By Thomas Hartley
Focus
The images above represent a persons focus in terms of their perspective. Some people focus on their partners, some on material pocessions, others focus on the life itself. This is meant to enchance this idea by 'focusing' on the specific item cascaded by the mask and then distort the background by bluring and nudging it to push the perspective soley on the item itself.

Testing:
The nudge and distortion went through several methods of testing before finding the final version. This includes changing the pixel density (size of iteration), boundaries of the color, aspect of the color filtering, type of nudge (perlin noise, general rotation, etc). However none kept the focus in perspective as well as the error dithering style with nudge and filteration.
