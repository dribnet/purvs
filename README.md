This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part4. 

It's a shame I had to forego the animations from the first one, but by fiddling around with the new 'random' code, I think I managed to capture the scribbly animation in still life.

Population-wise, I decided to have the average fish-face be thin with two eyes, and a 50/40/10 split on the colours (blue, brown, and yellow, respectively). The yellow fish tend to lean to the left, the brown fish to the right, and the blue is the most centered, with a -30 to 30 gap.
