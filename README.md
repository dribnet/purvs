My initial idea was use the rectangle to compose the graphic and pixel style letters by changing the position and the size of rectangles. 

At the beginning, I use two rectangles to create the alphabet and there was 7 parameters. However, even the letters are unnessary to be recognisable, it is still hard to differentiate with each other by using two rectangle. So I desided to use three squares instead of two rectangles. Then there was 9 parameters, the variables x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3 control the position, and the s1, s2, s3 control the size.

let pos2y = 0+letterData["y1"];
  let size1 = letterData["s1"];

  let pos3x = letterData["x2"];
  let pos3y = 50+letterData["y2"];

  let pos4x = letterData["x3"];
  let pos4y = letterData["y3"];
  let size3 = letterData["s3"];

For the colours, In order to give the letter a digital aesthetic and also separate the squares, I used the black background and white, red, grey for font color.
