Character set name
HubbaBub

8 parameters for the two circles and line

cx1: X position of circle 1
cy1: Y position of circle 1
cx2: X position of circle 2
cy2: y position of circle 2

x1: x position of point 1 of the line
y1: y position of point 1 of the line
x2: x position of point 2 of the line
y2: y position of point 2 of the line


My alphabet is inspired by the blocky bubble letters that I often used for titles in primary school 
with big round letters and an overall chunky and clunky aesthetic.

Early on, some people commented on my design looked like they were faces. I changed the colours to a 
yellow square with black lines and dots which made them look like face. Trouble was most people saw 
a pair of beady eyes which made it hard to read and somewhat uncomfortable, not the original intent 
of my design

It wasn't only until after changing the colours several times after when experimenting before I settled on 
a pink monochrome scheme with white. This ended up reminding me heavily of fonts and lettering on 
candy and lollies, especially Hubba Bubba with its round and bubbly type

As tribute to the brand that helped me get my fillings, I named my character set HubbaBub, with various
sweet / candy related words for my exhibition display. 

It uses two circles and a line to draw each letter, which puts me at 8 parameters. I tried to keep the
numbers of parameters low that way I could dip into the extras if I needed to make a particularily hard
character. I got all the way up to G when I was particularily tempted to use my last four variables to
add another line. It was at this point when I realised having all the letters use the same number of shapes
would really help with the cohesiveness of the design. This is why I added the additional circle on the
left leg of A where it only used a line and a circle previously. This is also why you see me use the dots
for letters like O and I where it couldv'e been done with just the line. 

Another design decision I made was to try keep similar looking characters different. Such as 5 and s
could've potentially looked very similar. I made these different where it was possible. 

I didnt really make any changes to my characters for lerping because I kept the locations of the features 
consistent. for example, circle 1 would always be above circle 2 ect. I didn't need to further adjust the
speeds of my transitions of my lerping either due to this because all the features just float into place
which works well with the bubbly theme.
