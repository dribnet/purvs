## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

These are some small tweaks to the design that take elements from both of my recent ideas. this version is stroke based instead fill based as I felt the previous commit was too similar to the actual photos. With this one I removed the white grid, and added ellipse at the crossover poinst to highlight them. I like this look, could be a little more abstract and colourful, I think thats probably how I will use a mask.
