## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Hey guys. So the theme I chosen is "Passion". Reason for this is I feel like doing something that is about me rather than a subjective broad idea. My passion is creativity so I have used images based on the proejcts I have done at Uni. First image is my prototype creation for first year whereas the 2nd image is my final form physical creation. These two creations made my passion for creativity/ and purpose for uni more passionate. Following you passion is a good thing.
