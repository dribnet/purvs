TRINITY! 

I have created an alphabet entirely from two triangles and called it Trinity! Trintiy because of the 3 sides of a triangle. 
When thinking of what i would like to create my alphabet from i drew out circles, lines, arcs and triangles on a piece of paper and saw how many letters i could get from each and found that i didn't have much inspiration from the others thus choosing to use 2 triangles and a line. Origianlly my idea was to have the two triangles and a line that ran through the middle of some letters like E and F but after trailing that i decided to get rid of the line as it made the alphabet feel and look inconsistent, having the line also went over the 12 parameter limit. 

When creating Trinity I found that the restriction of only 2 triangles provided me with a challenge when creating the numbers, as i found it was harder to manipulate the triangles to create legible numbers than it was to create each letter. However, i have tried my hardest to resemble each number the best i could.

When chosing the look i didn't particualry have anything in mind but knew i wanted colour as opposed to black and white. I used Adobe Kuler to play around with different colour combinations. I orginally had my colours as orange with a purple outline but felt this was quite overpowering giving me more traffic cone vibes. I decided to tone it down chosing a cool blue with a redish pink outline which complement one another well.

If i were to continue with this assignment i would look more into improving the some of the numberforms letterforms such as the 4, 5, N and Z.

In saying that however i am happy with the progress i made and think the transitions from one letterform to the next are quite cool to look at. I am pleased with how Trinty tuned out.

The parameters per letter are now:
  let pos1x = posx + letterData["x"];
  let pos1y = posy + letterData["y"];
  let pos2x = posx + letterData["2x"];
  let pos2y = posy + letterData["2y"];
  let pos3x = posx + letterData["3x"];
  let pos3y = posy + letterData["3y"];
    
  let pos4x = posx + letterData["4x"];
  let pos4y = posy + letterData["4y"];
  let pos5x = posx + letterData["5x"];
  let pos5y = posy + letterData["5y"];
  let pos6x = posx + letterData["6x"];
  let pos6y = posy + letterData["6y"];
