Experiment 1

During my first experiment I created my letters from shapes not simply squares. As I realized I could not have the number of parameters I wanted without exceeding 12. 


With these parameters in place I realized that I had to change the way I had originally designed my letter forms. At first, I was trying not to abstract the characters but once I realized I couldn't really remain within my parameters whilst having clearer letter forms I decided that they would have to be abstracted. However, I have ended up really liking this abstraction but I would like my letter forms to differ a little more than they do now. Perhaps I could change the colour of some squares. Or rethink the shapes which I have now. Another thing I put into place is the grid being situated above my shapes so that my rectangular shapes can move about beneath them, rather than simply filling a singular grid at one time.

My parameters at the moment are;

Right-which filled the right side of the box
Left-which filled the left side of the box.
Top-Filled the Top of the box.
Bottom- Filled the Bottom of the box.
M1- Filled Middle two squares in the first row.
M2- Filled Middle two squares in the second row.
M3- Filled Middle two squares in the third row.
M4- Filled Middle two squares in the fourth row.
