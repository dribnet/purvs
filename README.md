## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

The style I chose to develop over the course of this project was largely inspired by the former street artist dui, BMD. It was also heavily inspired by early 1920s cartoons and also modern adaptations of this style such as the video game Cuphead.

When regarding this project I approached it with a design first perspective. I created my intial design in Illustrator. When I had created a form I felt was unique and successful I moved to working with code to re-create the design. Working design first allowed me to refine this design without the restrictions of thinking about the parameterised features. I felt this was a key factor in the refined style I was able to produce.

Once I had re-created the form in code I started to consider which features could be adapted into parameterised values. I looked at randomising look direction, orientation, ear length, and eye and teeth number.

I still felt that the characters felt too similar, amd so I intriduced two new face styles to the piece. I added a bird design and a dog design. This helped to significantly improve variety in the design whilst maintaing a strong degree of cohesion.

As I refined the concept I added key features that I felt strengthened the emotive range of the design. This was primarily through the inclusion of eyelids, which significantly improved the range of emtoions. Pupil size was also useful in creating distinct personalities across the various characters.

To add visual interest and hierarchy to the design I made it so that the characters hover in place, with a shadow below them shrinking and growing relative to the peak of the hvoering movement. The movement served to break up the flat appearance of the composition and maintain visual interest. The shadows served to establish a stronger system to the layout and provide more meaning to the composition. The shadows and layout serve to further strengthen the allusion to BMDs art, as these are both techniques they employ regularly.
