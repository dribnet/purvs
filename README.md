This is the first idea for my alphabet, and I only created ABC for a trial. 
For my letters, they might be formed by triangular or diamond shapes and they
may be looked abstract. 

And I got an inspiration from a movie 'Star trek', the alien letters or characters.
Therefore, I decided to create some alien letters instead of English letters.
But I still try to make the rest of letters in the next step.
