Project updates for Karen O'Brien

Last night I had a sudden idea to completely change my idea from embroidery themed to a thermal image theme. With this, I'm also changing this project from a more personal based image series to a social/ current issue series. Not only do I feel that the bright colours of a thermal coloured image will be significantly more effective and eyecatching as art on a billboard in the middle of the CBD, but I think that I will be able to create a much more interesting and meaningful message.

As New Zealand recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, I want to use this project to remind Wellington of how quickly diseases can spread and the importance of social distancing. In my image series I will be using the warmest colours of bright red, orange and yellow to represent a person infected with Covid-19, contrasting with the blue shades of the background.
