## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2


Refined my lemonade theme a bit more, changed the background to a lovely green colour which works well with the yellow. I also inputted lemonade related words into the file. 

ALSO i didn't know we were meant to change the index file with each commit! i have finally changed it now to show the alphabet.html. All my commits thus far have sketch.html as the index. oops! i will remember to change it for the final commits as well. 

Just refined this a little bit more, Im working on the stroke s that the yellow letters stand out more on top of the lemon. I think its just a small visibility issue.
