## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

## My Homes

The idea to do show 2 places that I currently call home. The image on the left is shot at the waterfront in Wellington, New Zealand. The image on the right is shot at a decommissioned cross-country train track in Singapore. The image on the center is the flags of the two nations.

I was born and raised in Singapore. I left Singapore at age 26 to further my studies in New Zealand. The flight to Wellington was my first time taking a flight on my own with no friends and family members. It is now my 2nd year in Wellington.

I have decided to create impressionism-like images as I wanted to do something that was traditionally hand-made but recreate it with a digital twist. Impressionist painting is often characterised by the visible form of the brush strokes. My work features different glyphs and symbols as "brush strokes" of the painting. This "brushstroke" are outlined to enhance the visibility of the individual glyphs.

The timing of this project is also quite coincidental as both nations recently signed a "NZ-Singapore Enhanced Partnership" agreement to strengthen the relation of both countries which I now call home.
