## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I tried playing around with the colours in the grey area of the mask. I changed the blue value for when red is less than blue to a lower number to mute the colours more. I actually really like how this effect turned out in the 3rd picture with the grass. However, unfortunately it made the sky yellow in the 1st picture which I really did not like. If I want to keep this effect I will go back into the mask for the 1st picture and make that area of the sky to black or white so that it is not within the if statement to change the colours.

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
