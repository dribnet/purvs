Each of my letters use three points...2 are fixed and 1 is controlled by two offset parameters.

The parameters are:
 
 offsetx : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
 offsety : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one



At this time I still want to use a blue,orange,black,white, color palette, and thought I would make this commit, then work on graphic details.
