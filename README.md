## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I changed the numbers of lines being drawn to a lower number. This made it look less like a star, and more like horinzontal hatching. I think it blends in more nicely on all three images. Now that I am happy with both functions, I am going to try again with the photo of the lake and flower. It wasn't working before, but it may work now with the hatching effect.
