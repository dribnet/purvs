## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Unfortunately this past week and half I have been really sick and with a 40% assignment due in the same week for another class, I have started this assignment a little later than I would have liked. 

For my design I went with a colourful and refreshing colour palette with light blues, pinks and yellows. For the design of the alphabet I decided to keep it a little simple (due to the time constraints.) I have chosen an arc to help shape the letters, these shapes are inspired by the pacman character.  

Added a rectangle shape as I felt like it adds more depth to the letters, some extra parameters of the rectangle eg. stroke and angle. 

Updated the interaction.html to work with my interpolations and parameters. 

The parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `start` : start of the arc in degrees.
  * `mode` : end mode of the arc in degrees.
  * `pos3x` : x position of the rect
  * `pos3y` : y position of the rect
  * `width` : width of the rect
  * `height` : height of the rect
  * `stroke` : weight of the stroke of the rect
  * `angle` : angle of the rect
