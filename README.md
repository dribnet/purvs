## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Animation
   
I tested out the colours but I couldn't get it to work with variables so I tried some other things but no luck, I'm too sure how I would make it but so far I'm stuck on how to make it change colour when it rotates or something. I tried adding different variables and setting them in the interpolate function but nothing so far.
I tested it again I forgot to call the variable I set for colour so that was why it wasn't showing up. It shows but still no colour change. I'm not sure what the problem is and I cannot seem to figure it out.


pos2x this draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y this draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x this draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 this rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 this rotates the inner arc
