Sketch Two

Here is another sketch where I was experimenting with some different styles for my alphabet. Here I have gone for thinner lines and letters that are more obviously readable, however I think I do prefer my original sketch because I like how every square in it was the same size where as here the sizes of the squares vary depending on the letter.

Parameters:

  * `sizex` : size of x axis of smaller boxes
  * `sizey` : size of y axis of smaller boxes
  * 'offsetx' : x offset determines x position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * 'offsety' : y offset determines y position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * `boxX` : x position of second small square, relative to big square
  * `boxY` : y position of second small square, relative to big square
