FINAL PARAMETER FACES BEFORE FOCUS/REFINED DISTRIBUTION

I have finished my designs and the parameters for each of my faces. I am happy with the cartoon look of the bears as that is what I was aiming for originally. I think the three face//bear types still remain cohesive as they share this simplistic design whilst having differences between face types and between face to face. I'm happy that I managed to code a bunch of different ears as I think they, and the eyes / blush detail, make a big difference in changing the overall look of the face and then the smaller details are clearer as you look closer. I'm also happy I managed to get the mouth curve parameter working.

The parameters for each face are:

Face One(Panda):
- Size / Scale of the face (Continuous)
- Ear style (Discrete)
- Cheeks/blush (Discrete)
- Mouth/ Smile curve (Continuous)
- Eye patch size (Continous)


Face Two(Brown Bear):
- Size/ Scale of the face(Continous)
- Ear Style (Discrete)
- Eye Patch Style (Discrete)
- Mouth Outer size (Continous)
- Mouth/ Smile curve (Continous)


Face Three(Polar Bear):
- Size / Scale of the face (Continuous)
- Ear style (Discrete)
- Mouth/ Smile curve (Continuous)
- Mouth Outer size (Continous)
- Eye Patch Style (Discrete)
