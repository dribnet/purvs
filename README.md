### TOYFONT
My final alphabet is called Toyfont which is mostly inspired by toy blocks. So that's why my alphabets are all made up of circle, triangle, and rectangle. Actually, I used ‘arc’ function to create circle since I realised that using the arc function is good for making both semicircle or circle. For the colours , at first, I was going to go with vivid colours such as red and yellow and green just like a real Toy Block, but I actually found that it looked too distracted, so I chose to go with a little bit more calm colours. I wanted my design to be readable instead of it being abstract. There were some challenges as I could only create the one shape of each. I designed it as close to the actual alphabet as possible, but with the exception of some abstract characters that are confusing, others are straightforward and easy to read.

Overall I’m pretty happy with my alphabet and it was made as originally intended.


The 14 parameters per letter:

triX1 : X1 offset of the triangle
triY1 : Y1 offset of the triangle
triX2 : X2 offset of the triangle
triY2 : Y2 offset of the triangle
triX3 : X3 offset of the triangle
triY3 : Y3 offset of the triangle
rectX : X offset of the rectangle
rectY : Y offset of the rectangle
rectW : Widh of the rectangle
rectH : Height of the rectangle
arcX : X offset of the arc
arcY : Y offset of the arc
arcS : Angle to start the arc
arcE : Angle to stop the arc
arcW : Width of the arc
arcH : Height of the arc
