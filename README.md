I tested out some colours for mt letter forms and I think that this red fill on the inner arc is interesting but I don't think it looks that great filled in. I like the colour though. Maybe if it was all filled in or all filled in with a different stroke or just have the outer filled in would be interesting to see. For now I'm not sure about the colours but I think it would be nice to see the outer and inner with two different colours that either contrast or compilement.  

pos2x this draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y this draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x this draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 this rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 this rotates the inner arc
