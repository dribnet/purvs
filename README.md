## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - 30/05/19

Experimenting and Ideation

I have updated the input images to some photos I took in/on the way to Hong Kong. I haven't made many changes to the code yet at the moment, I'm just trying out the grid code from the class example, and am fiddling with using lines.
I'm still thinking about the theme I want to explore. Currently I'm thinking about either sustainability, or the importance of spending time with your loved ones
I might go to the botanic gardens or have a look at photos I already have.
