## May 2nd

There have been many changes to the code.  I have added many parameters.
The next steps will be to make the last 3 letters and the numbers.  Then it will be on to interpolation.
I have used some of jeremymaih's code as a foundation for my letters.  Here is the link https://bl.ocks.org/jeremymaih/99e8644e3b6b4ec8ef263a254e0f017f/a389cc22435a93266aad7e4361f7d655367b045e

The ideas and color scheme of my alphabet will be entirely different from jeremymaih's code.
I am unsure if I should add another rectangle to make some letters more defined.
