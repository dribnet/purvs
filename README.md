### Clock Concepts

I forgot to change the read me file for the first upload, but pretty the upload is just my initial ideas and concepts. The second upload is me getting started on the imitation clock, where i had to work out a way to not have to hard code all the squares.

This upload, I have refined my concepts down to ones that stem straight from my inspiration pictures on the top left and top right.
What I have finalised is a joint idea from both concepts, although this can definately be extended further.
