## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I'm finally sold on a mask for my slinky, I inverted the white mask to a black mask on photoshop to see if I would get an interesting results. I really like how it turned out, the overlap of the paint blobs really emphasize the transition of colours. I've also used the hatching on my other images and I thought that the hatching on the mask of the slinky didn't show its full potential. The hatching in the background of the image is subtle but necessary for this image. I feel If I had the hatching on the very thin lines of the slinky it wouldn't stand out as well against the blob background. The whole canvas unifies all the colour and pixels well. I've adjusted the rubiks cube now and played around more with the grey scaling. I am now going to go back through and make sure everything is up to scratch. The hatching in amounst the paint blobs looks like someone has dry brushed a real painting and there is bristle strokes from the brush on the canvas. This is a really cool effect and gives it authenticity. I feel as though I have communicated my abstracted/playful theme. It is eye catching, colourful and demands attention which are all qualities that A billboard seeks to achieve for the audience. If it makes it up on the billboard, I hope it grabs peoples attention.
