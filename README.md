## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This version i added a new photo for the 3rd input that was more of a fit with the other two and
created a new version of my scribble as horizontal scratches to make the pictures come across as kind of creepy.
I used two for loops to create lines that zig zagged away from the pixel.

I also started creating a function for the shattered glass which looks good, but i'm not sure if it gives enough 
detail to the background for my liking. I might test with the shattered glass as the body and make the background 
a pixelated grid.
