## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Each of my letters is composed with 12 circles. Each of the 12 circles is shadowed by another circle of different colour.

The 24 parameters per letter:
  * circle(#)x = x position of circle. x12
  * circle(#)y = y position of circle. x12
  * squareback = fixed.

I went in and made my sketch - roughly and then coded draw_letters. Due to the numerous parameters needed as there are many circles this took some time. I also went and started to interpolate my letters but then realised I may need to create them first! I changed my editor info to more accurate sliders so that its easier for me to plan out each letter/num.
