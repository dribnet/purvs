I thought about not using smartmasking, but I tried it on my 3rd photo, and found the smartmask was more cleaner than if I used Photoshop.

For example, the edges are clean with smartmasking, but with Photoshop the edges were jaggered.



However, the smartmask couldn't identify the object in input_2. Also for input_1 it actually recognized the object as a teddy bear, but it didn't completely cover the bear.

So I'll stick with a manual mask for image 1 & 2, and use smartmasking for image 3.
