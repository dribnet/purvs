### Sand Clock

So far I nearly finish my clock. I have not do the triangle masks yet but now the clock is readable. I code each hour and minute but now the shift form one number to another is not so smooth. I plan to do some effects such as fade-in or fade-out between the shift. I use the pink coulurs now but I may change them in the future. Also I plan change colours when the time past.
