## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

my second attempt at my sketch and i definitley think it was more succesful!! I changed up my design to use only squares/rectangles and i think this will be more effective and simple?? 

I sketched everything out beforehand again

also had alternatives for some letters/numbers
and i also played with how i wanted the shapes to layer over one another, and i decided that i wanted the "first" shape on top and the rest to come out from behind. 

I also rounded the edges of the rectangles as an alternative to me not being able to use the arcs i wanted to use haha

also another reason why i chose to stray away from arcs is to make this project look different from my last one. When i was playing with them before they looked quite similar to my last project and i want this one to look different. 

I do want to make it colourful and have each different shape a different colour but i felt i should get the base code down first and play with colours later as i have a tendency to focus on that until i get it exactly right. so i just left it blue for now.
