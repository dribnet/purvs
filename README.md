## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I experimented using the grid technique that Tom showed us in class. I replaced the main mask with repeating ellipses and the background mask is long rectangles with a separation above them. 

I am liking how the ellipses look on the main mask so I am thinking I might go with this in my future iterations.

I am still thinking about what my theme could be. After the lecture I have been considering some global themes. I thought since that we are presenting our work on a billboard I could do something with consumerism and try get the viewer to think about how media can try to manipulate the viewer.

The guest lecturer also talked about human impacts like extinction of species, pollution, global warming etc.


I just talked to Phoebe about my ideas and I think I will go ahead with the consumerism idea. I plan on taking images of billboards and utilising the mask to portray a message. I am still thinking about what my specific message will be but it could be along the lines of the work that goes into creating that product (sweatshops) or how the products we buy often go to waste or they are purchased for their 'status'.
