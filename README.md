## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I changed the background colour to black. It doesn't look as good as the white background because the images I have are light.

I tried different sizes for the bee and in the end made it small. I considered how it would look when it's on the bus shelter, and it probably would be a fine size.

The bee can't be seen because it's getting covered by the other shapes which is a problem.
