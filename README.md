### Helix clock. 

This is my final design, which i called the Helix clock. It shows the speed of the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. I changed my idea a lot but i stuck with this at the end as i thought it was my strongest design. It is very simple but effective. 
I wanted the main focus to be on the helix waves hence why the made the background black. 
When the alarm sets off, the ellipses’ grow in size and also changes in colour. I changed the colour onto yellow and green as i wanted it to really stand out and to be somewhat in-your-face. The outcome of the alarm was really good a portrayed the feeling of an alarm going off. 
I came across a lot of obstacles during this project and it made it harder that t i couldn’t decide on one idea. But as i looked at all my deigns and sketches, the Helix Clock stood out to me the most. 
I disregarded the idea of actually showing the time in my clock and just to show the speed of time. 
Im happy with how my clock turned out. Its a very simple deisgn but effective design to show the speed of time.
