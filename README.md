## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

So I've gone for an abstract aproach, I have done letter A-D and am going to try and finish my alphabet tonight. I have been reall busy with animation and have fallen behind abit. I want to add opacity onto one of the triangles so there is a cool colour change inbetween the two.


My letter parameters


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.

opacity - colour opacity

strokeWeight - weight of the shape stroke
