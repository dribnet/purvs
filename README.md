## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

### Dithering


At this point I was looking at the technique of dither.So dither is an intentionally applied form of noise to randomize error,preventing large scale patterns such as color banding in images.I really like this style it since its audio linked in a way.This was one way I achieved a sense of blur to really pull focus away from the flower.


Giving the veiwer a sense of form but not so much detai.What this does is link to the idea that all the things we consider beautiful in todays society can be veiwed online through our screens.From a design point of view I am always seeing beautiful images created through photoshop and such.

What I wanted to show with the background images was a pixelized version of layered flowers.This emphasises the screen aspect seeing images is just made up of pixels.

The background of my phone is to really create a black and white contrast drawing your eye to the color of the flower.By drawing the interesting lines this does create a sense of movement by each peice being random.


All together I think im acheiving my intentions of highlighting the effect technology has had on us especially in how we miss the beauty of nature everyday relying on the internet to provide us something we can achieve just by stoping for a sec to smell the flowers.
