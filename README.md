| 13/05/2020 | Managed to get letterA to work however, my variables are starting to balloon trying to get the other shapes, and is becoming a bit of a headache to produce. I'm having to add variables for each letter and I imagine as I do the whole alphabet I would discover even more will be needed. With this in mind I will likely be changing my design to work with the arcs/triangles idea I also had hand-sketched.									  |
| 11/05/2020 | Initial work on sketch letters. Deciding on horizontal lines as the design I want to pursue, I have modified the draw variables to work for that.																		 |
| 10/05/2020 | Current design direction is to base the characters off the Aurebesh Alphabet from the Star Wars universe. Initial drawn sketch idea replaced.																	 |
