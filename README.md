Alphabet

For my final alphabet I decided to stick to experiment two as I liked the way this looked and believe that it gives each letter form more individuality. My letters are not obvious but that is how I want them to be. They are like their own code. The letterforms remind me of a puzzle therefore I wanted to make them a puzzle to read. However, I also believe it is important to have some easily distinguished letters within it such as A, B, C.
