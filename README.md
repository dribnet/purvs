## Ps4 Paramaterised Map  


This is a framework that generate parameterised map of space. The program allows user to zoom-in up to ten levels depth to explore the details of nebula and planets. 

The initial idea of this project was transfer my code from PS3 to create an infinite starry sky. By adding more details to higher level of zoom, the view and experience will be changed completely but the goal is making the change more subtle as user zooms in.
