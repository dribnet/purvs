## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2: Cutout Shadows


I wanted to make a typeface with shadows that are a little abstract but seem plausible in the shapes that create them. They appear to run up the wall with a visible source, and are interpolated so the shaded form morphs nicely, and is "shuffled" with some rotation to the entire shape.

I do like how the character of the letters changed when I switched from the initial circle background shape to a square. I think this change did a lot to bring everything together, though each letterform is not perfect.
The entire idea does focus a lot more on the forms themselves than their animation, mainly due to the large amount of parameters I set in making a fully articulated bezier blob.
