### Tree clock

I took inspiration from the way that you can tell how old a tree is by the amount of rings there are on the trunk. I would like to show the tree growing older through this. In winter the tree grows a lot slower due to the weather which shown by the dark rings that you can see, the ligther rings between the darker ones are the spring/summer growth where the tree grows a lot more.
