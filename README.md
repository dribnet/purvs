## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I finished off and re adjusted a few of my letters for my alphabet and I'm really happy with how they're looking. Each letter is unique and interesting, capitvating to the eye while still being connected to the letter's around it. I think I will make a couple more changes as I come closer to handing in. 

Today I've also edited the interaction.js to add my new parameters, I love clicking through the different letters to see the actual motion from letter to letter. This has really brought my inital idea to life, of the rays 'rearranging' their position to form each new letter. My idea has changed a touch but I'm definitely much happier with how it's turned out now than my first plan. I initally was only going to have the lines change their position to move closer together, further apart, point outwards, or point inwards, but I was never planning on their thickness, rotation, or overall size to become much smaller, etc etc, all these little things I didn't originally even think about are now the reason my alphabet is so fun and exciting to look at. My original classic rainbow has now become swirly, interestingly rotated, thick, thin, tiny, curvy, windy, twisted, all the things.

With the exhibition.js, I've got two words so far RAINBOW & KIERAMCK, I'm going to have a think of some more interesting words to use. But the words look so epic so far. I've also gone through and beautified my draw_letters.js and letters.js.
