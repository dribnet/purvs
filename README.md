## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

I have decided on the face style I wish to continue with for this project.
It's an abstraction of a particular tattoo artist's style I really enjoy.

I have now set up my 3x5 grid, and started using the focusedRandom() method to achieve more variety in my faces.
The randomisation in this composition consists of:
the combination of the face shapes, mouth 'curvature', pupil direction, and nose and chin sizing and positioning.
