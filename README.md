## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I add two more details for the the crystalball zoom and for the last zoom in version I add a white flower, I also change the background colour because I want it little bit warm. I still has the problem with the animation I just want my white flower can rotate by the center but I even can not make the pattern move with the example, I think I really need fix this with tutor or Tom tomorrow morning before the due time cause I do not want give up the animation.
