## Initial Ideas

Since my last project was more of an abstract representation of time, for this project I want to do more of a 'literal' font for this project.

For my idea I wanted to experiment with remixing the existing font of Helvetica Neue, currently i'm thinking of the user will select a letter(A,B,C) it will generate the normal letter and through changing the parameters with sliders the form will change or have the form be created by different objects(ellipses,points,etc) I believe this can be achieved easily but for the more complex parameters I believe I will have to generate a image of the font and manipulate the pixels of that image.


In this experiment I found the framework confusing so I just stripped it down to focus on the fundamental basics then will slowly implement my code into the framework once I understand it better. As a starting point I just want the size of the text to change by the slider.
