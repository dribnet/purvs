(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with 4 symastic quadrangles. Two of them are filled with different colors without edges, the other two I just kept the edges instead of filling any colors in them. Each of them can be changed in size and positions. And there are 3 parameters to control each of them. So there are 12 parameters in my each letter. 

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `size1` : the size of the red quadrangles
  * `posX1` : the X position of the red quadrangle
  * `posY1` : the Y position of the red quadrangle
