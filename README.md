## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Read me for Karen O'Brien's Parametric alphabet

Originally for this project I wanted to create a retro / geometric inspired alphabet, however after some sketching I found that this idea didn't come out with my desired result. While I am still sticking with a retro theme, I'm shifting my inspiration towards the font of old video games with a pixel art staticky feel. I want to be able to create the illusion of movement with this alphabet even though it is still a static image, hence the blue and red colour splitting and slight blur effect of CRT monitors. The shapes of the letters are very pixelated and blocky which also takes reference from this design style. While the shapes this alphabet is composed of are relatively simple, effective colour and illusion of movement, as well as having an overall sense of cohesiveness and nostalgia will be the main goal.

Currently my letters are a bit off centred but this will be edited once I have finished designing the full alphabet.

Each of my letters consists of 10 square pixels in a 5x5 square grid which can be altered by their x and y co-ordinates.

The twenty parameters per letter:
x1 = Pixel 1/10 x co-ordinate position
y1 = Pixel 1/10 y co-ordinate position

x2 = ''
y2 = ''

x3 = ''
y3 = ''

x4 = ''
y4 = ''

x5 = ''
y5 = ''

x6 = ''
y6 = ''

x7 = ''
y7 = ''

x8 = ''
y8 = ''

x9 = ''
y9 = ''

x10 = ''
y10 = ''
