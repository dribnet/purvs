## A-Z

I have been continuing with making my letters and have now finished A-Z and just have the numbers left. I'm pretty happy with the shapes at this stage, they are nicely readable and none of them look too similar to each other. I'm starting to think that the design is rather simple as all my parameters are just changing the x and y and rotating the drawn shapes, so I might think of something extra to add to make it a bit more interesting.

I currently have 9 parameters;
	"offsetx": X position of the first leaf
    "offsety": Y position of the first leaf
    "leaf2Posx": X position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "leaf2Posy": Y position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "rotate1": rotation angle of the first leaf
    "rotate2": rotation angle of the second leaf
    "rotate3": rotation angle of the stick
    "stickPosx": X position of the stick in relation to first leaf
    "stickPosy": Y position of the stick in relation to first leaf
