## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos I took when i was in Philippines algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. 
The only changed i made to the code was the size of the pointSize and halfSize as you can see the image better when the ellipses and squares are smaller in size.
