## PS1 MDDN 342 2017


##Final README.

##This should include a summary of all of the work leading up to the final version (which I am omitting in ##this example), so it should be longer than the other READMEs.

##In my final version I have used a shifted grid layout with some jitter.

I have brought the code from my last project across to start getting everything together for ps2.
