## Alphabet in Stars.

The initial thing in my head is really simple which is point, line, face. Everydrawing is from those three shapes. Therefore, I will contains those three elements in my design.
I have different ideas about this project. 

1.Map/Maze. This idea is about using a map as background. Afterward, when alphabet appear there will be a different color of line follow the map's track to present the shape of the alphabet.

2.Stars. I will draw a star sky as the background. Then link those stars together to draw the alphabet. In addition, those lines will combine a face, the color of the face is colorful. This design will help viewers recognise the alphabet better. 

I will have try of both idea and find out the better one.
