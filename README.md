## Progress #1
Doesn't work on chrome to well.

In the last update I said I wanted to create this 'literal font' but remixed and I went on to figure out how to generate a image of the font and manipulate the pixels. 

I thought I would have to use the createImage function but I did some research on my inspirations/precedents and stumbled upon the generative gestaltung book for web and it showed a way to create what I wanted to do. In this commit it's an example from the book and I've just been playing around with the code and removing things so I can understand it better to create my own font based on it.
