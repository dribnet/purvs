### Episode 01 Initiating Design ideas

After finally figuring out how this odd journal works we can begin the
very first episode of this project. As shown on the picture above show the following concepts:

concept one: moving timers
-based on newtons cradle
-the secs will be in total sink with how the ball moves in motion
-hectic coding/might take some time

concept Two: Giant Oversize Numbers
-hand drawn numbers that changes
-cartoonish feel, as numbers change based on time
-hectic coding/more design/ might take some time

concept Three: Time/Day clock
-simple straightforward clock
-background changes depending on time
-simple straightforward/ could improve to a more complex design/ easier

your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
