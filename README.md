## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Part 1

First idea - 05/05/20

My idea is to have a continuous line with a set amount of vertices along it, and each of these vertices can be manipulated depending on the letter. This idea came from talking abouot the project with my boyfriend, who suggested a worm that bends into each letter. I am starting out with only 3 vertices. Each letter has the same straight line as a starting position. It will be an uppercase alphabet. I need to make it more visually interesting and colourful as well, as it looks pretty boring at the moment. 
It is made using a beginShape() and endShape(), with no fill so just the outline can be seen. This creates a continuous line without having to draw each line seperately. 

My letter parameters so far are simply the x,y coordinates of each point.
  "pointoneX" - first vertex X
  "pointoneY": - first vertex Y
  "pointtwoX": - second vertex X
  "pointtwoY": - second vertex Y
  "pointthreeX": - third vertex X
  "pointthreeY": - third vertex Y
