## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

my first attempt at making my favourite of my designs. unfortunately i was unsucessful. for some reason i couldn't get the arc to work for the letter B on my sketch and i also used too many parameters.

i drew quite a few designs on paper before i started coding:

and i was inspired a lot (especially in the last design by this: https://imgur.com/4NzFYbz design)

i will have to redesign and figure out how i want everything to work. I don't think i will be able to use as many shapes as i want to, which is kind of annoying but i don't have enough variables. 

things to change/fix: varibles (need to cut down), get shapes working for other letters other than 'A'

things i like: colours - i really want to use lots of colours - in my drawing i used felts to colour in the shapes, and since i had 2 of each shape i gave them both a pairing of colours (the triangles were red and orange etc) i want to do something like that where it is quite bright and colourful.    

(hopefully the imgur links work)
