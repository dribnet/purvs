## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
I've been experimenting with different pixel shapes and applying multiple masks so that I can have lots of pixel shapes on the image instead of just two. I used some of the techniques shown in the recent colour tutorials for input 1 and I think it looks really really cool and bold, however I feel like it does kind of stray away slightly from my 'autumn' theme as it's very digital and neon. I think I will play around a bit more before commiting to a definite theme. I also really like the background with the different sized rects, I particularly like the longer more rectangular shaped rects on the right side, the trees in the back look really funky with this effect too. 

Input 2 has been a bit harder to work with, since there isn't anything bold or infront of the frame like input 1 & 3, everything is at the same hierachy level. You can roughly see the girl in her denim jeans and sweatshirt which does look cool, she almost looks like a shapeshifter but at the moment everything in the photo just seems to merg together.
