## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
For my theme, I decided to use photos from one of my earlier photography projects where I explored the relationship with old possessions of mine that have significant value to me. I thought I would develop this idea through this project and continue to explore these items of sentimental value. Inputs 1 – 3 shows old toys that I used to play with (Slinky, Lego’s and a rubik’s cube), the colours look nice and vibrant and all look cohesive when all shown together. I've changed the masks on afue subjects on the picture to isolate the area that I want to draw attention to. I am looking forward to experiment with the pixel and really push the colours on the canvas. Note – Having problems with getting my thumbnail and preview on chrome with the atom live server (Shift F1 images aren’t showing on the png).
