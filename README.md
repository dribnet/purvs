 Today I completed the rest of my letters. I am still yet to make the numbers but I plan to sketch and complete those tomorrow.
 I also plan to begin the animation part tomorrow once all of the characters are done.

 I ended up redesigning the Y and the Q for both consistency throughout my alphabet and efficiency. I realised it would be quicker and easier to recognise if I just changed the arrangement of the cut outs for these two letters. I am open to doing this on other letters I have already made if my feedback suggests I should do so.

 Next steps are numbers and animations.
