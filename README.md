Here are the forst seven letters of the alphabet, using the arcs. So far, I am happy with how these letters have turned out. I am not 100% satisfied with the design of the f, however, I wish to continue with my alphabet, just so I have a better idea of how my alphabet will look together as a whole. Once my alphabet is complete, I will consider whether I need to make changes based on preference and design cohesion. I do lke the idea of having the darkest colour represent either the stem of the letter form, or the portion of the letter form that goes beneath the base, so I plan to continue with that approach. I would like to try to and prevent the dark colour from overlapping, however that may not be possible. 

The fourteen parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
