Theme & Photographic Sketches.

My theme is Pasifika Identity in Aotearoa New Zealand. With Samoan Language week coming up and the cultural aspect of this theme I thought it would be an interesting theme to do. 

I have photographs of older images that I did not take but was hoping to use them. But for a first photographic sketch I used an old image of my uncle doing a pasifika performance at high school. Not sure if I can use an old image that I didn't take but it's only a sketch.

 I was thinking of using an image I have of my tattoo, and other images of my younger siblings and cousins in their pasifika outfits, contrasting it to the older image of my uncle but, again, not sure if I can use that image. 

 A back up I have is an image of the ocean in the middle with 2 other images of my younger siblings and cousins at their pasifika performance- highlighting the idea of 'One Ocean' meaning 'We are One'.

 But, for now, I have used this grey image and played around with the code a little, getting familiar with it. Also need to do the mask too.
