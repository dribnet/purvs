This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

I enjoy some randomness in my work, so I've gone and created a slider to control just that. The first sketchy face is reminiscent of my style of drawing

Second face was just me fiddling around with alpha sliders. I attached everything to one slider so that the effects of starvation happened all at once. It looked kinda silly with bags under the eyes or sunken cheeks without the other.

third face is Sketchy as well, but I wanted to play around with beziers. I attatched the hight of one of the beziers to the mouth slider so that when the mouth slider moves up and down, it moves the arc as well.
I added a special function to change the shapes of the eyes and the ability to move the eyes with the mouse position.
