(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with a rectangle and two arcs. 

The fourteen parameters per letter:

  * `CPX1`: centerpoint of first arc XPosition,
  * `CPY1`: centerpoint of first arc YPosition,
  * `R1`: Radius of first arc,
  * `SA1`: staring angle of first arc,
  * `EA1`: ending angle of first arc,

  * `CPX2`: centerpoint of second arc XPosition,
  * `CPY2`: centerpoint of second arc YPosition,
  * `R2`: Radius of second arc,
  * `SA2`: staring angle of second arc,
  * `EA2`: ending angle of second arc,

  * `X1`: starting XPos of rectangle,
  * `Y1`: starting YPos of rectangle,
  * `X2`: ending XPos of rectangle,
  * `Y2`: ending XPos of rectangle
