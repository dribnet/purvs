<b>Alarm added</b>

Got an alarm function up and running, including a new wheel when the alarm is triggered that counts down
until it goes off. I altered the x position of the numbers with millis to give it the affect of rapidly expanding and then
contracting, however I'd like to make something a bit smoother for my final clock. This is just the best I've come up with so far.
