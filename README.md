I am in a rush today, so I havn't made major changes to the new code (part two) we were given today, but I have played around with the code a bit to familiarize myself. I read through the alphabet.js and changed the background colour of it. I then went into the draw_letters.js and changed the colours to match the colour scheme I came up with in my initial sketch. I then changed the ellipses to rectangles. I also had a look at the letters.js to make sure I understood that too and so far so good. These are minor changes, but they have helped me to feel comfortable with the new code/concepts and not fall behind. I plan to make more sketches of some differentideas when I can. 

Parameters below are for my initial sketch, and dont apply to the alpahbet and draw letters ect yet.

Parameters:
  * `size` : Of the largest rectangle that always stays the same
  * `wid` : The width of a smaller rect that will 'cut hole'
  * 'hei' : The height of a smaller rect that will 'cut hole'
  * 'offsetx' : x offset of first rect that will 'cut hole' in relation to large stationary one
  * 'offsety' : y offset of first rect that will 'cut hole' in relation to large stationary one
  * `b2offsetx` : x offset of the second rect in relation to the large stationary one
  * `b2offsety` : y offset of the second rect in relation to the large stationary one
