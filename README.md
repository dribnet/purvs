### Final arrangement

I wasn't sure on how to arrange my faces. I wanted to show a lot of them to convey the variation, but i also wanted to show them quite large to show the detail in each one. I decided to organize them in columns, with two columns showing larger versions and the other 5 showing smaller ones. Im quite happy with this arrangement as it achieves what i wanted. 

I made some final tweaks, adjusting the mouth slightly and adding lipstick to the make up slider. I also tweaked the the nose a bit, and also added an outline to the face itself. 

Ive added a blue background, however i felt that this was a bit simple so i also drew a white circle behind each face. 

Overall im very happy with my final design, I had a clear goal right from my initial sketch and i focused heavily on achieving this design. I wanted to create a face that could transition from extremely basic, to over the top and dramatic. I would possibly have liked to add more variation to the face itself, but im satisfied with what ive managed to create.
