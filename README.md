## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've now completed my main letters, now to move onto the numbers. I want to keep the same style but continue to use 2 triangles rather than adding an extra one, I want to push the boundaries by just using two. 

My letter parameters

section y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.
