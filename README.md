## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Alphabet

Compared with the draft, I added an arc to its base, rotated these shapes, and combined them to become new letters. In order to make the letters easily recognizable, I did not use the bow and arrow as a fixed pairing to make abstract letters, but instead, the bow and arrow were split and the arrow did not appear in a fixed pattern, just to make the picture look richer and more distinctive.

As I updated the alphabet, the shapes and parameters gradually increased. If I simply used white on black as in the draft, I would not be able to distinguish the components. So I changed the color from black and white to a richer three colors, and the orange background also makes the picture look more lively and fresh.
