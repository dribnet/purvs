## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

  idea: draw the design out of circles and arcs with varying opacities so it has a sorta ghost-like effect. I could use true/false features to make cloudy effects in the back. I plan to assign a colour palette to each letter using if statements - there was a good website shown in the second class for that. My design will be a little abstract, bt I want people to be able to tell what each letter is after they're told

today I changed the colour scheme and resized all my letters because I realesed some of them were going way outside the box. I think next I'm gunna start adding custom shapes using functions like we were shown in the lecture to make my design a bit more dynamic and interesting. I like the idea of leaning into a watery vibe - maybe I'll add squiggly lines
