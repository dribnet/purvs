## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

The images I chose are some pictures I've taken of different beaches over time. The opacity and size of the ellipses colouring the sky decrease the longer the program renders so that more details are added and to give a hazy/dream-like mood to the photos.
