## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme:
I have chosen farming as my theme for this project as it is something personal to me that I care about. Dairy farming gets a lot of bad media that does not express what farming is really about. Therefore, I took into consideration the location of where the work would be displayed as most people who may view it will have a limited experience with farming. I want to express the beauty of farming through my eyes as I have lived on a farm my whole life and contrast the bad pictures that are presented in the media. I wanted to take photos that captured the elements of my farm that I found beautiful and worth showing off. Living in Taranaki, I found it especially important to feature Mt Taranaki and the cows.

Process:
My ideas developed over the two weeks mainly driven by the class tutorials as I experimented with them and kept aspects of the tutorials that I liked the best for my images. I used 4 different colours in my mask to have different shapes that express textures within the images and highlight the parts I want the user to focus on. I did experiment with using the grid example, but I did not like the effect that it created so I went back to the original starting code to draw the pixels. I did use the grid example to draw the eyes of the cows as I wanted the circles to stand out and draw on top of the other shapes. I added the cross-hatching effect to the parts of the sky that did not have any differing colours to make the image more interesting. I found that without it, the images were relatively plain, and the background was quite flat.
My favourite image is the last one as It has a lot of texture from the original photo. I like that the ovals overlap slightly and blend the different colours together.


The images above are photos from around my farm in Taranaki algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
