## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

As of now, this is the final iteration for my problem set four. I continued to build on the cell composition, and develop detail down each level. I think that the final composition works quite well, and is intersting enough to explore. I added a little bit of colour just to keep things interesting, as it became very dull after a while.
