Security Zone

I have decided to switch back to my wallpaper asthetic from ps3. There I use hexagons to create a sc-fi themed wall. I have kept to tat theme and created a hive community of security bots. From a far this swarm is not detailed. As you get closer the form of each individual drone is more noticable. On closer inspection each drone has green lights, acting like eye. If the user gets too close these lights turn red as if the drones have switch to a more aggresive security mode.
