## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Ive changed my idea and render process once more. Ive now decided to take some pictures of my roommates infront of their room walls that they have decorated. After masking, Ive created a render process which should resul in a slight networky picture where the background wall is solid circles which all link together while the subject is much harder to discern due to the cubes being hollow.
