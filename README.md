## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My custom pixel is made up of a gridded circle layout where there is a mask with multiple different layers of a greyscale colour that is picked up by the sketch code. If the colour is within the set range it draws the circle on the grid at a different size, creating a scaling effect.

I added an offset to see what it would like.
After doing some research ive decided to go towards a roy lichtenstein art style for my finale image.

So for my project i really wanted to incorporate some drawing into it as i like to draw. Hence why i went for a more illustrative approach.
The skin of the characters are drawn with ellipses that ranges in sizes along the shdadows. However the background of the ellipses are drawn with the same colour as the image background so theres a sense of transparency to the ellipses.
The theme i tried to capture was just people wearing headphones as i think the aesthetic is quite nice. I just looked up people wearing headphones on pinterest and drew what i thought would look nice.
