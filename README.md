Got started on all the facial features, and now have to get them all to where i like the look of them. Still playing around with the eyes, not sure what to do with them yet, so I'll leave them to last. Got the nose working, so it can be facing left right or straight. Need to touch up the eyebrows and cheeks as they can go off the face from certian angles. 

The face is slowly getting better, still not to do some experimentation to see what suits my style.
