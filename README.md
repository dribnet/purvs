I have named my font! "Cubefont". I feel this define the style, as the entire alphabet is composed of cubes and this is still visable in the final version of the alphabet as each letter conforms to similar cubes. 

Parameters:

  * `sizeB1x` : size of x length of two of the smaller boxes
  * `sizeB1y` : size of y length of two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2x' : size of x length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * 'sizeB2y' : size of y length of other two of the smaller boxes
  * `posB1x` : x position of first small square
  * `posB1y` : y position of first small square
  * 'posB2x' : x position of the second small square
  * 'posB2y' : y position of the second small square
  * `posB3x` : x position of the third small square
  * `posB3y` : y position of the third small square
  * 'posB4x' : x position of the fourth small square
  * 'posB4y' : y position of the fourth small square
