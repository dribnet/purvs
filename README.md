## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Now I put my photos into the pixel renderer. I changed the rotation and gap of each pixel on the background so that, compared with previous version, they are more readable now. Besides, I tried to refine the original background colour as well. At the beginning, I tried to turn all of the background pixels into balck and white. Then I thought it was too boring so I set the HUE and Saturation into 204 and 46 to get the bule shader on the background. But the colour now is still a little bit green so I will change the HUE and Saturation later to turn it into pure blue.
The reason why I choose the colour of blue is that blue represent the mood of sadness and frustration, which is the opposite of the delightful red on the foreground. It will make the colour of happiness more emphasised.
Moreover, I did some change on the random size of flowers as well. However, it is still not obvious. At the same time, I find some problems. I set the random number for the size of flower leaves. Howerver, when the program draw the flowers, rather than draw each flower in different size (but all the leaves will in the same size in one flower), it would draw a flower with leaves that in different size. I think I need a var to contain and preserve the number from a random range, and then apply this number on each leaf.
