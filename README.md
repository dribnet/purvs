ADDING FACES TO MY FILTER

Here I am just creating an upset face to incorporate into my design. I currently have it around my outlines of the girl. I like the concept and idea of it but I'm not sure if it's working the way that I wanted it to. maybe I will try scattering them around her, or even change the way that that face looks by inverting it.
