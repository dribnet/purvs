This README explains the randomised faces for part3.

When distributing the parameters I tried to focus on keeping the width, height, and length variables completely random, while selectively distributing the type of face.

For example, the face, eye, and nose types have selective percentages. There is a 30% chance the face will be square, the eyes will mainly come out blue, and noses will mainly be in the "zig zag" format.

Due to the style I chose I think this was the best tactic visually. When constraining the dimensional values a lot of the features were coming out looking the same, so I decided to leave them to decide their own fate.
