I will be using quads as my main form to represent my alphabets and numbers etc. They will be made up of 4 different quads of varying shapes and sizes, and move and rotate around to change form. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
