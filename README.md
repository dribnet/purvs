## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme - Nostalgia

I changed the first photo instead of the first landscape one. So I am not focusing on looking back but about escape from reality. I think nostalgia is about you can't persuade yourself you have to live in the moment. Thus, this series photo is talking about escape from reality.
