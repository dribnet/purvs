GRID EXPERIMENT 2

For my second experiment, I decided to make my grid formatting look more interesting. Firstly, I decreased the size of the grid squares, so that more details were visible, and began my experimentation with the addition of const x_step and const y_step. I started with my nested for loop drawing squares, with my x_step and y_step variables equally separating my squares across the grid. While it did look better, I wanted to play with the variables further, and had my x_step be equal to the squares so that my image had horizontal stripes. I really liked this effect, and decided to play with the shape further.

For my second photo, I changed the squares to ellipses, and increased the x_step value, so that the horizontal stripes were more visible. I also really liked this effect, due to the background being more visible, thus breaking up the image without omitting any important details too much. With this discovery, I was excited to see how I could push this further.

For my third photo, I was interested to start playing with fill, as I was interested in possibly playing with fill to differentiate between masks. I set my fill to the background colour, and left the stroke as is. I also really enjoyed this effect, however, I was curious to see how the image would look if the shape was changed back to a square, since the squares captured more detail. Changing my ellipses back to squares was very effective, and I liked how much detail was still visible despite having a black fill.

For further development, I am interested in looking at fills for my masks, as I feel that this will further help me in having the Kaka stand out/be accentuated more in my photo set.
