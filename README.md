## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have decided to 'scrap' my previous idea, as I appear to have accidentally created a slightly blurry look that I really like.
As most of my photos deal with light I have decided that I'm going to embrace the softer more impressionistic look that I have stumbled upon.
I am still working on separating the sky from the land and sea using the masks.

I have chosen my final photo, also taken over Queen's birthday weekend, looking out over the beach towards Stevenson Island on a rainy day. I chose this photo because I like the contrast of the golden sand, the teal sea and the black/grey sky and rocks/islands.
I also like how different the photo is from the other two images, so I have placed it as my second input so that it shows in between the two warmer photos taken at sunset
