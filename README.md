I wanted to play around with the colour, stroke and transparency. For this design I changed made it black and white. I like the simplicity of that colour scheme and I think it works well with transparency.  I made the stroke width smaller, I like it like this because it makes the letters look less crowed and more delicate. I only put a stroke around the smaller circle to make it stand out a little and to make the line match better with the rest of the letter.

The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
