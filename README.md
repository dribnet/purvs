## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have decided that i like the flowers so going with that nature theme. I have been playing around with the code and found that i like this look. It almost looks as if its cross-stitch. I like how making the flower elements bigger and spaced out in comparrsion to the backgraound gives some type of depth which is compelling to look at.

Note: This is incorrect code! After i had made this i was messing around and changing the code more and accidently quit before reverting back to this styles code for the commit. I will experiment later to get it.
