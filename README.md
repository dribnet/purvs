## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My theme is the wellington wall painting art.

It is a test for my work.  I making a clolr change in my code to see how it looks like.
I use the regular pattern of small rectangle and circle to make the whole picture. Making the pictures into a pixel game style.

Here is a test of the pixle image. I plan to change all the original picture to one painting style to make them into a pixle gamea style work.
