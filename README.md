## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

THEME

The Theme for these photos is stereotyping/Image how people can feel about their image and what others see.

1st Image, this image is a representation of how every day we look at reflections, surrounded by how we look and it's always haunting us, thinking that people will always judge how we look etc The girl is looking at herself and screaming because she isn't happy with her image.

2nd Image, the flowers/plants in the image symbolise life (people) on social media surrounding her, see people post perfect pictures and share their happy memories. She is submerged with water so nearly drowning with all the unrealistic social media that she sees wishing she looked like the influencers she saw etc.


3rd Image, a lot of people feel like they cant be themselves whether its what the wear, act, look, society etc. She feels like shes trapped under/behind a mask or a wall and this image represents her breaking through to be who she wants to be.
