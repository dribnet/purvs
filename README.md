## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

DESIGN FEEDBACK

I have been playing around with the colours of the background, I have desaturated it so that the girl is clear and highlighted. I like the look but I still want to experiment with adding some colour back into it so its not so bold to see what that may look like I'm just not sure how to do that.

My mask is detailed so that I can separate the girl, hair, background and add in faces. I have layered my code so that it looks cleaner and more structured. The faces go from sad to meh to happy to show that transition of my theme. I have used a mixture of sharp shapes and soft shapes for the contrast between my theme, the background is made up of triangles to represent a shard of a mirror, and the soft shapes like curves and ellipses have been used for the girl to show that shes delicate/vulnerable.
