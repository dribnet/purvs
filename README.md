## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I have been working on cleaning up my code and have finally got the animation to work without have the weird grid lines. I have currently got the animation for the zoomed out parts (0 and 1) to be randomised, so that they look kind of like they are twinkling, which is a cool effect when there are lots of smaller shapes (rather than zoomed in). I have the pulsing animation for the close up views, as I want this section to highlight the unique shapes that can be formed when overlapping the ellipses. I have yet to complete all of the zoom layers, as I have focused on getting the animation to work, but will use code from my earlier commits to finish this.
