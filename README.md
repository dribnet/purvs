This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 
Here I am working on the hair, I have nearly finished, but I thought I would show you how I map it out. I am using beginShape() and endShape(), but instead of using vertex(x,y) I am using curveVertex(x,y) which allows for the curves you see here, and unlike a normal bezier allows me to control the fill pretty exactly, which is what I need here so that I can have those nice reverse curves. At the moment it is hard coded, if I get time later I can always map it to a scale for length or something like that.
In terms of colours, I originally chose the red bows and cheeks as place fillers, but I honestly think they are the best choices. The red bows are very cute on the normal face, and a horrific contrast on the creepy doll. Maybe I will paramatise these if this design gets through to a later stage, but for not I am happy with my choices of colour for everything except the background. If I get time it might be worth playing with paramatising the hair colour too
My second face idea has not changed

I have formatted my code and it is much easier to read and follow now.

I am thinking of a line drawing cartoon style for my third drawing
