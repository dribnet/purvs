## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Concept Work:
This alphabet is made out of twotransparent arcs, which create the approximate form of english letters where they overlap. The bluish arc sits to the left and top, and the red to the right and bottom, in that order of priority. As it stands, this totals 10 parameters per letter.

Move out of sketch.js.

Transferred sketch data into draw_letters.js and letters.js. Rescaled and positioned existing letters appropriately.


6/5/20b
More letters.

D, E, F, G, H, I, and J have been made. I'm not sure how far I'll be able to take just two arcs, but I'm gonna run as far as it'll go. Not so sure about G or F, but they exist.


1/05/20
More letters, default changed. README fixed.

K, X, and Y have been added. Not super sure about K or Y, but at least I have them. Default is now two semicircular arcs which do not overlap. Tweaked F to fit newly added rule that red should have more weight to the right and bottom. Cut out and replaced default readme.
