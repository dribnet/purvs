Here I was playing with using both a grid and tile method to determine one segment of the mask(gravestone) and then using the original random method to determie the other segment of the image (death). I quite lie the ffect of this because using the random to represent the life rather then a grid gives a nice sort of organic chaos to the leaves, whereas the more structured grid technique creates that cleaner hard edged look I wanted for death.
