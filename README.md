## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have managed to control the length of the line by preventing points that are to far away from one another from connecting. This kinda ruins the constellation effect i was producing, as they just become short squiggly lines. 

The effect is interesting but doesnâ€™t have much impact i feel. The image produced also feels and looks flat. 

In my next iteration I hope to get some dimension into the image.
