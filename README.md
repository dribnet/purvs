## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I cleaned up one of the masks to see how it looked. I think it looks a lot nicer and the transitions being a lot more accurate creates a lot more detail. 

I've taken images from a recent visit to the Auckland Botanical Gardens, this place is very special to me. I absolutely love nature and landscapes. I feel that after the long amount of time we all spent indoors, it's nice to remember just how peaceful and beautiful our planet really is.
