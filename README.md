### Outrageous clock

The first idea I have for my clock will include day and night cycles, changing to a lighter colour during PM hours and will eventually fade to a darker colour as it turns to AM. As you can see in the image above, boxes will be selected for both hours and minutes. So far I want to have a sun for PM hours and a moon for AM hours, but the amount of numbers for the minutes section underneathe the clock will be too great. Therefor I am experimenting with different ideas to solve this probelm (Maybe it only displays the current time instead).
