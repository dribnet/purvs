## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

In my example, I want to take elements from ps3 and bring them into this one. I intend to make these curved star shaped objects, and place them on the infinitite map using noise as a way to place them. 
When zoomed into, the triangles from my last project will appear. As they are zoomed into further, a texture will start to emerge, similar to seeing the atoms of an object, for example.

## Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
## preview.png (960x500) and thumbnail.png (230x120).
