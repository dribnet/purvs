Part 2: Designing the Alphabet - Start of creation and initial ideas

I've started making making actual alphabet design which is created using line. I've added a stroke cap so that it is sharp around the corners instead of the default curved ends. So far I am happy with how it looks, but I'll decide for sure if I want to add more aspects in the design after completing all the letters and numbers. I used adobe colours to get ideas for colour palettes. So far I think I want to stick with the bright colours as shown in my alphabet html. I am slightly thrown off by the dark blue which I might later change, although it works well as one of the contrasting colours. I'll later test other colour options to see if they may work better. For my default key I'm choosing between & or #.

    "lineX1": X axis for line 1
