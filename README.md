## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

4/05/2020 First sketch 
Each of my letters will be composed with one circle and one arc. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the positon and size of the arc changes with each letter and is controlled by the parameters. I have started with very simpistic forms but I quite like how the curves give the letters a soft and playful design.

The six parameters per letter:
  * `width` : size of the main circle
  * `height` : size of the main circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the arc in relation to the circle 
  * `offsety` : y offset of the arc in relation to the circle
  * `angleStart` : angle to start the arc
  * `angleStop` : angle to finish the arc
