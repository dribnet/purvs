### Color Glyphs

I have been working on my glyph system to make it more visually effective. I have changed the rotation so that it is more dramatic and I have also allowed the inner circle to become bigger. I think this makes it look even more like a flower shape. I like the contrast that this causes and also the contrast that the inverse colours cause. I think this makes the images look a lot more effective and you can make out the shapes more clearly which is good. 

I am happy with my glyph system since you can make out the images a lot more clearly than before when I didn't have the background circle which has helped. I also think that the increased rotation and larger circle size change makes the gradient more effective also.
