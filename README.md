## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I fixed the size of the letters, alphabet is done. 
I always have question about upload, every time I hit git command -a it will create a new ps2.
I don't know how to fix it, so I can only upload my staff in class.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
