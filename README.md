FINAL:

This has been a pretty challenging problem set for me and significantly harder than the previous 3 projects but I am happy that I have executed my idea from start to finish. 

My final parameterised map explores the idea of a snowflake and the very specific detail each one had. From the beginning I wanted to work with zooming and adding in little detail every time to final produce a really detailed snowflake at the final zoom. I also wanted to work with randomising the snowflake as no 2 are the same.

I ran into problems with randomising the snowflake when a code I transferred into p5 didn't quite work this problem set. I had to finalise a snow flake that varies in size and shape but overall I would've like a little more detail and randomising in the final iteration. 

I wanted to add in animation but found it didn't quite work with my problem set. The overall animation was very slow and didn't look very good which is why I chose to go without. I would've loved to have made an animation that faded out the snowflake but again was not able to do so.

Overall I am happy with my final outcome and love the zooming effect of revealing new detail which was what I wanted to achieve from the start.
