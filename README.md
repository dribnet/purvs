Block Alphabet

<<<<<<< HEAD
This code is just my 'A'. 'B', and 'C' drawn out because I haven't figured out how to use the correct code yet, but this shows what I am trying to achieve.
=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].
>>>>>>> upstream/part2

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
