## Smart Mask

I found the smart mask to not be the best. it tends to curve off before the bottom, creating an effect that makes it looks like my subjects are cut off slightly. Due to the nature of my masking where I only need to mask a single subject, the time taken to create the mask was actually longer with the smart mask than for me to loas the image into photoshop and create my own mask

My roommates and their walls are quite interesting. Each of them has similar but distinct tastes whcih creates a really interesting visual when compared. I wanted to focus on a theme of familiar but unfamiliar. The roommates themselves are easy to spot and visialise and they are on the edge of recognision, but there are small parts within that break the possibility of complete familiarity. 

The backgrounds are hard to tell with the spaes only being outlines and the colours being quite spread out. THhe gradient of size creates an almost steam effect where the squares almost look to rise up from the bottom, growing in size and density as it does so.
