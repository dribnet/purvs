## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I have just started to customize sketch.js and get an understanding of the codebase and how to change the letters. I was a little confused at first but I am starting to get the hang of it.

I really liked the example of the pixel text in 'Type me, Type me not'. I found it very interesting and it makes me want to have a think about how I could create an unique twist on the idea of a pixelated font. Maybe I could do something that 'falls' down when I type it.
