For now i have dropped the BLUR filter as it is causing too many issues with loading and not working. this is my chosen alphabet design
<<<<<<< HEAD

I have added my intrapolation fucntion to my alphabet and it is working, although since i have removed extra variables from some letters when they werent needed the animations are not smooth and look jumpy with different lines just randomly appearing i will need to fix this.
