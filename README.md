## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

 Today I figured out how to use editor and starting to create alphabets. Though I have finished designing all of the alphabets, I heaven't think about the design of the numbers.

I have also finished the looks of sketch.

 The alphabets that I have created were still using the defult colors, that is because I heaven't start designing the final look of the alphabets. I will keep adding details once I finished all of the letters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
