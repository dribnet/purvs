## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

In this project, I wanted to design an alphabet that still resembled the original alphabet but also involved paper cutting/or folding in some way.
But unlike origami, my design incorporates cut paper as well as folding, whereas origami doesn't include much paper cutting.

In my sketches and ideas on paper, I wanted to highlight the aspect of folds among paper. With the fold of paper contrasting with the shape of the letter, this sets up an aesthetically pleasing design that represents the intended letter. After looking at past projects I had found no one had taken the same angle I have with paper most likely due to the increase in parameter limit. But taking influence from last year I had realised that colour is a vital aspect that can influence my letters.
Like in origami, colour is vital to my aesthetic in my design. In origami, usually, colour paper with a white back is used. So I experimented with bright colour palettes to highlight this.

My design went through many challenges, but I had followed my original sketch through to final development. With deadlines due I had to plan my project very differently compared to other students. What I did, was to speed up my concept development so that it could be completed and implemented with the parameter limit and finished it early. This meant that I had followed my initial idea which got very difficult with some letters/numbers. But in saying that I am extremely happy that I got my alphabet done.


I started my sketch with my 12 parameter limit, but with the increased limit I developed my alphabet to include two shapes, one a beginning shape with a max of 14 vertices and just a triangle totalling 20 vertices all up. Having issues with my editor I had to manually hard code the letters and all 20 parameters for each letter, So a lot of effort went into this. I have had to play and experiment with the look of my triangle to represent paper that's been folded. The drawn shape is supposed to be an indication of the letter. The triangle helps me deal with the negative space of letters. With this combination, I was able to achieve what I wanted in terms of shape and aesthetic.

All up the interpolation is good but speeding up the rate in which it transitions gave it a better feel and look. All up seeing I had 3 hand ins on Friday and Thursday I am happy with my result and project.


The twenty parameters per letter:
  * "posx1": position of posx1 X co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
  * "posx2": position of posx2 X co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
  * "posx3": position of posx3 X co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
  * "posx4": position of posx4 X co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
  * "posx5": position of posx5 X co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
  * "posx6": position of posx6 X co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
  * "posx7": position of posx7 X co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
  
 * "triposx1": position of triposx1 X co ordinate that makes up my triangle.
 * "triposx2": position of triposx2 X co ordinate that makes up my triangle.
 * "triposx3": position of triposx3 X co ordinate that makes up my triangle.

 * "posy1": position of posy1 Y co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
 * "posy2": position of posy2 Y co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
 * "posy3": position of posy3 Y co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
 * "posy4": position of posy4 Y co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
 * "posy5": position of posy5 Y co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
 * "posy6": position of posy6 Y co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.
 * "posy7": position of posy7 Y co ordinate that makes up my draw shape.

 * "triposy1": position of triposy1 Y co ordinate that makes up my triangle.
 * "triposy2": position of triposy2 Y co ordinate that makes up my triangle.
 * "triposy3": position of triposy3 Y co ordinate that makes up my triangle.
