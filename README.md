When looking into this first part of the assignment, I was really interested in using geometric shapes to create a tiling pattern.
I've always been interested in isometric views - I'm a big fan of the game Monument Valley, which takes inspiration from M.C. Escher drawings, optical illusions, and impossible objects.

I've decided to create a cube for my tiling pattern. So far, I've just been working on figuring out all the math required to make such an object. I mucked around with drawing it using sheared and rotated rects to begin with, but this got really confusing really quickly. So, I looked up how to draw hexagons (much easier than I thought), and then set about manipulating those first 6 points of the hexagon that I drew to get the rest of the cube's perspective.

I've now slightly changed the slider controls - the first turns on/off the randomised rotation of the cubes, while the second still controls the size of the cubes.
I've also reduced the number of cubes drawn, as I feel they are quite an intricate shape, so less is more, especially as bigger cubes allow you to see the detail more easily.

When refining this design I began to think about how I could make the design easier to look at. I knew colour would make a huge difference, but the way I'd draw the cube was a bit hacky, so this didn't work as I had originally drawn them. So, I decided to spend several hours reworking how I drew the 'supporting beams' of the cube so that I could use fills and have a shape I could use colour with! It's looking great now, and I'm hoping to try out some cool combinations/randomised colour palettes when I pick up on this again tomorrow.
