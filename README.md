## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Previously, I filled out the letterforms using only the built-in rect and ellipse functions. I wasn't satisfied w/ the look so I decided to push it further by creating a custom shape using Quadratic Vertex. My options broadened as I was able to explore more interesting rotations to create more interesting letterforms. 

Using the custom shapes, I decided to explore different iterations for each letterform in Illustrator. This was helpful in realising the new letterform system before coding everything which would have been tedious b/c I tend to change my mind often.

After exploring iterations, I am starting to implement the code. I wanted to pass in the values for each vertices to create the custom shape but it was too many (21!) variables. So I decided to use 1, -1 to represent true/false. 

My current challenge is dealing with the interpolation as it is currently not satisfying. Another challenge is that the kerning is off because the letterforms are not all the same widths.
