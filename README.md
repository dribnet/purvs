## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my first post in this project, I use three kind of the images to represent that. I also use the codes from Tom White's new codes. I still do not know how to make the mask, I just replace these mask images to the white background. I will try my best to learn how to do that and finish it in the next step.
