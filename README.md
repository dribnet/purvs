## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

My font called 'nautical' is a combination of one background shape and several foreground shapes. Each letter is represented by either a square, triangle, or circle, then layered with white foreground elements using positive and negative space to form the letters.

Inspiration:
For this project, I wanted to create a fairly abstract font based on simple geometric forms. Though it was necessary for the letters to be readable, I focused more on creating creative shapes that require a little more time to read. The font style is loosely inspired by navigational and nautical themes using shapes similar to that found on a compass, lines that give a sense of directionality, and a colour scheme similar to the ocean. 


Creation:
Starting with just the background shape, I slowly added more foreground elements to the font. The triangle was the first shape I added, with parameters to change the size, position, and rotation angle. I then added the vertical and horizontal lines and experimented with another foreground circle, but ultimately decided against this as adding the circle as it didn’t fit in with the sharp navigational shape themes. Finally, I worked on the motion of the font, where the lines move into the letter from the side, the triangle rotates into place and the colour smoothly changes colour.


The parameters per letter:
  * `backgroundShapeType` : the type of the background shape (triangle, circle, sqaure)
  * `backgroundShapeRotate` : the rotation of the background shape
  * `backgroundShapeColour1` : the HEX value of green for background shape
  * `backgroundShapeColour2` : the HEX value of blue for background shape 
  * `trianglePosX` : x position of the foreground traingle
  * `trianglePosY` : y postion of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleRotate` : roation of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleSize` : size of the foreground triangle
  * `lines1VerticalXpos` : the x postion of the vertical lines
  * `lines2HorizontalYpos` : the y position of the first horizonatal lines
  * `lines3HorizontalYpos` : the y position of the second horizonatal lines
  * `linesHorizonalRotate` : the rotation of the horizonatal lines
