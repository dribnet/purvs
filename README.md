A ball animation where the ball follows a trajectory set by the user using the sliders, the distance is a constant set by msyself, where it moves but gradually slows down until it stops. There are 3 balls that move & leave a trail in order to create the letters. 

Initially I was calculating the equation of the line using y=mx+c but then i found that p5.js has vector methods so I changed it to use vectors(as this is much easier)
