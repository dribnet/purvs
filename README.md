## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Fixed the smothing problem I had with the interaction page, it wasnt as complex as i thought it was, and am just glad its done. 

I took inspiration from the theory of Yin and Yang, or half and half. Hence why my alphabet has a simplistic aproach, yin and yang isnt meant to be advanced or sharp. Rather smooth and flowing. I attempted to make my aplhabet by using the most distinguishable features of the letters, such as the tails for Q and P. Some letters gave me difficuly, such as the Z as I only had two elements to use and therefore made the Z that has the dash though the middle and went from there. 

Other than this I am pleased with how i did in the project and the work I have managed to produce.




The five parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  'start' : First angle for my arc
  'stop' : Second angle for my arc
