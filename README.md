## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I am working my way through the class tutorials and have started with adding a cross-hatching effect to the areas in the mask that are black. To make this effect stand out more, I went back and edited the mask to have more contrast and make more details stand out.   

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
