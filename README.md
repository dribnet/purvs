## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

The first face represents an ogre type character. This utilised in part code for the Mike Wazowski character from part1. There are slide controls for; eyebrow height, pupil size, drowziness, mouth type, and face rotation.

With the second face I was looking to create different iterations through changes in hair styles. The slide controls change; afro size, mullet length, fringe length, beard size, and mouth type.

The third face was inspired in combination by 1920's cartoon styles and the former street artist duo BMD. There are slide controls for; ear length, number of eyes, look direction, mouth size, and face orientation.
