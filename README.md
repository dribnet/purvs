In this section of the project I decided to continue my experiment withmasking from assignment one, rather than my final hand in creepy doll. I made this decision for two reasons. Firstly,  I felt that the design was simpler and stronger, a striking pattern not intended to reflect realism, but instead to play with ideas, bold colours and bright representation. Secondly, this design lent itself seamlessly to the knew breif, with a more humanoid form, and plenty of room for both faithful representation, and abstraction.

This project pushed my technical skills to the limit. I had to find a far more effiecient way of masking, rather than iterating through and testing two arrays of pixels per pattern, as my original method did. I may have heard this idea mentioned in passing, I honestly don't remember, but I thought what I would do would be to check the mask canvas to see what pattern, if any, should be in that pixel, and then just fetch the specific pixel from the corresponding arrays of pixels in the pattern canvases. This means that an image can contain multiple different patterns, but the array will only every need to be searched once, making the task possible.

My second technical trial came later in the piece and threw me off. The measurements withint the facemap class are all in small decimal numbers, but this does not translate to the whole pixel values needed for a graphics object and iterating through individual objects. So I had to work through and scale all the coordinates and dimensions before I could do what I had planned.

I wish I had budgetted more time. There is so much more I wanted to do. Hair colours, straight and curly hair, galaxy patterns in the eyes. Most important of all I still needed to do the training exercise but, with how behind I have fallen, and how slow my code runds, there is no way that is possible now. I have included screanshots of the way I imagine my chosen images may have looked if I had had the time to teach the computer to recognise them properly.
In all honesty, even if I had the time, I don't think my computer is up to it, just getting the screenshots was a major mission, each slider took a minimum of half a minute to update on my machine, and that is if it didn't crash, I had to reload my browser every image, and it went pretty slow even without the ma. No excuses, I ran out of time, but even if I hadn't, I would have been in trouble

There are differences in skin colour. Hair density, size and curl diameter. flower density. flower colours. And of course the coordinates of the face.
