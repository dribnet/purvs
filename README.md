I want to make one kind of letter that suitable for girls. My design have bright color and shape edge. I want girls' letter can cool and pretty at the sometime.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
