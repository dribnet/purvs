## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have started putting in my own input images and changing the mask to work with the new images. I am finding the project pretty easy to understand at this point and am excited to get more into changing the code and seeing how that changes the render. Unfortunately at this stage the thumbnail and preview will not display correctly 

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. In this image, I have used the mask to highlight the cow in the middle of the image.
