### Maeda Clock

I decided to recreate the the 5th clock from Maedas 12 clocks. I decided to not do the static image and make it a working clock,
because I thought that would be fun to do instead. In terms of changes made to the clock, I have added the functionality to hide 
parts of the clock so that you can have a clearer view of certain times you are interested in. This was because I noticed that the 
original design made it a bit harder to see something like the hours number was because it is being obscured by the other "hands".
I also quickly added a small animated circle which expands when you click on screen. This was just so it may make it easier to 
located the mouse and see where you clicked.
