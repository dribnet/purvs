I added all the main features to the face that I wanted to, including the hair. I only did the fringe/ bangs as I am focusing on the face, not the entire head. The face shape and facial features are all sharp to relfect the anime style of face I am going for. I also tested adding in a custom face with landmarks. Its kind of difficult to find images with a relevant context for my face. But since it is a fighting based anime, I figured real life images of people doing physical activities would be relevant enough.
