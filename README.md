PART 3: LAYERING DETAILS

Following on from my sketch in part 1, as well as my work in PS3, I have tried to use print10 to create an abstract view of a night time city block (think of the really grid like Manhatten).

I used stroke transparancy as well as a deep midnight blue to try to create the glow effect and overall night-time feel.

I tried to think about what our cities might look like in the future. For example, would they look and feel completely inorganic - a block within a block within a block.

 I've also tried to incorporate the way streets turn into these base block geometric elements when you zoom right in on something like google maps.

CONT. 

In part 3 I have removed the stroke transparency and tried to bring a bit more clarity back to the city grid appearance. Now, the black in between the blocks looks like large main highways. Unfortunately, the rest of the grids begin to make less sense now, therefore further iteration is needed.

CONT...

I have added back in the stroke transparency to give the glow effect of city lights. I've also made further adjustments to create more distinct city grids by reducing the noise. That being said, I decided to leave some noise in there so that there was some variance between the different blocks. 

Zooming in creates mini city blocks within the larger one, and this feeds back into the idea of the block within a block concept I mentioned at the start.

The grid is lost once the zoom has reached a certain level, around 5 or 6, and loses context, but I'm not sure that the abstraction is such an issue. I would like to see what it will look like once landmarks are added in.
