This is an updated version of my first experiment. I don't know if I want this to be my final concept as its very simple but I used it to get to know what I need to be doing in this assignment. 
Each letter has six fixed dots which can have lines between them to make different letters. I made nine (added two for diagonal lines) parameters, that function like booleans (1 for true, 0 for false), to tell decide whether a letter needs a line between two of the dots. The drawLetter function then runs if statements to test whether each parameter is true and then draws a line between the points if it is true.

The parameters are:

p1p2: Between top left and top right
p3p4: Between mid left and mid right
p5p6: Between bottom left and bottom right
p1p3: Between top left and mid left
p2p4: Between top right and mid right
p3p6: Between mid left and bottom left
p4p6: Between mid right and bottom right

p1p6: Between top left and bottom right
p2p5: Between top right and bottom left

I think this font looks pretty cool but its super basic so I'd quite like to push myself a bit more so I am going to play around with a font made out of shapes like my second experiment. 
=======
Each letter in this experiment is made out of two layers of circles. The back (orange) ones make up the shape of the letter while the front (white) ones act as the 'negative space' usually in the letters. I don't think this is a super effective font when it comes to move complex characters but it was fun to play around with shapes and I like the look of it. I used loops to draw the number of circles on each layer and change their alignment.

I used the parameters:
 * `backTriCount`: number of triangles in the back layer
 * `frontTriCount`: number of triangles in the front layer
 * `frontAlign`: how much to move the front layer of circles on the x axis
