### Tree Of Growth Main

This is the final form of my project. Ive got the alarm working how I want, a nice day/night cycle, and a lone cloud floating by.

My project is a standard rotation clock however in place of hands, trees grow. They reset on each minute hour and day to slowly regrow. They are set on their own little world, a stark difference to the initial starting idea of three rows for the trees.
