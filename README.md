## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


Part 3:
I add the "cross" shape in my glyth:
	The cross patter: a square at the back, a cross shape inside the square with dark red (strong and impact color) and a "V" letter (represent violence) in the middle.
This shape will be applied on the black area of the mask. It means people can be suppress by the "Violence" (the eyes or mouths are covered), the way to against the "Violence" is to be brave enough and break the "cross". It's zero tolerate to violence (such as family violence) and people need to expose it bravely. The image in the middle (input 2) represent some people may not be the victim of violence but they also need to stop violence (or bullying) resolutely.

Part 2:
My theme is "Against Violence". I add three photos that I took and start to experiment them with grid layout techniques.

Part 1:
I fix the bug and added three random photos that I took. I got some idea: 

1, Cats Protect League
2, Artwork/gallery in wellington
3, Family Violence

But have not decide which one to go for.
