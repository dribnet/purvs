## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - AGING

Final Design - Aging Treasure

The final design for my custom pixel can be seen above.

~ Pixel Description

The design above uses images of my sister when she was a baby, my sister in present time, and also my mum in present time. Through these photos, they depict different age ranges and generation I want to convey through the theme of aging. The mask controls the texture of "vintage look" and the creases you'd see over time.

~ Process Summary

Initially I explored different ideas, starting of with my theme being Neo-Tokyo night life. However, running this theme through with my lecturer, I decided to change my images and theme to a somewhat more personal message.  Aging is a natural, beautiful and inevitable process during everyone's life, and through this theme, I wanted to convey the treasury of aging. I controlled the size of the width and height tile constant, due to wanting the image look more crisp and clearer--to have a clear insight of the significance of these images.

In conclusion, the result creates interesting images with the mask working together to create a unique piece for each portrait. My last output being my mum shows a mask with more creases and white scratches compared to the other two, as this shows the "aging" and the older generation--like a photo that has been through a lot since it has been taken.

Although, I believe I could have pushed the outcome a lot more with options like adding vignettes and ornaments around the images to further convey the message of aging treasure, however with due date restrictions and timing, I was not able to.
