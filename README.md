## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today, I've had a discovery about creating my theme more coherent. I will consider changing my input_3 image because despite having different flowers doesn't have the same top view and I think for it to work better as a theme they should all be view from the top

I also need to remember that these images are being displayed on a billboard. As much as I can go into tiny little details, this image will be blown up and could be seen much further away from myself to my computer screen. Keeping it simple but using the masks and the codes more effectively

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
