### Helix clock. 

Final:

This is my final design, which i called the Helix clock. It shows the speed of the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. I changed my idea a lot but i stuck with this at the end as i thought it was my strongest design. It is very simple but effective. 
I wanted the main focus to be on the helix waves hence why the made the background black. 
When the alarm sets off, the ellipses’ grow in size and also changes in colour. I changed the colour onto yellow and green as i wanted it to really stand out and to be somewhat in-your-face. The outcome of the alarm was really good a portrayed the feeling of an alarm going off. 
I came across a lot of obstacles during this project and it made it harder that t i couldn’t decide on one idea. But as i looked at all my deigns and sketches, the Helix Clock stood out to me the most. 
I disregarded the idea of actually showing the time in my clock and just to show the speed of time. 
Im happy with how my clock turned out. Its a very simple deisgn but effective design to show the speed of time. 


Second Sketch:

I disregard the domino idea and decided to go for a more simple idea. I started of with a simple wave that goes down the page to represent the speed of the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. I had another idea to instead create a helix shape with the waves. It looks a lot more interesting then just one simple wave. The helix shape kind of reminds me of the shape of a DNA. I will keep the background black just so that any colour i pick for my helix, it will also stand out. 

Maede clock:

the maeda clock i picked was the pixellated numbers and the hours and minutes alternated as they zoomed in and out. This clock stood out to me as it was so simple but the design was so effective. If i have time, i want to try and make it functional.  

Original clock:

this is my hellix clock. I was inspired by the sine wave that i saw on P5.JS but for some reason it wasn’t working when i tried putting it in my code. I found a website https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/changes-over-time/ where i was able to find a similar sine wave that i was able to incorporate into my code. It was really helpful and helped me get started on my helix wave. Originally it was just one sine wave represent the hours, minutes, second and milliseconds but i decided to put two sine waves and turn it into a helix clock which looked more interesting. i had to play around with the values a lot to get it exactly how  wanted it to. I really like the colours i picked out, it goes from blue to pink
