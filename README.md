My letters are made up of two circles and a line. The first circle has a fixed size and postion. Where as with the other two shapes (the second circle and line) the location and size are controlled by parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `x1` : starting x position of the line
  * `y1` : starting y position of the line
  * `x2` : ending x position of the line
  * `y2` : ending y position of the line
