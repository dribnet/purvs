## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of books I have read. The masks for each photo highlight various objects.

I have added a grey mask into my code, so I can make the objects which are on top of each other a bit different, so they will stand out more. I have made the grey mask an ellipse and the white mask a star. I then played around with the background. what I found worked best was the use of rectangles. I then played out with the sizing of the rectangles to get the best look for my theme.
