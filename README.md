### 01/04/22 - STARTING THE ALPHABET

In yesterday's class, I imported the code from my ABC code into the code for the rest of the alphabet. I adjusted some of the values in each of the variables so that they would fit within the bounding boxes. I now need to start creating the rest of my letters for the alphabet. At this point I think I am going to continue with my Mondrian style letters, unless I have a brainwave for any new ideas. I will do some research into the style to learn more about the proportions and colours so that I can make it true to style.

The 11 parameters per letter:
  * `squareX` : x offset of the red square
  * `squareY` : y offset of the red square
  * `squareSize` : the length of the sides of the red square
  * `rectX` : x offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectY` : y offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectWidth` : width of the blue rectangle
  * `rectHeight` : height of the blue rectangle
  * `lineX` : x offset of the start point of the line
  * `lineY` : y offset of the start point of the line
  * `lineLength` : length of the line
  * `lineAngle` : orientation of the line (either vertical or horizontal)

My next step will be to set up the editor file to make it easier to create new letters.
