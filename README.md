## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Decided to as of now go with a basic black and white colour scheme as my font is quite sharp and I was to accentuate this. I also added a space character and a question mark character, and changed the speed of my exhibition so that there's less of a wait between word changes. 

The twelve parameters per letter are:
  * `x` : x co-ordinate of first point of line segment
  * `y` : Y co-ordinate of first point of line segment
  * `x2` : x co-ordinate of second point of line segment
  * `y2` : Y co-ordinate of second point of line segment
  * `x3` : x co-ordinate of third point of line segment
  * `y3` : Y co-ordinate of third point of line segment
  * `x4` : x co-ordinate of fourth point of line segment
  * `y4` : Y co-ordinate of fourth point of line segment
  * `x5` : x co-ordinate of first point of individual line
  * `y5` : Y co-ordinate of first point of individual line
  * `x6` : x co-ordinate of second point of individual line
  * `y6` : Y co-ordinate of second point of individual line
