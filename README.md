--Wallpaper--
The wallpaper uses simple rects and lines
to create a detailed pattern.

The color scheme is neon and bright,
taking inspiration from future japanese night lighting. The goal of this wallpaper
is to create an aesthetically pleasing composition using simple shapes to create
a complex pattern.

--Landscape--

This is the start of an ocean landscape. I was planning on using the pretty glowing
shapes as a 'bubble' effect for the ocean. However I don't intend on using this idea
to continue at the moment, as I feel I could go in a more original direction.
