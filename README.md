## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Update 3

Before moving forward with editing the code, I wanted to quickly explore whether adding a human painting, growing and showing action to give works a clearer narrative. 

To do so I created 3 new masks made up of 3 silhouttes, the first a child painting reaching up with a brush, the second a teenager with spray cas, the final an adult on top of a ladder sitting and tightly using a brush. These forms didn't appear as the ellipse and rectangle were indistinguishable from each other so I simply halved the rectange input just to get an idea of them as an addition.
