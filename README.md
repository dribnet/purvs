PARAMETERS FOR FACES;

Today I have finished working on my parameters for the different faces. I will probably tweak them and refine the overall look of the faces tomorrow but basically these will be my final parameters.
For Face 1 (Panda): 
Continuous: size/scale of face, mouth curve, eye patch size
Discrete: ear type, cheek/blush type
For Face 2 (Brown Bear):
Continuous: size/scale of face, mouth curve, mouth size
Discrete: ear type, eye patch type
For Face 3:
Continious: size/scale of face, mouth curve, mouth size
Discrete: ear type, eye type

So far I think the faces are developing well from what my original idea was but I want to refine how they look more and think of an interesting arrangement as well as just overall adjustments before handin and presentations.
