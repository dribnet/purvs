## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


Each of my letters is composed with two triangles and one rectangle The size of the 3 shapes is controlled by sixteen parameters.

The sixteen parameters per letter:
  * triX1: first x point for peach triangle
  * triY1: first y point for peach triangle
  * triX2: second x point for peach triangle
  * triY2: second y point for peach triangle
  * triX3: third x point for peach triangle
  * triY3: third y point for purple triangle
  * ptX1: first x point for pink triangle
  * ptY1: first y point for pink triangle
  * ptX2: second x point for pink triangle
  * ptY2: second y point for pink triangle
  * ptX3: third x point for pink triangle
  * ptY3: third y point for pink triangle
  * rectL: length of rectangle
  * rectW: width of rectangle
  * rectX: x point of rectangle
  * rectY: y point of rectangle


04052020 For today we were working n the sketch.js. For this I played around with an idea I had for my design, which was using ovals. So I changed the pramters of the circles to fit the idea of having them as ovals. I then changed the colours of the two ovals, and of the background. I also added a Thicker stroke weight arounf the ovals to help make them stand out more.

08052020 Having donr the ovals, in the sketch.js, I found I didn't really like it as much as I thought I would, so I started to play around with using triangles instead. So I started with playing around with this idea. Though with using 2 triangles, I found I couldn't see how I was goig to do some of the number and letters, so i decded to add in a rectangle, so I would be able to achieve this

11052020  With having now come up with my idea , I couldnt figure out how to do the triagles. When I tried to do them it would just keep coming up with lines instead of a triangle. So after asking for help on slack, I was able to make the triangle. After getting the help I was able to move along and get the second triangle done as well. When trying to figure thisout I was doing it in the sketch.js.

11052020 Having now figured out how to do the triangles, I started to move on an do the draw letter code. After watching the viedos on blackboard I was able to start on the alphabet.. This was hardr than it hought, as i was having to figure out the point for each of my three shapes.  For my alphabet I have 3 shapes - 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, with these three shapes I was able to do all the letter and the numbers. In total I have sixteen parameters, I tried to see where I could cut down, but with triangles having six each, I found I wasn't able to.

13052020 Today I was able to finish to off the alphabet, and strated to play around with the colours, though I'm thinking I might change the colours again.

16052020 Today I did interpolation. At first i thought this was going to be hard, but wth watching the viedo found it was easy. After I had it running without any bugs, the letters and numbers would tranistion smoothly between each other.

17052020 After having done the code side of it all, I started to play around with the colours. I found the clours I had chosen didn't really work the way I wanted them to. So now I have gone for more watermelon colours. I also made it that there was no stroke as I found the stoke runied the letters.

20052020 With having finished most of my code, I asked for some feedback regrading my design. The feedback I was given was to make that thee was a space around the rectangle so it would constant for each of my letters and my numbers. How I did this was by making the changing the stoke weight and colour for the rectangle. I increased the stroke weight to 4, and made the stoke colour the same as the background.

21052020 Today I have gone through my code changing some of the names of the variables, and making sure the comments on my code match my code and not the one I strated with. I also went through my readme to make sure it haa all the right details.
