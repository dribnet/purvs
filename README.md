## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So I have settled on three images that I've taken, the first is a close-up image of a bee collecting pollen that I captured recently on a photo walk for this project. The next  is a scene of a rainbow over a house near where I live. Finally I took an image of two small mushrooms that I noticed sprouting out of the ground while out walking. All of these fit into my theme of appreciation for nature. The close-ups exemplify how if we stop to examine seemingly ordinary things, we may find beautiful or unexpected objects, and in my personal experience, these moments bring me great joy. The rainbow is a simple reminder to look out your window every once in a while, and stop to appreciate things that we often don't take the time to notice, like colourful clouds at sunset/sunrise, or a rainbow after a passing shower. Moments like these, again in my personal experience, allow me time to be present, and to ground me in nature and reality - which is often something that gets ignored due to all the digital stimuli in our modern world.
