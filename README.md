Designing Alphabet Progress - 12/05/2020

This is just a progress update and where I am up to in terms of designing my letters. I have linked my parameters to the editor.js which has been helping me alot
in terms of design and generating the code (so I don't have to input and guess random numbers).   

I am currently up to the letter V, you can have a look at my preview image or thumbnail to see an example of the style I am going for.
My letters are best viewed in the editor as well because I was able to change the background colour to a dark grey which suits my lettering the most.
The opacity and negative space especially shows up when the background is this colour. If you have a look at my alphabet.js
you will see that my letters look a bit different to my ABC or editor and that's because the background light and my letters have opacity applied to them so
they became lighter instead of darker.

I will continue the alphabet and finish with the numbers too!

The 14 parameters per letter:
 • "offsetx": 17, | x position for first rect (filled)
 • "offsety": 0, | y position for first rect (filled)
 • "rectlength": 28, | first rect length
 • "rectheight": 90, | first rect height
 • "nofill_length": 20, | second rect length (no fill)
 • "nofill_height": 82, | second rect height (no fill)
 • "rect_twoposx": 55,  | x position for second rect
 • "rect_twoposy": 4, | y position for second rect
 • "triangleleftx": 188, | tri first point x
 • "trianglelefty": 270, | tri first point y
 • "triangletopx": 228, | tri secong point x
 • "triangletopy": 198, | tri second point y
 • "trianglerightx": 266, | tri third point x
 • "trianglerighty": 270, | tri third point y
