## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For some odd reason my index file won't render what coded for my picture. It may be because I amped up the number of pixels it was going to render but it doesn't seem to want to do that either.

I've decided I'm going to stick with my crafts theme and create a cross-stitch and embroidery like custom pixel. The main area being the crosses you see and then the smaller, highlighted areas would be where vertical "embroidery" stitches would be.
