This is my first attempt at the letters A B C D E F
I have experimented with triangles and lines.
As i said throughout my sketch experimenting, i knew it would take a bit of time to get through each letter, which i was definitely correct about.
However i am enjoying exploring the different sizes and point movements i can create.
I am getting the hand of it more by understanding what each variable change does the more I do it.
