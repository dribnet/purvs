## PS1 MDDN 342 2017



I have brought the code from my last project across to start getting everything together for ps2. 

I am going to continue with the idea around monsters but I want to edit it to make it slightly more detailed with more shape. I am going to alter the colour scheme to be more controlled and refined and use photos of well known dictators to generate the images as I think putting a silly face over these is interesting and brings a bit more of a theme to my work.
