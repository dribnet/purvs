### Final Clock

My final clock is an emotional clock demonstrating the emotions of an average human throughout the day. To display this I have used emoji's in the middle of the clock. My idea is based on the circadian clock but is a more playful spin on this. Something I added was the change of the background when the emoji is sleeping to make it more obvious that it is night time. I also decided to add some text for my clock so that the time would be more readable. However, I made this small because I did not want it to take over the clock, as I like the idea of the emoji being the center and most important part of the clock.
