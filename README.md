## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The image shown is the result of my 'mask' generating code that essentially functions as a sort of edge detection, with white areas representing areas with higher contrast and black with less. I will be using this information to drive a turtle-based tendril visualisation.

This code was actually largely written a little bit ago, but health problems have gotten in the way of working on this a bit.

I believe this backing mask will serve my image concept of "Connectivity" well, by using the contrast areas for chance of tendril splitting.


---

#### Changes:

- Made the edge detection a bit more sophisticated and sanitised the result a bit

#### Issues:

- Parameters might need tweaking for different images but that's okay

- Tendril split chance will probably need a reasonable base chance with this

#### To-Do:

- Implement the tendril component

#### Notes:

- Delta Map came out better than I expected really
