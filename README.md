## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters contains circles and arcs. The arc size and position is fixed, but the angle is affected by parameters. The circles can change their position.

The parameters in my program are:
  * `offset1x` : x offset of the first circle relative to the arc
  * `offset1y` : y offset of the first circle relative to the arc
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the arc
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the arc
  * `arcStart` : starting angle of the arc (degrees)
  * `arcEnd` : ending angle of the arc (degrees)

  At this point my program uses 6 parameters.

Setting up

I have chosen a colour palette along with a rough arrangement. Further details above.

I have finished of the alphabet. I began by sketching each letter, and then bringing them into the program. Some letters looked different once in the program so I made small changes for some of them. I also eliminated one of the parameters by making each of the circles the same size for each letter.
