## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I am making my alphabet out of an arc and a triangle. I like the slightly abstracted look that it gives and I think I'll continue with this concept. 

I had already planned potential concepts in advance, so the only challenge I had was figuring out the code. 

The parameters per letter:
  offsetx - the x offset of the letter components
  offsety - the y offset of the letter components
  triangleX1 - first x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY1 - first y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX2 - second x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY2 - second y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX3 - third x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY3 - third y co-ordinate of the triangle
  arcSizeX - arc length on the x axis
  arcSizeY - arc length on the y axis
  arcStart - beginning of the arc in degrees
  arcEnd - end of the arc in degrees
