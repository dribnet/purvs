## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

May 16 2020

I did a sketch with an idea of what I want to go for my letters. I drew my inspiration from mathematic symbols, mainly derived from the division symbol. My basic shapes will be lines and ellipses. I found it a bit difficult to work under 12 variables but that is what I love about this challenge!

Here is my sketch: https://prnt.sc/shrcc5

However, the letters may change.
 I finally opened up the intimidating draw_letters.js and letter.js, and I found it quite difficult trying to get things to show up on alphabet and encountered a few errors! But after a few tries I managed to get stuff to show up. I did A and B which were quite easy since I completed it in the sketch, however C was very difficult. However, I managed to get an idea done for C and from experimenting I managed to get a few parameters for other letters that I had planned to do. 

I will be doing things such as the colours later, but I just wanted something done in my code for the weekend.

I worked on a few letters and managed to get the editor working! This helped me out a lot and made things a lot easier, so i'm grateful we were able to take advantage of this for this project. Due to some limitations with my parameters, I don't think I am 100% able to go with the designs initially planned from my sketch. However, I will work around this and try to find more of a consistent pattern.
