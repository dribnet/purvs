## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme
Water cycle

I chose three image from three different weather to explain my theme. 


Elements
In this part, I was focusing on how I can define each part of my design. Also, I was thinking how I can explain my theme clearly with different elements. 

Smartmask
Because there are two parts in my input images. One of them is the sky part. Another one is the non-sky part. They are specific objects. And I checked the masking categories. It didn't mention the sky. Therefore, I didn'y use smartmask in my project.
