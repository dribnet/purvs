This is my first approach of this code.

I try to continue the art style of David Adey however I havenâ€™t figure out how to located each point of my shapes.

I only keep the same colour from my previous version, I not doing the cube shape anymore.

I use curve to draw out the heart shape and change the position. But the grid is too hard to control.
