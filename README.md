Part 3

Beginning to implement more detail appearing with the zoom.

At zoom level 2, rings appear around some planets.

At zoom level 4, the planets without rings gain a moon. I'm going to have to figure out how to randomize the position of it using the noise, and also give it some random colour also.

I'm going to try to add some comets also, along with more stars appearing in deeper zoom levels. Will possibly have to do that with another smaller grid?'
