### 03/04/22 - TOUCH UPS AND BACKGROUND CHANGES

Today, I have made a few adjustments to my design before the hand in on Thursday. I got some general feedback today and I feel pretty happy with my interpolation between the letters. I am going to keep the code for my other interpolation option just in case I change my mind between now and hand in.

I also made some changes to the canvases behind the letters. I extended the height of the canvases to make sure the letters didn't go off the edge when the interpolation occurs.

The borders around the canvases, being black, made the exhibition page look quite busy and made the letters harder to read. I had a thought that maybe instead of eight individual canvases it could be one large one. I extended my grey rectangles to make them look joined together and removed the border lines inbetween. However, I wanted to add a border around the whole edge of the canvas which was going to be tricky with the left and right edges. I added lines to the top and bottom of the canvas to make part of a border and that did look ok.

One other thing I wanted to change about this was to have one rope hanging the painting up rather than eight little ones as it would then look more realisitc. I am unsure of how I might add a single background to the exhibition page so I have changed it back to eight individual canvases but instead there is not side border, only the lines along the top and bottom, and I think this does improve the design. I also changed the colour of the border, nail and string to be a dark grey rather than black.

On top of this, I added comments to my code and tidied it up a bit.

The 15 parameters per letter:
  * `numLineSquares` : The number of squares to be drawn in the array
  * `lineSquaresX`: The x position of the square array
  * `lineSquaresY`: The y position of the square array
  * `rectYellowX`: The x position of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectYellowY`: The y position of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectYellowWidth`: The width of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectYellowHeight`: The height of the yellow rectangle
  * `rectRedX`: The x position of the red rectangle
  * `rectRedY`: The y position of the red rectangle
  * `rectRedWidth`: The width of the red rectangle
  * `rectRedHeight`: The height of the red rectangle
  * `square1X`: The x position of one of the first white squares
  * `square1Y`: The y position of the first white square
  * `square2X`: The x position of the second white square
  * `square2Y`: The y position of the second white square

My next steps are to keep touching things up and make a final decision about my interpolation and background. I feel that I am on track to finish for hand in on Thursday.
