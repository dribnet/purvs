## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've just created the bass for my letters, my idea is that in each letter there is a still rainbow, with rays shooting out from it of different colours from within the rainbow. However, the rays form different shapes/symbols to represent each letter. That is what makes each letter unique. 

Inside the preview.jpg image for this commit will be my sketch and inspiration for this idea. I'm really excited to play with this idea and see how it looks.
