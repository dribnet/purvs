## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2


Today I started on the sketch file by changing the circles into rectanges, each a different colour



Each of my letters is composed with two squares. The size and position of the first square is fixed, but the location and size of the second square is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second square
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second square relative to the first one
  * `boxColour` : the colour of the first square
