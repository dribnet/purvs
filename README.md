The concept for my alphabet is to base it on the [Aurebesh Alphabet](https://omniglot.com/images/writing/aurekbesh.gif) from the Star Wars universe.

| 13/05/2020 | Managed to get letterA to work however, my variables are starting to balloon trying to get the other shapes, and is becoming a bit of a headache to produce. I'm having to add variables for each letter and I imagine as I do the whole alphabet I would discover even more will be needed. With this in mind I will likely be changing my design to work with the arcs/triangles idea I also had hand-sketched. <br/> Switched design to arc and I'm pretty happy with how it is looking. 10 variables for now and looks fairly neat. The colours are somewhat placeholder for now; considering this a prototype scheme and will investigate something more fitting for the final design. <br/> As of this evening I have no ported my sketch.js into the appropriate areas, and I've slightly modified the background colour to better suit the scheme. The editor works and has provided me with my default character (for now at least).												 |
| 11/05/2020 | Initial work on sketch letters. Deciding on horizontal lines as the design I want to pursue, I have modified the draw variables to work for that.																		 |
| 10/05/2020 | Current design direction is to base the characters off the Aurebesh Alphabet from the Star Wars universe. Initial drawn sketch idea replaced.																	 |
