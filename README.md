My idea so far is to use different sized rectangles to 'cut out' holes from a large rectangle/square to form each letter. The size and position of the initial large rectangle will always be the same, but the smaller rectangles will change size and position as needed to create the illusion of 'cutting holes' where there would be in a real letter. 

I am still experimenting with this type of code, and so far I have only managed to create the A. The parameters that will determine what letter is shown (so far) are:

Parameters:
  * `size` : Of the largest rectangle that always stays the same
  * `wid` : The width of a smaller rect that will 'cut hole'
  * 'hei' : The height of a smaller rect that will 'cut hole'
  * 'offsetx' : x offset of first rect that will 'cut hole' in relation to large stationary one
  * 'offsety' : y offset of first rect that will 'cut hole' in relation to large stationary one
  * `b2offsetx` : x offset of the second rect in relation to the large stationary one
  * `b2offsety` : y offset of the second rect in relation to the large stationary one
