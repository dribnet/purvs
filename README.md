The base of my mid century modern wallpaper style is coming together. I've got singluar lines of diamonds and the next step is to vary them randomly and add different shapes in the backgroud. 

I've used translation and rotation to achieve what I've got so far and I think this is the most effective way. I initially was working with verticies but getting them into a grid loop proved pretty difficult!
