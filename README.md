## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My font name is "SwitchGame"

My idea is use 4 rectangular to show the alphabet, and i want to make it looks smooth, so i change the rectangular's 4 corners from right angle to rounded corners. And that shape is just look like a Switch, so my font theme is Switch. Afterthat, I use red, blue, dark blue and white for 5 different squares. so there are one big dark blue square at the outside, one red square and one blue square for the main part and two white small square. i choose a cream color for the back ground so it can make people forcus on the font.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
