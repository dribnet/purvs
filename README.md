## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Project updates for Karen O'Brien

Today I went into town and collected my three photos, using myself as the main subject. I'm pretty happy with how they turned out, although I might head out last minute to change a few of them slightly. Now I'm going to modify the contrast on my images to create the effect I want. 

As New Zealand recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, I want to use this project to remind Wellington of how quickly diseases can spread and the importance of social distancing. In my image series I will be using the warmest colours of bright red, orange and yellow to represent a person infected with Covid-19, contrasting with the blue shades of the background.
