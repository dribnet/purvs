## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


I have just tried to experiment with how to use the code and familiarise myself with how to use it so I just changed it to rectangles and the colours so I would not be too stuck in the example code we have been given. I really like the colours I have chosen but my next step is to do some research and look into letterforms and come up with my own ideas of how I want it to look. 
The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second rect
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rect relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rect relative to the first one
