## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I had some big issues with trying to merge the new branch, as I had no work done over the weekend I just wiped all my old work and started fresh so that I could get the new branch to work. After this I will work on making my alphabet.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
