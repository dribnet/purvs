This was a test trying to figure out how to implement triangles to form letters, and seeing what parameters I would need to make each letter. I figured making my own drawTriangle function would allow me to easily create a triangle with only an x and y rather than ust using the triangle function which takes each point of the traiangle (x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3)
