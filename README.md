Another zooming in iteration - just experimenting with what I can do with the shapes and opacity to continue on with the concept of my original wallpaper. I like how shape is a lot more interesting when zoomed in and I think I could add elements off this quite well. To me it almost looks like a lotus flower, especially when I get rid of the lower ellipses, so I may continue down an abstract flower path as a concept.
