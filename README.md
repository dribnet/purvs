Did some training and found it very hard to find the proper one. If I had more time I would go back and change some of the sliders, but it's too late now. The colour helps a lot though.

Also changed the faces a bit so they look more like the actual faces. Added in the mouth and the contours of the face to the shape, but still kept the glow effect.'
