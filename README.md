The three parameters per letter:
  * 
  * `x` : x offset of the first triangle relative to the first point
  * `y` : y offset of the first triangle relative to the first point
  * `1x` : 1x offset of the first triangle relative to the second point
  * `1y` : 1y offset of the first triangle relative to the second point
  * `2x` : 2x offset of the first triangle relative to the third point
  * `2y` : 2y offset of the first triangle relative to the third point

<<<<<<< HEAD
  * `3x` : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the first point
  * `3y` : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the first point
  * `4x` : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the second point
  * `4y` : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the second point
  * `5x` : 3x offset of the second triangle relative to the third point
  * `5y` : 3y offset of the second triangle relative to the third point

=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
