Today I finished the numbers. I tried to make them a lot "smaller" shapes than the letters so there is a way to tell them apart, but only slightly. 

Next, I will try adding my own flair to the shapes by making the numbers less perfect. At the moment the letters and numbers all use perfect halves/quaters/whole divisions of the 100x200 rectangles. By making it less perfect it will hopefully look more handmade.

Parameters:
  "pointoneX" - first vertex X
  "pointoneY": - first vertex Y
  "pointtwoX": - second vertex X
  "pointtwoY": - second vertex Y
  "pointthreeX": - third vertex X
  "pointthreeY": - third vertex Y
