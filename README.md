### Times of Life


My idea for the clock is to have a traditional clock face in the centre and then have other "clocks" on the outside exept they won't be showing the real time they will be showing how of something happens in the world e.g. how often a baby is born which is every 14 seconds. I am yet to think of an idea for an alarm, but maybe something like the clocks shaking or rattling.
