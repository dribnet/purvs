Alphabet Refined - 13/05/2020

In this update I have made the changes to letters A - D. You can have a look above. They are now smaller, less bold and fit with the rest of the other letters.

My font isn't neccessarily designed to be readable but is inspired by the forms and strokes of the english alphabet.
I didn't have a hard time coding my letters thanks to the editor :)!! but for some letters with more diangonal strokes such as X were harder to replicate
but I am happy with the outcome of every letter! you can still see hints of the original alphabet form.
