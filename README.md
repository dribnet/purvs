## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After thinking about my images and what they mean to me, I realised that although they make sense in remembering what lockdown level 4 was like, I also think they really touch on the importance of self-care and taking time for yourself.

Each image shows how you as an individual can spend your time in between our busy lives, whether that be from something such as reading a book, taking care our your plants or watching tv. It is important to do these things to help you grow.

For my final image, I am still not quite happy with how it looks and I feel as if it doesnt really fit in with the other images quite well. I have taken a screenshot of all three images together on my github to process this. I think a different effect for the orange lines might be needed to fix the issue.
