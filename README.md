## Crime Scene

The final submission:

The inspiration for this project is from Crime Scene. The main hue of those images is dark blue, mystery. What I try to display is making a crime scene appear in the viewer's mind when they look at those photos. However, this series of work is not displayed how a murderer murder someone. This is more like shows the process of a detective in solving the case. Therefore, there is a lot of elements from detective films (detective's crazy wall, lots of notes). I used different ways to treat the images.  

The story of those images is a murderer that killed someone. A detective used the clue that leaves in the scene and analysed the process of crime. Therefore, on how to treat those images, I choose to make the important clue in full resolution. 

The First image is a two goblet with wine. The murderer put a sleeping pill into the wine. One of the goblets is really clean and do not have any clues so I used squares to replace the pixel. I make the unimportant part's pixel with squares and the useful part with rectangles ( The important part: The goblet with lip print).  The most worthful clue must be the lip print so I made it on full resolution. The goblet contains wine and victim's blood so I use really thin and long lines to replace the pixels. This is in order to give viewers an uncanny feeling and I feel the sharp waves can give viewers an anxious feeling which is appropriate to the style of my images. 

The Seconds image is 'murder''s face. According to the clues that the detective found at the crime scene. The detective makes a profile of the murderer. The main hue of this image is creepy I hope viewers can feel how ferocious that the murder is. The expression in the murder's eye is ferocious. In addition, when I edit the images in PS, I used two images and collage them because it makes this photo feels like it's a profile from the detective.
The shapes that I used on the photo makes the face looks blurry. For the mouth and eye part, I use long lines to replace the pixel, the same reason as the first images. I also apply some red and short lines on the image so that increase the creepy and ferocious feeling of this image.

The third image is also the image in detective's mind. Based on the clue, he deduces the process. The muderer using sleeping pill and make the victim in sleep and kill the victim by using knife. The blood drop on the floor. There is no finger print on the knife. She is scrupulous. That is the story of this series of image. Back to how I treat this image, I make the important part in full resolution to make viewers can saw the details. Also, can feel the atmosphere of those images. 


On those three images, the background all contains a small and red ellispe. One of the reasons is to make the frame more interesting instead of only use the pixel's color. Other reason of it is I pretent those ellipses are blood drop. Because of this is about crime scene, add this element can make the frame looks a bit more bloody but not too scare.


I think this series of images present a really clear style and this series of images also present an unbridged crime story.
