## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos from a trip to Japan I went on in 2015. They all share similar colours and moods so I thought they would be good subjects for this project.

Inspired by today's lecture I tried 2 different pixels in the same image. The first is a further iteration of my experiment from yesterday, the second is using a grid of circles. This grid gives a pretty cool effect with the negative space, and I have been inspired to experiment further with the grid idea. I plan on keeping the lines for the background as it looks sort of like paint.
