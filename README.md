PART 5: FINAL

In summary of assignment 1 as a whole; I began by creating a couple of faces - squidward and gollum (he's there in the middle somewhere...). In part 2 I was able to assign all 5 parameters to gollum's face which made it the clear choice to take forward into part 3. However, with the randomise feature, gollum no longer looked like gollum - if ever he did. 
In part 4 I gave particular emphasis to the features of the eyes, namely the eye size, direction, and the brow. Through distribution I attempted to create a bias towards having a wide eyed expression that faced to the right (where squidward was in part 2).

I will now explain my changes for part 5 of assignment 1. 

Continuing on from my work in part 4 and in reference to the human histogram I decided to distribute the layout of my faces based on the direction of their eyes.

In part 4 I gave them a bias to look to the right of the screen (their left). Now, if any faces are looking to the right, they will be grouped together to the right of the screen.

Further, I experimented with increasing the number of faces and the scale. The problem with having more faces is that they are all stacked on top of each other and so it becomes less visually apparent that there is a right facing preference - the left side of the screen begins to fill with no notable difference in the number of faces on the right. 

Adjusting the scale to be any larger also affects the visual clarity of the skew.

In the end, I settled on less is more for the effective communication of my goals for part 5.
