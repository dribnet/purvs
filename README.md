## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

I played around with some of the code and i manged to get the spacing to work after a while because I was missing a line of code. I added some triangles and it turned out pretty interesting after I got it to work. I think that i will play with it more and see what I come up with. For now this is an experiment.
