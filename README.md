## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After some good feedback ive gone back to my previous idea using the grid. With this version I experimented with tidying up the look of it a bit more by drawing custom shapes in each of the squares of the grid and then applying fill to that as opposed to the entire lines. While techincally I think this is good I think I prefer the chaoticness of the other images. I think Ill explore putting the fill just back in in strips as opposed to the grid
