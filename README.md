## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After further experimentation with shape and opacity I feel I have settled at a happy medium where I am satisfied with how my outputs all look.

I have set the earth section to a slightly lower opacity than the sea, as I still wanted to be able to see those rectangular shapes but I wanted to soften the edges somewhat, especially for my output 1 image as I feel that this achieves the impressionistic effect whilst also looking okay. I also noticed upon looking more closely at my artistic precedents that areas of the land have much less prominent brushstrokes.
I have kept the sea at full opacity as I really like the way the overlapping ellipses interact with each other and I feel like it looks a lot like my artistic precedents and I like the brush-like effect that it gives.
I have changed the opacity of the sky to a much lower opacity, as a lot of my artistic precedents (Starry Night excluded) have a much smoother and more blended effect with fewer visible brushstrokes.

I noticed that in my first output image there was an overlap in the shapes where the masks for the land and the sky interacted, so I changed the mask a little bit and this made the interaction between these shapes much more satisfying and more like what I was wanting.

In my third output image I really like the small overlap where the sea and land masks interact and I feel it really increases the impressionistic look.
