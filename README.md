## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Taking the code given to us, I have replaced the source images with that of art depicting futuristic cities, due to the wide range and contrast of colours in each image.

The images above use the base code, with the point size being reduced as I wanted to initially see how true to the source I could get the outputs, whilst maintaining the pointillism appearance.
