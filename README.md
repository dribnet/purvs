For problem set 4 I will use part of my pattern from problem set 3. I want to keep it simple and still focus on mid-century modern abstraction. The most zoomed out section (seen in top image) will be basic and almost show a 3D depth to it. As the user zooms in (seen in middle image) they come to what my last hand in was for problem set 3 and then the final zoomed state is a more intense mid-century pattern which resembles a map.
