## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Created a quick hatch look which I think looks super cool with my colour scheme. Today I am also looking at thinking of themes that are more specific to me. I want a theme that will make an impact on the community. 

The images above are photos of my friend from an assignment from last year in the studio algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
