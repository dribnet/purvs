## VINPIXEL

From the very outset of this project, I wanted to create a font that was completely inspired by pixel art and vintage computer type. I have tried incorporating fonts like these in my design work for other papers this year because I love the retro and simplistic design language. Early on in the project, I looked for fonts online that I could use as precedents for my project. I found fonts like [Retro Gaming](https://www.dafont.com/retro-gaming.font), [Dogica](https://www.dafont.com/dogica.font) and [8-bit Arcade Font](https://www.dafont.com/8-bit-arcade.font), I knew almost immediately that I wanted to recreate a similar design but simplify it further and add a little bit more flair.

The first concept that I played around with can be seen in my physical sketch, I wanted to make the letters out of a few square 'pixels' which is a theme that I stuck with through the whole project. Another thing that stuck around in spirit is the concept that I wanted to make a very specific type of interpolation. I didn't know at the time that this would be quite challenging and something not a lot of my classmates desired to do. Really, my main inspiration was after I had thought of my initial concept, we were shown a project called [Type me, Type Me Not by Peter Cho](http://www.typotopo.com/typemenot/index.html). The third example which was one square that 'flipped' between letters as you typed was the fuel I needed to take thus project to the next level. What I really loved about Peter Cho's project was its ability to have the 'retro pixel' look while still being able to being something new and interesting to the table, I knew that I wanted to create a sort of spiritual successor to his project. The first interpolation that  I would concept out would be a type of falling animation where the pixels would fall into their corresponding place on the grid. This concept was super interesting to me but ultimately I thought that it didn't fit with the theme of vintage computer that I was going for. The same thing happened for my other initial interpolation concept, I wanted the pixels to shrink and grow when it changed but that faced the same issue as the other initial concept, it just wasn't very computer-y.

I put the interpolation aside for the time being and I focused on creating my letters first. I first made a grid that was rendered in the background with about half transparency, this was I could place all the squares in the same positions giving it an authentic pixel look. After that is was just a few days of manually placing each pixel for each letter. It wasn't too bad though, after a while you get the hang of the fact that the top left square is 2.5, 2.5 an the bottom right is 77.5, 102.5. The grid that I created for each letter was a 4 x 5 grid, I wanted to keep the letters as simple as I possibly could. I did this as a little bit of a design challenge but I also knew that I was going to be limited to 20 variables for each letter. that gave me 10 pixels max to work with because I would need an X and Y variable for each pixel. In the end, each letter is made up of 22 variables (I got permission from Phoebe for this) the reason why is because of the 20 X and Y variables needed but I also have two extra variables named `lightPixelClr` and `darkPixelClr`. These two extra variables make the interpolation seen in my final version possible.
