 size2 = width and height
 size2cont = width and height of contour

 xpos2cont = x position of contour

 ypos2cont = y position of contour

// top face

Started making a few of the letters, I had to go for a slightly 'chunkier' style that what I had designed earlier for some letters, however I do have spare parameters and I plan on basically having duplicate contours with the same parameters that I can place to create more detail. This will also help for quite sparse letters like L and J, where I cant make them with these current parameters
