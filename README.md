Each of my letters is composed of two triangles. The size and position is determined by the x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3 co-ordinates which are determined by the offsets.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x2 co-ord of the first triangle
  * `offsety` : y2 co-ord of the first triangle
  * `offsetx2` : x3 co-ord of the first triangle
  * `offsety2` : y3 co-ord of the first triangle
  * `offset2x` : x2 co-ord of the second triangle
  * `offset2y` : y2 co-ord of the second triangle
  * `offset2x2` : x3 co-ord of the second triangle
  * `offset2y2` : y2 co-ord of the second triangle
  * `xoffset` : x1 co-ord of the second triangle relative to the first triangle's x1
  * `yoffset` : y1 co-ord of the second triangle relative to the first triangle's y1
