My alphabet is based on the Morse Code, where the order of the goes from top to bottom.

this was not my first idea, but I ended up on it.

My first idea was to have a 3D cube subdivided into a grid, and then a letter in called it would pop the needed subdivisions with some sort of extra feature, would it change color or something else.
The cube would be divided in a 7x7 grid, and all the letters would look like the letters used in the original Nintendo Game Boy and Game Boy Advance Pokemon games(Red/Blue/Gold/Silver...).
After talking to Tom and seeing that there was a limit to how much variable I can use, I could not make that happen. So I decided to look at other inspirations, maybe something more simplistic.

After looking for inspiration I found Braille, I was simple. But I found it lacking in the usefulness of it, i just did not feel right.
Then I remember Morse code, the idea was similar to Braille, but had more depth and made more sense in a way.

My first idea was to more the dots and dashes around so that they look like the letter they represent, but I soon found out that that as well needed much more than 12 variables for it to look nice.

And that I how I came to this idea, a simple idea with a clean look.

The six parameters per letter:
  * `first` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the first character
  * `second` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the second character
  * `third` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the third character
  * `fourth` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the fourth character
  * `fifth` : Object shape(dot or dash) or null; of the fifth character
  * `offset` : the offset in the y axis; the more characters the smaller the offset(offset = # of nullâ€™s)

  * `length and Alpha` : I did not add this into the letter parameters even though they technically are, they are constants that chance in a set pattern in the interaction. So each letter has the same length and alpha

P.S. I was sick for most of the last 2 weeks so I did not show up to most of the tectues and did not do regular work, so my commits are lacking.
