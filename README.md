### Is it Time?

*Describe the idea for your clock here - replacing this text.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your 
image above. You can also include
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but complete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).*

With my clock I want to take the wide appeal of the popular binary clock[isitwednesday.org](http://isitwednesday.org/) and expand the concept to a universally relevant application.
**IsItTime** is a handy tool, useful when you need to check whether the linear continuum of instants has ceased.
