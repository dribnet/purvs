One of my experiments with the animation was with the colours alternating while the animation played. One of the effects I really wanted to achieve with this was have my 3 colours cycle once for each letter, making it appear as if the light was coming from a different direction for each letter. I couldnt quite figure this out but in this commit I have the two lower faces switching colours during the animation. While I like the effect i think that in combination with the scaling effect I think its too much and makes the animation look cluttered and janky. I think I will just stick with the scaling animation. I also added a few more words, to my swapwords, and I think I have landed on CAMPFIRE being my final name for font. This is mostly inspired by the colours and looking good with the letters. the colours reminded me of a campfire as it has the bright orange for the flame, but then it also has the deep contrasting dark blue which could be seen as the night sky, or as the hard shadows that often seen around campfires due to the single point light source.

should be useful in working through my code
