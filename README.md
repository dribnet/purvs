Part 4 - Exhibition and Final Alphabets Design


This is my final design of my alphabets. I was trying to think of another name which has the combination of the morse code and the triangles. However, the final name of my font is called "Morse Co", it's actually the short version of the name "Morse Code".

The parameters per letter:
  * `size` : length of the rectangle
  * `t1x` : x axis of the first corner of the first triangle
  * `t1y` : y axis of the first corner of the first triangle
  * `t2x` : x axis of the second corner of the first triangle
  * `t2y` : y axis of the second corner of the first triangle
  * `t3x` : x axis of the third corner of the first triangle
  * `t3y` : y axis of the third corner of the first triangle
  * `t4x` : x axis of the first corner of the second triangle
  * `t4y` : y axis of the first corner of the second triangle
  * `t5x` : x axis of the second corner of the second triangle
  * `t5y` : y axis of the second corner of the second triangle
  * `t6x` : x axis of the third corner of the second triangle
  * `t6y` : y axis of the third corner of the second triangle
  * `e1x` : x axis of the first circle
  * `e1y` : y axis of the first circle
  * `e2x` : x axis of the second circle
  * `e2y` : y axis of the second circle
  * `e3x` : x axis of the third circle
  * `e3y` : y axis of the third circle
  * `e4x` : x axis of the fourth circle
  * `e4y` : y axis of the fourth circle
  * `r1x` : x axis of the first rectangle
  * `r1y` : y axis of the first rectangle
  * `r2x` : x axis of the second rectangle
  * `r2y` : y axis of the second rectangle
