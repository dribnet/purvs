### Geometric Clock

After some experimenting with the frameCount function and sin waves I have found a way to implement the geometric clock idea I had originally planned to make. The geometries shift and rotate differently depending on whether they represent the hour, minute, second, or millisecond. I have been experimenting with colour, opacity and overall shape of the geometry and am happy with what I have achieved so far. For an alarm function, I could make the geometries pulse in and out rapidly.
