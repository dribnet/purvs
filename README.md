## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 6 parameters.

The trangles also use a fill with a slight opacty giving it a layered look.

The 6 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : x and y value of pointOne
  * `pointTwo` : x and y value of pointTwo
  etc..


- Added refined colour choices to better show layering.
