## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I have chosen to continue with the idea of snow, however I wish to make it more of a grid pattern that I did in the last project. I am wanting it to be a repeating pattern of trees and some sow banks in the first image. (top left). it will then zoom in to the picture to the right, where you can see close images of the trees. You can also see ski marks, from people skiing around the trees. 

The next zoom in, is the bottom left picture. you can see the trees in more detail and you can see the snow wells beneath the trees. 

The next zoom in, is the middle bottom snowflakes. To do this I will probably hardcode some snowflakes, and randomly generate them in a pattern or in a grid. 

The very last zoom in will be molecules, h2o.

I do not know how feasible this idea will be, but I am hoping I will be able to implement some of it at least. I think a focus of mine will be on the idea of pixel art and 'cuteness'.
