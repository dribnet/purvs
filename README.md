## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Update 1

I selected my images, moving away from portraits and choosing 3 shots which had a similar structure. All 3 presenting narrative through text, 

1) A photo of students illustrations explaining themselves on the wall of their since deserted preschool in Te Aro, Wellington

2) A photo of a tagged wall, showing a similar form of self expression but this kind illegal and presumably done by a teenager/young adult.

3) A photo of a hand painted, strong typographic sign which has been hung over another hand painted sign. The message here reads 'Teach Peace', and due to this message and strong design I interpreted it as an adult's work. 

As a result I have 3 images with links through message, structure, and focus. Each tells a story when displayed after one another starting of with a child's dialouge, then a teenager's, then an adult's.

I'm very happy with my masks, however I will edit further so painted elements are highlighted stronger. 

I have barely begun editing the code, and had errors updating the artwork_2 and artwork_3.
