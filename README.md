## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

【May.28.2020】
Practice.
I use pictures of Japanese food, Moroccan food and Chinese food.
These are the photos I took while traveling. Diet is an integral part of life. Although people in different countries have different lifestyles, people have the same passion and love for food.
I am still thinking about the theme. One current idea is to express the commonality of things that look different / the uniqueness of things that look similar.

These are some pictures of a toy room in a historic house that I recently visited.

Image 1 :
Simple try.
This picture is a doll beside a tea table.
Basically no code has been changed. I just changed some of the values.
For the mask part, I chose the eyes of the doll and the background. Trying to create a weird, scary effect.

Image 2 :
Text "Royal Carriage"
Make the mask by changing the text to white.
In order to show the text clearly, I used thin and short lines.

Image 3 :
I changed the maximum value of "i" to get a more detailed picture.
For the mask part, I used black, white and gray to divide the picture into three effects.
 Squares to represent the wooden train, giving a feeling of building blocks. The thin horizontal lines represent the area around the train, showing a carpet texture(This way the input picture and output picture will present different feelings magically). The background is filled with ellipses.
