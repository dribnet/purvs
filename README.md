## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos I have taken myself of my dog as a puppy. The mask highlights the entirety of the dog. I want to show a theme that relates to the negative imapcts of designer dogs and puppy farming that occurs in this country. For my second design, I am planning to have the dog represented by a wide range of dog glypths to show the idea of buying one puppy from a puppy farm meaning the suffering of lots of dogs and puppies.

So far, the algorithm uses my glyph design from the last project to do the dog, although I haven't altered it yet to get the desired outcome.
