### Episode 00 testing-test

so firstly im trying to see how this journal works first by doing some quick changes with the how it should be setup. this will merely be a test drive of what my journal will look like
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
preview.jpg (960x500) and thumbnail.png (230x120).
