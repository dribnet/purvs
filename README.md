This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part3. 

At this stage, I have focused on one face, and I want to give the randomizer the ability to customise the monsters colour, opacity, eyes, mouth and head tilt and also its hair.

I have focused on my third monster, altering the colours, adding horns, and other elemrnts, while also adding the ability for eyes of the monsters to look at the mouse position.
