Added circles that are mapped to each unit of time as visual movements.
Made each circle line up with the text so when it gets to "30", the circle perfectly encapsulates the number. 

Changed the stationary circles opacity so that when behind them, the moving circles can be seen.

Changed the background color to be a bit lighter.


I think for the alarm I want to make a red "sleeve" coming from the right slowly cover the blue background,
 and while the alarm is going off have the red sleeve blink off and on.
