The twenty parameters per letter:
  * "posx1": position of pos1x co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
  * "posx2": position of pos2x co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
  * "posx3": position of pos3x co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
  * "posx4": position of pos4x co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
  * "posx5": position of pos5x co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
  * "posx6": position of pos6x co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
  * "posx7": position of pos7x co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
  
 * "triposx1": position of triangle point 1
 * "triposx2": position of triangle point 2
 * "triposx3": position of triangle point 3

 * "posy1": position of pos1y co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
 * "posy2": position of pos2y co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
 * "posy3": position of pos3y co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
 * "posy4": position of pos4y co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
 * "posy5": position of pos5y co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
 * "posy6": position of pos6y co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
 * "posy7": position of pos7y co ordinate that draws my begin shape.
 * "triposy1": position of triangle point 1
 * "triposy2": position of triangle point 2
 * "triposy3": position of triangle point 3
