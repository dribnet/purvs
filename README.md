### Outrageous clock

This is my first version of my clock, it is a moving faded ellipse that could be contains the numbers.
And the ellipses may move around on the Center point.  And the time would be show at Four Corners and 
inside of ellipses as well. 

This the concept from tumblr, I got inspiration from this GIF. But for other section , I would change it 
such as colour, shapes and transparence.
