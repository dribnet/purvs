## Creative Coding 2: Pay Attention

For this project I initially struggled to come up with a meaningful theme. My original photos were street art and graffiti around Wellington and I used these photos to experiment with the code Tom gave us - like the tiling which I used for the background and foreground.

After the guest lecture I began thinking about more serious topics about humans and their impacts such as global warming, species extinction, pollution etc. He also said we should think about the location of our billboard and to try and cater our themes to the audience that would view this billboard. 

I started to think about how the other advertisements on this billboard are also trying to appeal and attract the attention of the audience. I decided to base my theme on this, the idea that the media/ company is constantly 'watching' its target audience and using the information they gather to manipulate the viewer into purchasing their product that they probably don't need.

I started by taking images of billboards or large advertisements that were selling materialistic products such as phones, shoes, clothes etc. I thought it would be impactful to include an image of the actual billboard that our final images are going on, so I included that too.

I then created a mask in the shape of an eye placed over the billboards to portray the theme that we are constantly being watched and targeted. I experimented with ways that I could differentiate the 2 masks by changing the glyphs/ shapes contained in them.

After talking to the tutors I decided to make 3 masks; the background, the billboard and the eye mask to add more layers and detail to my images. I wanted to use the glyphs that fill the masks to portray my message better. I made the background mask seem blurry by decreasing its opacity and drawing multiple ellipses and rects at random sizes and x and y positions. This brings the billboard mask to the foreground, showing how the advertiser makes its viewers only focus on the billboard.

At this point I was considering the scale that our images would be shown at and wanted to add smaller details relating to my theme that viewers would see if they looked a little closer. 
I changed the ellipses that filled the eye mask to actual eyes, made out of vertexCurves and ellipses. I then decided to add some small bank notes and dollar signs scattered throughout the billboard mask - to show what the advertisers really want from the billboard and its audience. I created these out of vertexCurves and lines and placed them in their own functions. I used some of Tom's code to randomly place these glyphs inside the billboard mask. I was having trouble thinking of a stroke colour for the dollar sign and bank notes that would show up well on all 3 of the final images - Hazel helped me with this by inversing the colour of pix and using this as the stroke.

Overall I am pretty happy with the outcome of this project. I think the small details I added bring out the theme better and will show up well on the billboard.
