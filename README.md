I ended up ditching the the array for the colours because I couldn't get thm to properly pull from the array into the fill, so because I mostly wanted desatuarated colours anyway, I removed the array and just pull random grayscale colours through the fill directly. I also found some parts of my code that were made redundant from changing to a random jitter to a noise jitter for the dispersion of the ellipses.
