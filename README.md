### Helix clock - sketch 

I disregard the domino idea and decided to go for a more simple idea. I started of with a simple wave that goes down the page to represent the speed of the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds. I had another idea to instead create a helix shape with the waves. It looks a lot more interesting then just one simple wave. The helix shape kind of reminds me of the shape of a DNA. I will keep the background black just so that any colour i pick for my helix, it will also stand out.
