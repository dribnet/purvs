Final font:
DIRTWORM.

I have drawn inspiration for my font from the idea of an earthworm, and the idea of ancient text engraved into stone. The worm inspired the idea of my text being a continuous line then wriggling into the shape of the next character. This is what I have kept the straight mapping for the animation, it looks like a worm wiggling around. The earthly colours I have chosen in my design look like soil and worm.  

The inspiration for my letterforms is drawn from ancient texts engraved onto stone, like greek and latin. In my final font I  decided to add some imperfections to my letterforms to make it look more handmade and natural. Looking at pictures of carved text, there are parts where the hand slipped and made cuts where there wasn't meant to be any, and over time the rock had worn down (this can be seen in this image https://static8.depositphotos.com/1465075/938/i/950/depositphotos_9384916-stock-photo-old-latin-writing-on-stone.jpg). I trialed this worn down look with circles and lines, and settled on offset lines to add this effect to my text. I was not hoping to achieve legibility as far as the english characters go, but rather achieveing the a cryptic form and aesthetic. 

The default character is a folded up worm, that stretches out into the other letters in the animation. 

I got rid of the worm ridges in the final version of the font because they did not move and in the annimation you could see they were just an overlay over the actual shapes. They looked good on still letters, but the illusion was ruined by the animation.
