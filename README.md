## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Monday 04/05/20: Opening github desktop for the first time. Sketching some ideas on how I want to approach this problem set. Changing colours to make sure that commits are working fine.

Wednesday 06/05/20: Sketch a concept idea which uses arcs, triangles, rectangles, ellipses, and lines to re create the alphabet in an abstract way. Planning on using transparency on the fill parts to make the actual letter stand out more for the user. Still thinking on if I want to use a question mark or a exclamation mark for my final character. Imgur link shows my sketch idea - https://imgur.com/a/lC8vumq  

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
