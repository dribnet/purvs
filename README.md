## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

After some thought and consideration, I have changed my goals for this project. Instead of limiting myself to only using two rectangles, I am instead changing to drawing each letter with 3 rectangles that are within a solid square that will stay consistent throughout each letter. This keeps a fun design challenge, only using three rectangles and keeping them within a square, and also frees me up to be able to make the more complex letters I was having some trouble with before. I feel it is also a unique look and fits with the "80s / 70s Title Card" aesthetic.

Today I made some changes to the code to reflect this new goal, adding in the background square and playing around with the editor to get each value range correct and useable. I also tried to make the colour for each rectangle able to change for each letter, however I ran into a few issues with this and will need to work some more to get this working. 


The parameters per letter:
  * `width1` : width of the first rectangle
  * `height1` : height of the first rectangle
  * `width2` : width of the second rectangle
  * `height2` : height of the second rectangle
  * `offsetX1` : x offset of the first rectangle
  * `offsetY1` : y offset of the first rectangle
  * `offsetX2` : x offset of the second rectangle
  * `offsetY2` : y offset of the second rectangle
  * `corner1` : how curved is the first corner
  * `corner2` : how curved is the second corner
  * `corner3` : how curved is the third corner
  * `corner4` : how curved is the fourth corner
