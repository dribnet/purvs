## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I followed the example videos from today's class and added in the grid example. I did not really like how this turned out for my pictures but thought it was worth committing to show my development. I thought that it made the pictures look too clean and took away some cool detail. However, when I was experimenting with changing the values from the example code to incorporate it with what I already had, I found that I really liked having diagonal lines rather than straight ones. I think it adds a cool effect so I will keep that feature for my pictures. I have also changed one of the pictures to fit in with the farming feed I am working with. 

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
