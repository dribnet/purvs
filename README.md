This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 
I have the mouth working, sliders 3 amd 5 control it in combination.  Each slider behaves slightly differently depending on how the other slider is positioned. I have mapped the x and y coordinates of the stitches without ever mapping the stitches in a concrete way, I simple entered the lowest and highest values. 

I am running out of sliders, so I am going to have to go with the top slider setting whether the doll is creepy or not, which is a shame because I wanted the option of dolls being part normal and part creepy


For my second face I want to play with the idea of abstraction and art. What if the flowers blooming on her cheecks were actual flowers, and what if there were real stars in her eyes?


I don't know yet what I am going to do for the third face.
