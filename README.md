Each of my letters is composed with three circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second and third circles are controlled by five parameters.

The five parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsetx2` : x offset of the third circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety2` : y offset of the third circle relative to the first one
