## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

here i played around with the different variables and i like the look of the books. i decided to make the rectangles and pixels quite big as i didn't really like the small pixelated look, like they were being censored or something. i also played around with the opacity and i think it looks pretty cool.
however, i don't like how the background looks now. i think the two parts look very disjointed and they don't match together. the foreground is very solid and the shapes are very straight, whereas the background looks like its been painted, it's quite soft and round. and the contrast between the two doesn't work in my opinion. i might change the background to have the same pixel effect so it looks more cohesive.
