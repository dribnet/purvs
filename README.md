## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

my first test with changing the function draw.
initially i swapped the rectangles and ellipses around, but i decided that i liked the backgroung as rectangles, so i ended up with 2 lots of rectangles. i also played around with their sizes, making the focal ones small and the background ones larger. my intention is to fill the background up more/make it look more solid, whereas the ones in the foreground are more spacious. i might play around a bit and swap them to see how that looks. i changed the background to black to make the colours of the books pop more as they disappeared against the white.
so yeah i might play around with the sizes again, see how they look the other way around.
