For my initial concept, i've thought about using one of my problem set two interactions as the zoomed view of my procedural map. I think that the detail and motion it provides creates an interesting canvas that the un-zoomed view could be built upon. For example, the un-zoomed view could consist of a much larger shapes that are made from the smaller pattern from problem set two.
