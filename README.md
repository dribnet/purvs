## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This version of experimentation involves changing the image into a grid of both square and ellipse pixels dependant on the mask. I've played around with differing sizes and spaces with a few different shape. The current design highlights what I want but more work is needed to better showcase this. There are currently issues with blank space at the boundary which was not the intention.

The theme I am going with at the moment is friends and family as they are an important part of my life and deserve to be captured and showcased. Permission has been granted for use of them in my photographs :)

Currently each image has a custom mask made by me and is processed with a grid of square pixels for the background and the subject of the photos is shown with ellipses.
