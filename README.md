## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2
Overall project
At first, I was at a loss for this project. For me, coding is a course that I am not good at. So at first I wanted to design pixel-style patterns instead of letters, but in the end I encountered difficulties because of my ability.Later, I decided to use the most basic graphics to form the shapes of letters and numbers, and the colors I chose were also fresher colors.

Inspiration
This letter image is inspired by Chinese mahjong, using lines and ovals to form different letters and numbers.

In the alphabet, it can be seen that some numbers are not displayed neatly, but they are "incomplete". I don't want all the letters and numbers to be completely regular, I hope it can be replaced with four shapes.At the end, I used the three words "colorful", "mahjong" and "Candice" as a display. First, "colorful" represents my color, brighter colors, and then "mahjong" represents my source of inspiration. Finally word is my English name.

In this assignment, I'm walking away with more knowledge of p5.js compared to when I started and I learned a lot and made progress compared to before.

The 16 parameters per letter:
  * 'posx1':x position of rect1
  * 'posy1':y position of rect1
  * 'posw1':width of rect1
  * 'posh1':hight of rect1
  * 'posx2':x position of rect2
  * 'posy2':y position of rect2
  * 'posw2':width of rect2
  * 'posh2':hight of rect2
  * 'posx3':x position of rect3
  * 'posy3':y position of rect3
  * 'posw3':width of rect3
  * 'posh3':hight of rect
  * 'posx4':x position of rect4
  * 'posy4':y position of rect4
  * 'posw4':width of rect4
  * 'posh4':hight of rect4
