## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

I've updated my little pig face ontot the new code and hope to move on now.

UPDATE

I've updtaed and merged the code from part 2 and I've also picked my faces, since its a pig, I've gone with 'Frank Oz' who is the voice of Ms. Piggy, 'Christina Ricci' who plays Penelope in Penelope - where she has a snoot for a nose - and finally Christine Cavanaugh who voices Babe.


UPDATE

Part 1, 2 and 3 have now been added to the sketch, I am now working on developing the faces.

UPDATE I'm still trying to figure out the code, I am struggling a bit and will rpobably need some help to achive what I am aiming for with this project. I've added the ears and started playing around with other factors, my goal at the moment is to make it look like each person has face paint on.

UPDATE

I've now with some help been able to understand the code better and what needs to be done, I've started adding the sldiers and parameters for adding personality to the faces, more on that later. but, so far I have make up on/off when its a woman, nose changes, eye colour and eyebrow changes and cheek colour changes -depending on skin tone-.

UPDATE 

I've started testing how the face quizzes working and seeing if my inputs and ideas are being picked up properly. At the moment im trying to differenciate between male and females, fair skined tones and darker skin tones, along side eye colour, nose shape etc. I've still got a few things to change but so far I'm happy with the progress.
