The theme that I chose to have in my project is more about the shapes in the pictures and how they relate to the shapes I’m using to make whole picture. For example in the first picture I use lines crossed over to make the spiral down stairs, which I feel makes for an interesting look. The second picture uses triangles pointing up to further emphasise the height and form of the buildings. Then the third picture uses a simple contrast of vertical and horizontal lines to separate parts of the image.
While doing this project we were given the option to use the smartmask tool. I personally felt that I didn’t need to use this however because I was only looking for specific shapes in photos. I don’t think it would have been much benefit to me, also considering it only took a few minutes in photoshop to get a mask I was happy with.
