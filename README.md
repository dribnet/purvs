### Recreation of John Maeda's 12 Clocks

This is my recreation of John Maeda's Clock. I changed the black-and-white colour into various colours. The mosaic squares moving on the background are very active and energetic so I choose some vivid colours. Also, I changed the text fond into more simple style so that the time could emphasized on the moving background.
