## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My code now consists of five shades of gray, creating patterns to differentiate between the various layers of the portrait and make it seem more blurred. I used white to highlight some of our facial features so that it is easier to find the resemblacnce betweem me and my brother. The parts are highlighted were the eyes, the ear and the mouth. Looking closer at the blurred parts, you could also identify some resemblance as well. 

For the second artwork, I decided to emphasize on the higlighted parts and only used black and white for the mask - and, yes, I also felt a little embarrased by the photo of myself, so I decided to make my face not that obvious. 

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the output and it has been fun finding out the similarities I have with my brother. It is a shame that my younger brother isn't in New Zealand or I would've wanted him to particpate in this project too.
