Part 3: OnScreen Zoom function
With my last part I had a tempory button based navigation system for my 3D scene, but now there is a onscreen GUI that will let the user click through with there mouse to navigate the scene. I do want to add it so it zooms in smoothly, but that isnt a priority just yet. The on screen navigation has 3 preset "zoom" points, where you can click to see the various points in the scene, along with a basic "arrow" style navigation to move around in the scene with.

<hr>
here are the button based controls:
-Arrow_up: move up
-Arrow_down: move down
-Arrow_left: move left
-Arrow_right: move right
- "+" Key : zoom in
- "-" Key : zoom out
