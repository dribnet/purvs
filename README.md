## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this problem set, I'm thinking of doing something based on tradition as I feel like it'll have more meaning compared to something that isn't. This relates back towards one of the universities main message on telling a story with heritage. So far, I've updated one of the photos, and will update the rest in the next session.

Started doing my second image, quite happy with how it's looking currently. I figured out that I wanted to mask the textures on the 'saris' so that it makes it more clear for the user. This is potentially an image I'll be using for my final as I'm quite happy on how it looks on the page. Currently in terms of ideas, I'm still not entirely sure what my overall theme is, so I'm still gonna base my designs around Indian heritage until I decided of one. My next steps are to finish the masking texture on the second output, then start to think of some new ideas for the third image.

Filling mask2 to get more detail on the small things. I need to play more with the shapes in this problem set and figure out if there's more to this problem set (for example more shapes or playing around with colour schemes).

Image 2 has been completed and I'm quite happy with it. It shows a lot of textures from the two sari's (clothing) which is what I was aiming for. As mentioned before, I need to play around with the limitations that this problem set has to offer. Thumbnail has been set to the mask to show how much detail has been added.

After playing around with the grid code, I decided to use aspects of it into my second image and was amazed on how good it looks with the original code that I had. It incorporates both ellipses and rectangles in a pixel art way which looks really good to look at it. The code so far uses a nested for loop which tracks both the x and y pixels on the screen, and on the side of that, it uses another for loop which adds ellipses depending on where the white space is on the mask. If I further refined image2, I could potentially use it as one of my final designs. I'm now currently working on the 3rd design, which is something to do with nature, but I'm not quite sure what message to send at this stage.

Started working on my third image. This will be more focused on the nature side. After all the events happening in America, I'm planning on basing this third image on the idea of nature and how they can't talk for themselves. This idea is very similar to the George Floyd situation, which both have this aspect. Another idea could be some sort of breathing message which is also used in both nature and the America situation. I still need to think on some ideas on how I could show this.  

I've decided that the only image that I'm not so happy with is the first image that I added. I then thought of some ideas I could portray in my photo, in which one of them was about neighborhoods. I wanted to have a picture which would describe Tawa. It uses the numbers '232' to represent the calling area with skateboarding dogs which are hanging out by the pool watching shark and fish tail skateboards splash around in the water. This was graffiti taken outside the local Tawa skatepark. I wanted to use this picture as it represents Tawa in one graffiti. For my mask, I'm wanting to highlight the features such as the '232' number, the lightning in the glasses, the Dtown shirt, and the chicken eye ball wings as these interest the users the most.

After playing around with the masks, I've filled the bits I wanted to show such as the lighting in the sunglasses, the 232 cellphone area code, the dtown shirt, and the eye chicken wing. My next steps are to potentially play with the colour schemes to highlight some of the important ideas in all three pictures. At this stage, I'm very happy with how my pictures have turned out.
