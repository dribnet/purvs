## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Opening github desktop for the first time. Sketching some ideas on how I want to approach this problem set. Changing colours to make sure that commits are working fine.

Sketch a concept idea which uses arcs, triangles, rectangles, ellipses, and lines to re create the alphabet in an abstract way. Planning on using transparency on the fill parts to make the actual letter stand out more for the user. Still thinking on if I want to use a question mark or a exclamation mark for my final character. Imgur link shows my sketch idea - https://imgur.com/a/lC8vumq

After thinking about my idea and the brief requirements for this problem set, I felt like it wasn't going to work as I was going to be using multiple shapes, and would need a lot more than 20 parameters. Potentially once I get the basic alphabet running, I will experiment will multiple shapes but for now, I'm going to be using rectangles to recreate the alphabet. After not figuring out how to actually get the code working, I finally got the hang of it and now am ready to continue the alphabet after A, B, and C. My next task is to figure out a way to make the rectangles rotate in a way which would use less parameters. I will also be playing with the colours in the future. 

I've now started to work on the letter.js file and have created D,E and F. This has been relatively similar to the first three letters except I needed to create a few more variables which half the size of the rectangle. It is still relatively simple, but I'm going to add more fundamentals in the future. 

After thinking about my original design, I thought it was quite plain and simple as it didn't have any abstrat features, and only consisted on rectangles which I thought was dull. I've decided to concept some new ideas onto paper which focuses on two main triangles and a rectangle if required. This uses a total number of 16 parameters. This concept makes my design a bit more interesting to look at compared to only having rectangles (this being a design choice). What I'm planning to do is to make one of the triangles slightly transparent as they overlap with each other, which creates a third triangle that you can see in between. I'm also still playing around the colours to see which suits well with each other. My next steps are to finish the alphabet, and add numbers and potentially a #. I'm definetly happy on where I'm at right now compared to where I was in the weekend in terms of workload and overall design.

I've finished creating the alphabet and two of the numbers, my next steps are to finish the numbers and work on the interaction and interpolation code. I definetly struggled with creating the U as I couldn't really think of any creative design for it. The 0 also could use some thought as it looks like quite similar with the o. Other than this, I'm quite happy with my work. My next steps are to finish the numbers and start on the interaction aspect of this problem set. 

Finished making basic alphabet. Next steps are to modify the letters which look a bit odd (G,N,Z,3,9). Quite happy with where I'm at right now. Once i've adjusted the alphabet, my next steps is to create the interlopation function with my paramaters. 

After my previous update, I wanted to complete the interlopation section and come up with some words that I wanted to display for my exhibition. Currently, I'm thinking of having a twitch.tv themed alphaebet with colours purple and white in the future which has twitch emotes used for the exhibition such as PogChamp which is a common emote used for when something is hype. I'm very happy with where I am at right now as i've pretty much finished the main things, and now onto the adjust stage. My final design incoporates two trianges and a rectangle to compose a slightly abstract but readable alphabet, which has been my goal since the beginning of this problem set.   

There were some letters in my problem set which originally didn't look quite right such as the L,N,S,3,9. These definetly needed changes and have been fixed to make it look a bit nicer for the user. Because my concept is focused more around twitch.tv emotes, I've decided to update the colour from red to purple as twitch is focused more on the purple user experience (especially in their logo). My final steps on this project is getting the editor working as I have not touched that aspect of the code yet. I've definetly made reasonable progress in this session.   

Currently using 16 parameters:
  * `triangleX1` : first x point of 1st triangle
  * `triangleY1` : first y point of 1st triangle
  * `triangleX2` : second x point of 1st triangle
  * `triangleY2` : second y point of 1st triangle
  * `triangleX3` : third x point of 1st triangle
  * `triangleY3` : third y point of 1st triangle
  * `triangleX4` : first x point of 2nd triangle
  * `triangleY4` : first y point of 2nd triangle
  * `triangleX5` : second x point of 2nd triangle
  * `triangleY5` : second y point of 2nd triangle
  * `triangleX6` : third x point of 2nd triangle
  * `triangleY6` : third y point of 2nd triangle
  * `rectX` : x point for rect
  * `rectY` : y point for rect
  * `rectW` : width dimension for rect
  * `rectH` : height dimension for rect
