I have now completed all of the characters in the alphabet including the numbers. I also went through and adjusted the cut outs of some of the shapes to make them more recognisable. After doing this I asked my flatmate Adam if he thought any characters looked funky for some extra feedback. He said I should change the four and make some of the cutouts more constant in size. I made these changes on top of the ones I already made and now my alphabet is complete.

The goal for the rest of today is to start the interpolations so my characters flow easily from one to the other.
