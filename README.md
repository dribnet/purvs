## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

##Created this sketch of ABC using sine waves.

The parameters per letter:
  * "wave2": does it need a second sine wave for the letter, true or false
  * "offsetx": x offset for first sine wave
  * "offsety": y offset for first sine wave
  * "offsetx2": x offset for second sine wave
  * "offsety2": y offset for second sine wave
  * "rotate1": rotation in degrees for first sine wave
  * "rotate2": rotation in degrees for second sine wave
  * "peaks1": how many 'peaks' there are in first sine wave, can go negative to flip it
  * "peaks2": how many 'peaks' there are in second sine wave
  * "peak1H": how 'high' the peaks are for first sine wave
  * "peak2H": how 'high' the peaks are for second sine wave
