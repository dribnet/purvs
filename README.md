## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2
 
Each of my letters will be composed with one circle, one rectangle and one arc. The size and x position of the first circle is fixed, but the positon and size of the arc and rect changes with each letter and is controlled by the parameters. I have started with very simpistic forms that are similar to my handwriting and have a soft, readible design.

The eleven parameters per letter:
  * `ellipseY` : y position of the main circle
  * `width` : size of the arc
  * `height` : size of the arc
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the arc in relation to the circle 
  * `offsety` : y offset of the arc in relation to the circle
  * `angleStart` : angle to start the arc
  * `angleStop` : angle to finish the arc
  * `rectX` : x positon of the rect
  * `rectY` : y positon of the rect
  * `rectW` : width of the rect
  * `rectH` : height positon of the rect

To refine my design, I have rounded the edges of the rectangles to make them match the curves of the ellipse and arcs. I really like how it turned out and I think it makes my design more cohesive as I said I wanted to have a soft design. Doing this also allowed me to go through each letter and make sure all the little details were how I wanted them to be. For example, some of the rects had a slightly wrong x position that did not line up so I was able to fix this. I am pretty happy with the current state of my design.
