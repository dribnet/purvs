## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I have now done all the letter and have done some of the numbers. I'm working on making everything look nice rught now. such as having the dot not coming out of the a and b. I also need to do some more linning up of the letters and making sure that they all fit inside the boxes. I'm currently playing around with colour and I find that having one of the shapes as just line weights and the same colour as the background give the work a very nice effect. This is complemented but the smaller fully coloured shape. I means that your eye is drawn to the cutout of the shape making it easier to determine what the letter is. I'm liking the new colour sceme as I feel it looks a lot more professional.
