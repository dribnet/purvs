REFINING MY FILTER TO MY THEME

Today I swapped out my middle image so that my series and theme was a bit more clear and cohesive. With my theme highlighting the pressure people feel on how they should look due to our societies beauty standards. My series represents how people feel angry and upset when they look at themselves and how people are pressured to look a certain way feeling like they are stuck behind a wall/mask and trying to break through to reach out to the other side where they can be free.

I changed my filters to focus more on my theme. I went back on my first images mask and added in more detail by masking the hair in grayscale. I will need to go back and adjust my other 2 masks. Since my theme is based around self-image with society's beauty standards I wanted to have good contrast with sharp shapes and soft shapes. The background is made out of triangles in a grid format to look like shards of glass, and to represent society's harsh standards and expectations. Then I have her face and hair as dots and arcs to show a soft and delicate individual. The waves in the hair are all over the place so I need to work on structuring that a bit more.
