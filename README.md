As I progressed through my generative landscape I decided to make it appear as if it were a landscape for a 2D adventure game. I've refined the randomness of my trees, added some houses, and a mountain range in the background. I plan to mask the landscape so it appears within a circle but I am having trouble using this function in p5.js.
