This is my sketch for the concept i want to take with the alphabet.
I want to go by the rule of using just two triangles for each letter.
I want to create the letters using different angle and size triangles starting with a base triangle of 3 points.
My decision to give this a go with triangles is because I like the idea of having different points and of trying to develop lines and circle like shapes that certain letter involve.

This is sketch of A B C 
- I have found that it takes a wee while to get the points right so I have noted down what points/lines each variable of the triangle changes to make it a bit quicker when going through the full alphabet.

I am thinking that i may have issues with making certain letters look different to one another so i am sure i will encounter a lot of experimenting to see how creative i can be in making 2 triangles look like a certain letter.
