## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

My idea is to show a mechanical part that from big static appearance to the small gear. The image will turn the rotating shaft into a gear.To show the effect of small technology in promoting the development of Mechanics.
I first tried with algorithm code (practice) but it wasn't work weel when zooming. So I back to the normal way. The final effect is not much differen't from what I sketch. What I didn't achieved was I wanted to make the gear turn in a 3D way. But I didn't figer out the code. So I rewrite the gear a breathing effect.

This project was quite a challenge for me. At first(the practice one) I was trying to make every ellipse become gear when zoomed, but that's quite hard. If I can do it again I will try to work out a 3D outlook but change shapes when zoomed.
