## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images I have created in this assignment are an abstraction of the lights of buildings in the Wellington CBD. The photos used were part of a photo series depicting light. My final code reinterprets light and dark producing a abstracted interpretation of the lights of wellington city.

I really wanted to take images and produce an image that simplifies and abstracts the original. Use of clean lines, lack of colour and high contrast was an aesthetic decision I felt suited the design I achieved.

After a lot of experimentation and different ideas I began focusing my design on how I would represent light and dark space in an image. I decided on using randomness to show darkness. This randomness is reflected in the rain I produced in my final images. The rain is a representation of noise, which in photography occurs when you try brighten dark/black parts of an image. The horizontal lines represent the lights of buildings. These lines are straight and rigid much like the buildings they are taken from, but can’t be seen. Combining these two opposing elements creates tension in the image. The dynamic of forever falling rain clashing with the static lights coming from the form they hide. 

As my design was focussing on light, the smart mask program didn’t really give me an advantage over simply using my image as the mask. With the code I could control much more easily what was masked and what wasn’t. Although I can see how in other situations it could be useful, such as masking objects or people. There is a tradeoff however as It can be pretty inaccurate. Using photoshop would produce better results but at the expense of time.   

This project was challenging as I didn’t want to simply recreate an image with different pixels, but instead took an image and produced an abstract interpretation of it. I felt I spent more time trying to come up with concepts than actually coding them. But having iterated and changed through ideas I feel I have come up with a concept that effectively reinterprets light and darkness in images.

I’m very pleased with the final images I have produced in this project, and after battling  with many concepts I feel I have arrived at an idea that fulfils my goals for this project. I also really enjoyed taking my own photography and pushing it further as well as being able to integrate photography and coding, two mediums I am passionate about to create a new and exciting art form.
