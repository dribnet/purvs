## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two ovals. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second ovals is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second oval
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second oval relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second oval relative to the first one

04052020 for this  i changed the colours, having a play around with the two ovals and the background. I then changed the shapes from using ircle to oval by changing some of the primative used.
