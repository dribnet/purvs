### Clock ideas

The Meter Clock: A very simplistic interpretation of timekeeping where different meters representing hours, minutes and seconds run from left to right.

The Globe Clock: This idea spurred from the Meter Clock where I imagined the interface of the clock be projected on a spherical surface (Earth). This would imitate the rotation of the Earth and be comprised of 24 hours.

Water Clock: This idea spurred from research regarding actual water clocks and would see the trickling down of water into each jug whenever they reach their maximum capacity.

Eye Clock: This clock is simple in terms of technicality but its more of the aesthetic. Each eye would blink responding to change with the value they have (individual digits).
