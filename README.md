## Creative Coding 2: Pixel Corruption 

The 3 images above represent a landmark in 3 asian countries I have visited. The first one is the 18 meter life sized 'Gundam' Statue in Tokyo. The second picture is the 'Daydream' statue fountain in Taipei main station. The last pocture is the statue of 'Rose Chan' greeting you as you leave the Takashimaya Mall in Singapore.

The main idea behind the pixel design is that real world elements such as buildings, the subway or the sky are represented by orderly pixelated grids, while the more outlandish and cartoony statues would be represented by random rotating quads, as well as larger and longer quads acting as highlights to certain areas of the image. 

Black(0,0,0)- Wild (Smaller quad).
Grey(100,100,100)- Wild2 (longer quad).
White(255,255,255)- Background (pixel grid).


This represents how art and design can bring excitement and new life into reality, and that even though the things represnted in physical form by the statues do not exist in real life, they still impact us, as real people in one way or another, be it a pretty landmark to gaze at, or a representation of imagination.
