## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos I have taken myself of my two dogs. The mask highlights the two dogs to show their friendship that they have with each other. I was thinking I could also develop this idea further by having the 3 images from different years so one of the dogs will go from being a puppy to an adult. 
I altered the algorithm slightly to make the circles smaller and more frequent than the squares.
