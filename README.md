## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Iteration:
These are the images that i'm thinking of using for my final images. I'm not too certain on the first image as I didn't put much time and effort into thinking about the mask because I lost the original mask for the input image. Compared to the other two images there is no visual interest like the other two which have focal points. I mainly just wanted to capture the reflections in the water for a pretty colour which is shown in the image where the perlin noise is created with interesting dynamic and procedural-like colours. For the mask I wasn't sure what to mask because before I had been going off the formula of masking the focal point of the image but since this image is just reflections it didn't really have a good focal point so I just applied a threshold filter to it. I will most likely look into my different images and play around with the masks and parameters again til I feel like the visuals of my images are a continuing series to help with the narrative.
