## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

With my pixel idea I want to make the background look more robotic and mechanical, while the foreground is more organic and natural. I am going to do this with shapes like with the pixels I'm going to use two squares and with the smaller one of the squares being black or while simulating a microchip and the organic one could be done with random shapes that use vectors.

For my images I want to use pictures that I took in first year that I never used, or I want to use things I enjoy like a camera for photography or food.

The layout at the moment is neat in the background and orginaized to show a robotic style which a calculated look and more random in the foreground to show a more organic style. I still need to improve and iterate my styles in the foreground and background and upload images.
