## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Here is the crosshatched version of my photos, I like the results, especially with the rubix cube and the legos. The rubic cube shows more of its shape than the version with the circles, this is one thing I will consider when making my final version of it. I think its important that I keep my designs abstracted but also keep the form and shape of the objects so that the viewer can identify what they are. I am considering whether I keep the crosshatching later, I think I need to experiment more to decide.
