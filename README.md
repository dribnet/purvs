## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

The progression is now as follows:

0. original pattern
1. dark diamond added
2. diamond is lightened, inner lines of main pattern is added.
3. diamond is lightened again
4. second pattern is added
5. orange outer line of second pattern is added, ellipses are added faintly
6. orange outer line gets thicker, ellipses get darker
7. ellipses appear the same colour as the original background


At zoom level 9 i have attempted to re-pring the original pattern to try get the pattern to look like a nw start when you zoom in on the ellipses, however it seems that my machine might not be powerful enough for that, The mostly-finished code is there in this version but I may have to find some other way to finish off my zooming.

my final steps after that will be to add animation and the tour paths.
