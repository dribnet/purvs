i've disregarded the domino idea and started to play around with the Sun Function. I didn't really wanna show the time but to show the speed of the time. I made these DNA somewhat look-alike wave that shows the speed of the time. I like the contrast of the black bacground and the colours of the waves. Its nice and simple which i like.
