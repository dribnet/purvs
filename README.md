## PS2 MDDN 242 2018
so far I already put the code of exibition into my code and it works well. I put some words in the wordlist to test. 
I finally name my font as "OREOTIME" since I inpired from oreo cookies.
Before I turned into exibition, I had an idea about creating a list containing colours like strawberry colour, chocolate colour and milk colour. Then using random funcion to randomly pick the colour from the list then apply on the filling of oreo. However, because using random function in this project may course some extra problems, as well as I am satisfied with the brown and white colours now, so I gived up this idea.
Later I may change the background colour into a more fantastic one.

The parameters per letter are now:
	* `status` : the status of two status of cookies, show or hide
	* `movex` : x position of where the coordinate of the first cookie will move to
	* `movey` : y position of where the coordinate of the first cookie will move to
	* `r` : how many degrees the first cookies should rotate
	* `r2` : offset degrees of the second cookies should rotate relative to the first one
	* `r3` : how many degrees the third cookies should rotate
	* `r4` : how many degrees the fourth cookies should rotate
	* `offset2x` : x offset of the second cookie relative to the first one
	* `offset2y` : y offset of the second cookie relative to the first one
	* `offset3x` : x offset of the third cookie relative to the second one
	* `offset3y` : y offset of the third cookie relative to the second one
	* `offset4x` : x offset of the fourth cookie relative to the third one
	* `offset4y` : y offset of the fourth cookie relative to the third one
