## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

  idea: draw the design out of circles and arcs with varying opacities so it has a sorta ghost-like effect. I could use true/false features to make cloudy effects in the back. I plan to assign a colour palette to each letter using if statements - there was a good website shown in the second class for that. My design will be a little abstract, bt I want people to be able to tell what each letter is after they're told

I finished my basic alphabet today - the 's' and 'x' were definitely the hardest letters out of my code to make, but I'm fairly happy with them. Over the break I think I'll work on having a colour change between the letters and then if I get that sorted, then maybe add to the ghosty effect by possibly adding faces or something
