This is my first idea about this project. My idea is combining the circle and line to generate the A B C. 
My idea is to make the circle have gaps and no gaps and let the straight line bend ndn deform to achieve the formation of letters. 


However, according to my current thinking it will lead to more than 12 variables. So i will optimize and chagne them later.
