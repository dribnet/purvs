Each letter in this experiment is made out of two layers of circles. The back (orange) ones make up the shape of the letter while the front (white) ones act as the 'negative space' usually in the letters. I don't think this is a super effective font when it comes to move complex characters but it was fun to play around with shapes and I like the look of it. I used loops to draw the number of circles on each layer and change their alignment.

I used the parameters:
 * `backTriCount`: number of triangles in the back layer
 * `frontTriCount`: number of triangles in the front layer
 * `frontAlign`: how much to move the front layer of circles on the x axis
