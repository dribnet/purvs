## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have added grey to my mask and made another if statement to incorporate it into my code. At the moment I have added in the cross-hatching effect into the areas that were looking too plain and needed some more detail. I am happy with how this turned out and found the code not too difficult to implement.

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
