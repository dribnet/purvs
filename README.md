## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I still want to use my idea from project 3 to impliment even further. For my idea in my sketch, I want to do atleast 3 simple zoom:

1. The first one is showing the close up of my wallpaper, nothing too special

2. The second one even closer to it but we can see all the rectangular wave form that the movement of the water surface create.

3. The third one is zoom is even more into the wave form to see more randomly generated bubble.

4. I want to impliment the 4th one if there is time in this project. I want to put some pixelated micro bacteria in the water.
