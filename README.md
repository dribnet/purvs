## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Just started playing around with different settings and what not for my photos. The photos I've chosen are all from one night of drinks with my friends, as they're mostly photos of people on neutral backgrounds so I decided to make the rectangles smaller and  more spread out so to bring the focus to the fore-front with minimal distraction.
