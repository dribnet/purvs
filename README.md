## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Ihave decided to take some insparation from bauhaus. I've noticed in their fonts some of the letters are very obviously what they are, but some of the letters are a bit more abstract. On their own you can't tell what they are, but as soon as their in a sentace with other words your mind autmatically fills them in without a hitch and you don't even realize what you've done. I think that I might also play with the colour sceme a bit more. I'm also liking the way that the shapes flow from one to the other.
