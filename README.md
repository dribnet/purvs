  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

Feels like I've properly started now and I have a good idea I think. My project is going to be called "Black Tape", all the letters are gonna be made from triangles and appear to follow gravity and collide into each other. The black tape 'sticks' the triangles down so that they don't fall. As an extra challenge and for a cool aesthetic, I want all the negatives spaces formed in my letters to create triangles as well.

Two extra rules i've decided for my letters are:
 + The tape's width can't change
 + low down letters, a,c,e,etc. have to be all the same height and high letter's have to be all the same height
In terms of coding today I finished my sketch following the rules I have set out and now it's onto creating the whole alphabet!

This idea came about from me wanting my letters to be a bit wonky and assymetrical to give my letter's an organic feel.

I really like my colours at the moment but they may be a tiny bit too intense.
