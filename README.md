PART 2: GENERATIVE LANDSCAPE (City Grid - Night)

My work for part 2 generative landscape was largely aided by the coding train tutorials by Daniel Shiffman on perlin noise (see link in sketch.js). 

The direction I then took this work in was initially inspired by development of road networks (if you imagine looking down on a country or state from above). I then developed this further with the concept of a birds eye view of how a city grid - such as manhatten - might come alive at night with activity. Starting first in key hubs and growing outward until every block is alive and active.
