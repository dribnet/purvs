Watch till 0~16!
Final:
Got tour working perfectly, if you dont use a tour to find the middle point, you can't really follow the circle.

Idea summary:
First round (random doors and sneaky hand of ghost's opening for you, door looks 3D as well opening inwards (inside the screen))
Second round (texts that make you follow the middle circle, still random text positions and if you go in further, the texts look more creepy)
Third round (showing this random shape with this weird ribbon in the middle and it should look like that it's facing from the top and slowly rotating down as the zoom goes in further(Ghost face might come up!(who knows)))
Last round (candy treat for Halloween + uni tri finishes)
