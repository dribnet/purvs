### Cliffside Clock

This clock is based on the circadian rythm of the tides. As the tide goes in and out it hits notches for the hours on the cliffside. The sky indicates am/pm, a bird flies across the sky each minuet and the waves are spaces a second apart. The alarm is a seagul flying into the secondary cliff edge and squarking.
