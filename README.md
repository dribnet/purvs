PART 3

I started part 3 by making additional improvements to the positional mappings for my facial features. I noticed in part 2 that some of the facial features weren't positioning or scaling correctly or consistently so fixing this was my first priority.

One example of the changes I made was adding additional mapping of landmarks to the wrinkles/eyebrows(which ever you see it as) so that it responds more to the facial expression, rather than just being a line from point a to b.

I also replaced the black fill of the mouth and brows with a more natural colour to try to make it look a little more like my gollum inspiration.

Lastly, I set up some additional properties that changes pupil shade, eye colour, and eye shape.
