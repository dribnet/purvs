I've incorporated randomness into my design, and have started to contrain some of the variation, particularly that of the eyebrows (as at one point all the brows in the grid were going their separate ways, so each face just looked comical rather than showing lots of emotions).

I still need to add some more aesthetic variances so that there is enough interest and variation in each face to keep the viewer engages, as at the moment they are all the exact same face with different expressions. 

As far as adding the remaining facial features, hair, etc goes, I'm thinking I'll draw an assortment of them in photoshop and allow the program to select a feature at random from the array.
