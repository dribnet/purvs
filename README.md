## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I was not happy with my previous mask so i wanted to adjust this so that the model (me) was in focus and you could still see, with only the background slightly altered with the effects and colours.

At the moment there is a bit too much going on in the photos, so I need to switch a few things around so that you can see more of the original image.
