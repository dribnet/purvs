I was inspired to draw characters from Star Wars as they have very recognizable features. Princess Leia and Yoda were chosen as they have very different faces shapes and features. This would contrast well when put into a grid. 

I decided to make Leia's facial expression very sad/angry and Yoda's expression to be quite happy. This emphasizes the varse contrast between the two characters. I purposely made Yoda (10%) pop up only a fraction of the time that Leia (90%) does as it gives the grid more of a variation.

Some experimenting was done by changing some of Leia's features such as having two hair colours, making some of her faces more pinched and making her head tilt. I decided to keep her hair colour the same as it was too different and cluttered the grid. This kind of blurred the contrast between Leia and Yoda. I ended up keeping the pinched faces (40%) and the head tilts (40% right, 20% left).

For the final layout, I decided to make it quite random and have the faces float around without much structure. To me this emphasized the contrast as you won't expect yoda to show up. In the grid layout, the faces had their specific spot and it would either be Leia or Yoda. But in this layout it's all over the place, giving no clues.
