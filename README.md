## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This version of experimentation involves changing the background part of the mask to display lines rather than rectangles. These lines are drawn with variation in the form of random numbers altering their x and y values to make the background not stand out compared to the people. I think they could still be further highlighted though.

The theme I am going with at the moment is friends and family as they are an important part of my life and deserve to be captured and showcased. I aim to highlight them by making the background a clear secondary component in the output. Permission has been granted for use of them in my photographs :)

Currently, each image has a custom mask made by me, 3 tones (Black, white, grey) and is processed with a grid of ellipses for the subject and the horizontal lines for the background.

The Code has now been functionalized! It is still quite messy with plenty of unused parts from experiments and could do with more concise comments and code optimization.
