As I began training the faces I noticed that the hair disappears when both hair and face color were lightest. To solve this I added a stroke to the hair dots.

When training the wrinkle variable I decided to add a wrinkle to the face if the person looked over 25, add two wrinkles if they looked over 50. I was judging the overall face if it was wrinkly not just specifically the forehead.

After training all the faces I tried out the train quiz. It was kind of hard as they were all pretty similar which isn't good. I will need to add more variables or change existing ones. I feel like the hair dots isn't obvious enough. 

I asked Christina to test out the train quiz and she got most of them right so it might be okay.
