## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I drew a 5 sided polygon in green (but can make it mirrored) hence it appears to have more sides.
I added a black circle on top which is the same colour as the background to add some negative space. the colour scheme was inspired by the matrix which I saw the other day. The style of the letters i want to make are sharp sided. Please note my code efficiency is really bad and needs improvement.
My parameters are:

"drawmode" which chooses the line of symmetry for the polygon horizontal or vertical (or none)


the 5 x and y coords to draw the shape relative to pos x and y of the letter:
"x1"
"y1"
"x2"
"y2"
"x3"
"y3"
"x4"
"y4"
"x5"
"y5"
//ellipse parameters:

"ex" x pos of black ellipse
"ey"  y pos of black ellipse
"eheight"  height  of black ellipse
"ewidth"  width of black ellipse
