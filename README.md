## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

This sketch has been developed from one of my iterations in PS3. I used shades of blue on 
a grey background for one of my wallpaper designs. It reminded me of a water molecule, this
sketch has been developed from that concept to create four layers which will you will be 
able to zoom into. 

Zoom One: Liquid motion 

Zoom Two: Stiffer closer/faster motion (boiling water)

Zoom Three: Wave motion 

Zoom Four: Static H O H
