Going into this project my first step has been to do some research and start thinking of patterns and color schemes. So far, I've been inspired by the works of Holger Lippmann and the colour schemes used in his work. Next step is to keep developing the color scheme and start looking at patterns and shapes.

UPDATE

I've started looking further at the style and shapes to use for this project. I really like the idea of layering complex shapes under simplers ones so I'm currently trying to make progress with that.

UPDATE

I'm trying out a second concept and playing around with possibilities, I've been exploring what my background code can do, what I can do with the colour scheme and the shapes over top.

UPDATE 

Still trying to decide what path I want to go down with this projet, still trying out new things and bits of code but really enjoying the layering, still not certain on the colour scheme.

UPDATE

I've think I've come to a colour scheme that I really like, as with my shapes I wanted to have a bit more layering with it, so added the bluer shade to background, so my layers become blue (background), pink(horizontal noise lines), white(dots), pink(circles) and white (circles outlines) again. I'll now move on to starting my landscape. Still deciding on ideas for that so I'll see where that takes me.

UPDATE

I've been working on my landscape and finalizing the patter, some changes had to be done since bringing all the code together into one js file created some clashes. So far so good though. I've been inspired by a lot of work online and been grabbing bits of code that i could change, adapt and learn from. All of which are commented on my code. I plan to still add some last minute changes but the assignment is almost complete.

UPDATE

I've been working on finalizing both the pattern and the landscape for this project. Still working on the code I want to use but getting to a finalized stage.
