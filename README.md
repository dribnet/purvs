## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

From the begnning I had played with a white snowflake with a simple blue background so I'm playing around with different colours to match the snowflake. I want to make sure each line complements each other while also making them a little different from one another to make the difference stand out more.

I'm going to continue to play with colours before my final animation
