## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have yet to take photos but atm I have an idea I will most likely stick through with.

My idea was inspired by a video I remember I came upon quite a while back, by Jubilee. In the video, 50 random people of different ages are asked the same question - "If you could change one thing about your body, what would it be?". The answers given by most adults in the video showed how common it is for people to be uncomfortable in their own skin. In contrast, the small children who were questioned gave answers that revolved around their imagination in a positive way. The children and the adults interpreted the question differently from each other, which I found interesting. Their answers show that during the early stages of childhood, (hopefully most) children are content (pure and imaginative as well), but as they grow older they may come across situations that negatively impact the way they feel about their body and cause them to feel insecure, such as bullying and the beauty standards depicted (especially from media as in our society today, it's everywhere). I think it's important for everyone to love and accept the way their bodies are, in order to be happy in general, so I've chosen this theme to hopefully help spread this message.

Atm I'm thinking of having a series of silhouettes of people with different thoughts in response to the question in the video, ranging from a small child to a teenager to an adult for each panel. I don't think I'll be able to have a child and teenager pose for me, so I might end up drawing the silhouettes. Furthermore, drawing is my hobby so it'll be nice to incorporate that into my project. However, the people's thoughts are either going to be hand drawn, coded or both, so it'd be nice to take photos for the silhouettes so that there's a variety.
