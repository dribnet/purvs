## PS1 MDDN 342 2017


I've updated my little pig face ontot the new code and hope to move on now.

UPDATE

I've updtaed and merged the code from part 2 and I've also picked my faces, since its a pig, I've gone with 'Frank Oz' who is the voice of Ms. Piggy, 'Christina Ricci' who plays Penelope in Penelope - where she has a snoot for a nose - and finally Christine Cavanaugh who voices Babe.
