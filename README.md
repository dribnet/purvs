## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

In this project, I have taken the monsters I made in PS1 a step further and incorporated elements from the devil as well as applied a more refined colour scheme to reflect this. To push this idea further, I have used photos of well known dictators as my input for the code to map these devil masks to. The idea is to show these dictators as devils/monsters but also to make them look silly.

This idea has led me to exaggerate characteristics such as the hair, eye and mouth size. The nose can also be adjusted, as well as hair colour, moustache, eye direction, horn length and horn colour.

In training the code, I have kept the aspects relative to the photos, but features such as the horn length/colour are based roughly off the age of the person in the photo, and moustache depends on whether it is a man or woman.

Overall with this project, I have applied features to create a cartoon style mask over very serious characters to create an interesting contrast and feel that it is a nice wy to make fun of these people.
