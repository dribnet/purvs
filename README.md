## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Iteration:
I am struggling to find the third and final image for my final output. The 2 current final photos that I have selected are photos that are underneath different docks. To have continuation in my final output I want all three of the images to be underneath docks because the project is based on a narrative represented in a visual image having a hole in the narrative makes it confusing for the viewer so I want to have a visual continuation not only in aesthetic of the algorithm applied but the subject of photographs used to apply the algorithm too. 

I'm struggling because I only have one other image that is of decent quality but it didn't have any depth of field because it's under a dock there isn't much light so I had to use quite a large aperture(hand not steady enough for a long shutter speed shot at because of the awkward angle). To fix this issue I had to apply some shoddy depth of field in post using a field blur. Fortunately the image is quite large 6000x4000 and it has allowed for a lot of play with the composition of the image in the 1080x1920 specifications used for rendering. What i'm struggling with is finding a composition that i'm happy with, adjusting the depth of field of it in photoshop to fit the composition and rendering a nice image after that process. But I don't like any of my renders but these are some that I have remembered to save for commit, again some process of changing the parameters of the strokeweight and masks, still generating 5000 particles.
