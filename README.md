:memo:  
The lighter purple ellipse rotates around the centre based on the feauture of the letter. For example, A could be seen as a triangle / fan, so it has a fan shape in the middle. B has two little half circle on the side, and C is like a complete half circle.  *working on putting triangles* 

Updating my sketch today, I chose to use rectangles, triangles and ellipses to create my letters.
