## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The above images focus on Water, Land and Sky.
The left photo is of fish in a tank at the aquarium, the right image is a shot of the sky on a sunny day, and the middle image is of a serene field near Hanmer Springs.

The order of the photos is based on colour, where the left photo is primarily green and brown, the right photo is primarily blue and white and the middle photo is an equal combination of those four colours.

The mask consists of white, black and a subtle grey in between them. The black areas draw semi-random line strokes, the white areas draw small circles and the grey areas emit a few squares with relativley coloured strokes.
