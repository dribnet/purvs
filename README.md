This README explains the distributions grid
In this iteration the whole idea is it looks cute, until you realise why it is so unsettling

I wanted to change things up again, and make them quite different for this iteration. I decided to experiment with just a few creepy dolls amongst a lot of normal ones, in the hopes of dialling up the contrast. The problem was, some of my changes were simply too subtle to create striking differences, and show distribution, on their own. So I decided to switch things up a little, particularly in terms of colour. All dolls now have a 5% chance of being redheads, and a 5% chance of being blonde, in vibrant doll-hair shades Those who have black hair are now on a spectrum from black to dark grey hair. Creepy dolls who don't have red or blonde hair, now have a green or blue tint to their hair, which helps them stand out just enough, while still blending in, to give the viewer a shock when they spot them.

I have, for now, removed the cartoon faces, as they are no longer needed within this iteration to create contrast.

Here are some other distribution choices I have made:

There is a tiny chance that a cute doll will have a creepy eye
Eyes are more likely to be large than small
the dolls are more likely to be close to upright than very tilted
It is more likely for a dolls cheeks to be mid range-to bright.
there is now a small chance a doll's hair-bows may be pink or green
there is still a larger chance a doll will be smiling
medium length hair is more common

The final result of this iteration is a lot cuter, and I will be dialling the creepy up a bit more for the final iteration, but I think it is nice to see the cute side of these drawings.
