This version contains the final state for my pattern sketch. The result is quite an interesting grid that features random diamonds with dots relative to their size. Since the last state I've refined the line weight, colours and opacity to make the pattern a well rounded, intentional design. 

I've also added in the beginnings of my transition to the landscape state with the spacebar acting as the trigger button.
