## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In this version, I have not think about the theme of my three photos. I used my photos which I took at Shenzhen MOCAP museum, China. I really like the architecture which built a lot of glass walls from the sunshine came in. It makes me feel comfortable and good for the environment because it saves a lots electricity. 

Then I start created these three images. I used triangle shapes in the black mask and create arcs in white mask. It created out the concept of the MOCAP museum, all about geometry in the reality. 

I had use three different codes in these three images. The stairs one cannot fit on the shapes that I created for image1 because it has not intensive light came through it.
