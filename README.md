## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

31/05/2020

My overall idea for this project is too do to use photos of area of bush walks, this has personal significance to me because I used to go on many bush walks with my dad when I was younger.
With the masks I want to make the thing that shows up in the mask clearly stand out from the rest but be composed of the same elements. Ideas I have to make the mask stand out at the moment are; change the angle, change opacity, change colour, make the elements bigger.

I have loaded two of my photos into the project folder and I have started messing around with different functions to create the affect of something being painted.

To try and achieve this at the moment I have created a function with multiple bezier curves seperated by 20 pixels each. And then have made them go in random places on the canvas 2000 times. Moving forward I want to seperate the beziers by a smaller amount and add more curves like a brush would have.
I also want to use multiples layers of 'paint' so that it is easier to make out what the picture is and to add more interest/detail.
