## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

The images I chose are some pictures I've taken of different beaches over time. I chose the beach since the sea around New Zealand is all connected and these are all places I've visited in my life. The artworks are all washed out and slightly white around the edges to represent how I remember these pictures even though the images capture these places perfectly. My two different rendering types are oil painting-esque, soft colouring and another style that is supposed to show through like line paint strokes.
