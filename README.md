Still porting my experiment sketch code into the framework provided.

In my last commit I forgot to use the parameters that I defined. I changed the vertex parameters and quadraticVertex parameters to the stated letter variables. In doing so I found errors in my code, some of the variables were not correctly named.

Also in my experimentation sketch I believe I did not consider how center_x, center_y translates the drawLetter function. So I had to add a secondary translate function so the letters can be drawn in the center of the screen.

I added my "secondary canvas" the rectangles. As my font is inspired by the gestlat principle figure-ground.
The figure being the line and the rectangle the background, I'm hoping that my font is either percieved as a literal font or just some floating shapes.

- Removed the experimental sketch "Sketch2.js"
