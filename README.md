Here are the nest few letters up to p. This set of letters was interesting as I started dealing with letters such as i and l, which had no curved lines at all. It took a little bit of experimentation before I arrived upon these interpretations of those forms. I also made the decicion to use the dark coloured arc as the dot that normally appears above the lower-case i and j, as realized that even though the dots were very small and miniscule compared to the rest of the form, they were very noticeable on their own. When I considered omitting them, the forms did not look like a complete representation. The m was an interesting challenge, as I did not have a lot of space to work with in placing the three arcs. After some consideration, I became inspired by the black letter representation of m, in which I decided to place all the arcs alongside eachother as such. 

The fourteen parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
