## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
My theme for this custom pixel assignment is Recycling in Wellington.

I wanted to get photos of ways that wellington city council and Wellingtonians are contributing to recycling. 

My first photo is of the wellington city council rubbish truck, I have masked out the ‘Absolutely Positively Wellington’ logo along with the reduce reuse recycle symbol in the middle and the photo at the bottom of recyclable items.

I have chosen to use square and ellipse shapes to pixelate the photo to create the depiction of the areas that have most importance in the photo, I have also layered the photo in a way that I could have the ‘Wellington City Council’ yellow colour in the background masked through around the areas I want to enhance. 

My second photo is a line up of recycling bins outside my house, I thought this photo would hold importance in my theme in the way that it shows the simple things we can do as Wellingtonians to contribute to recycling in wellington. I took the photo through blinds to border out the bins. I have masked the line up bins as this is the important area of the photo. Again I have the yellow background masking through the middle of the image where my main mask is.

My third photo is of the 3 bins that we see around uni, I wanted to include an image that shows the contribution we have at uni to wellingtons recycling. This pulls together my theme of recycling and Wellington to vic uni in which our theme should portray the values Victoria university holds.

I have added in another message within the image by masking out the signs on the bins in symbolism of the fact that we should be able to all know what bin is for what rubbish items and should automatically just be able to put them in the correct bin. We should be at a point where we don’t need to be able to see the signs to know where to put our rubbish.
I also wanted to have student pixelated in the image to portray the act we as humans have in recycling and the impact recycling has on us and our world. 
And again I have the yellow Wellington city council colour masking through in the important area of the image where the signs are.

I had a lot of fun taking images and changing the image to depict my theme.
I hope that I have been able to put across the message of the importance of recycling and the ease of making a difference in wellington in our everyday lives- while tying the theme in with Victoria university.
