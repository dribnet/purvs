## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel



25/5 
I have played around with the code and have the triangles on a few random variables so there is more variation between them. this gives more of a poly art feel but it makes it significantly harder to see what the image is and what it represents. I want to play around and see if i can have the mask be more detailed to see the image clearer at parts.

--- have also encountered a problem when my code is pushed that one of my artworks doesnt appear ---



At the moment I have played around with shaped and have tried to take insiration from Low Poly Art to make my images. I have made some progress and am quite happy with it at this stage. I want to try using different shapes or polygons. Also trying to implement a randomness to it with regards to size or shape if I get that working. If i can I want to map the shapes to the fill/colour but dont know how well that woul work or how to do it. Want to work on the masking effect, maybe changing the size because at the moment it is all uniform.

Want to experiment with trying and using a very good clear image that has a mask from a different image and playing around to see the effect this has. Or even two different masks maybe? - colour and shape?
