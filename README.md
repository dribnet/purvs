## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Here is the final second image of a orchid branch. I really like how this image turned out as the smaller flowers I think really show that it looks ike it is made up of crystals. The triangles and squares are interesting and I think that the opacity matches really well. The background of shattered glass look really interesting as well as it looks like it is made out of hairs as well. The simple image of this i think works well and I like how itÂ turned out.
