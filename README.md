Final

The inspiration for this alphabet came from the one I saw before, which is used to help young children learn English easier with pictures.
On the Alphabet page, I created each letter and number with the pattern of different images. The first letter of the name of each pattern represents that letter. Besides, the form of the designs is showed by the grid.
On the interaction page, I have a problem with the transition between characters. It because I draw the patterns with gridding
structure. The process of changing a character shows only what the previous letter and the forward letter have in common. I tried to, but there was always something wrong. Anyway, I think it is fine with the transition because you can still see the change between the letters.
Finally, on the exhibition page, the style I choose is lovely and sweet. So I pick "01CUTE23", "67SWEET8" and "CHILDREN" as my swap words to highlight the main style I created.


The three parameters per letter:
  * A pattern in the form of a grid(14*14)
  * The first letter of each pattern's name represents that letter
  * The rest of the pattern is hidden except for the main part
