## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Using the same technique of stretching the ellipses to amplify the colour as I used in the other images I wanted the stretch to mimic the curves of the clouds to look like waves in the sky. Going further I want to update the mask so the mountains and buildings have a different texture to the sky and clouds.
