Final Color Scheme
=======
This is the colour scheme I have decided to go with. The plae, pastel-like colours are soothing and appealing to the eye and work well together with the default background colour that Tom chose - which was a complete coincidence.
I feel as though this colour scheme has a little bit of a retro feel to it, which I emjoy and find appealing.

My parameters are the 12 boxes that are either on or off depending on which letter they need to make.
