## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

For for my two faces I have three sliders.
The first face uses these sliders as controls for the rotation of the entire face, mouth openness, and the size of the pupils.
The second faces uses these as controls for the size/shape/positioning of the two face shapes, eye direction, and openness/emotion of the mouth.
I have yet to do a third face, but I am pretty set on this second style for the next part of the project.
