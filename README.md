## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today i was able to fix my pixMod in my design and I really like the effect of it. I have had to make the flower size bigger which has moved some of the shape around because of the array, however I like it better because there is more definition between the flower shades

I have also opted to only make slight changes around the stroke colour. I want to stay true to my theme of natural beauty so making the stroke slightly darker gives this effect well without it making the flower seem fake. I am also glad I moved the output_2 and output_3 around as the balance between the three sits better
