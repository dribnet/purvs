## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have played with the spacing and found that i like the look of having elements (circles and squares) that are more relative in spacing and size. Unlike my previous experiment where the background where there was almost no spacing which gives a more pixilated effect. I find i like this more mosaic looking image.

I noticed in the third pic that there was a problem with loading half of the source imagine hence why it is half gray. This intrigued me though so i want to look at masks and also blocking out things in my pic potentially.

I am also deciding upon a theme. I'm unsure whether to have my subject matter be flowers for a more natural theme or my niece smiling for a theme of geniune happiness. 
I will experiment with both also looking at adding more masks and see which i like more.
