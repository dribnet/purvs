PART 1: Iterative Pattern (Wallpaper)

I have used a series of for loops to generate my tiling patern for part 1 of assignment 3. I tried to design something that could not only be infinitely tiled but would look good at different scales (small diamonds or large diamonds). I narrowed the colours down to just two - which could be interchanged depending on the colours you wanted for your fabric, or to have as wallpaper in your room - as well as playing with stroke opacity for the final effect.
