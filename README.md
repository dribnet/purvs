So this is the start of my new idea. My idea is using lines to replicate the lower case of the alphabet, From here i want too play with specific lines are thicker and maybe a different colour. Thinking about making the most stable line a bit thicker. I have 8 parameters at the moment but this can be cut down as some parameters are the same. 

The 8 parameters per letter are now:
  * ptx - X cord for 1st line point
  * pty - Y cord for 1st line point
  * ptx2 - X cord for 2nd line point
  * pty2 - Y cord for 2nd line point

  * ptx3 - X cord for 3rd line point
  * pty3 - Y cord for 3rd line point
  * ptx4 - X cord for 4th line point
  * pty4 - Y cord for 4th line point

  * ptx5 - X cord for 5th line point
  * pty5 - Y cord for 5th line point
  * ptx6 - X cord for 6th line point
  * pty6 - Y cord for 6th line point

  * ptx7 - X cord for 7th line point
  * pty7 - Y cord for 7th line point
  * ptx8 - X cord for 8th line point
  * pty8 - Y cord for 8th line point
