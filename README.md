## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Now I have added in my photos, which I want to process with the code to output an image that represents how technology affects our connection with ourselves and each other. I kept the photos themselves very basic, and they aren't especially high quality because I want to focus more on what they are going to become through the code. Now that I have put these photos in I can work on tailoring the code more to these photos. I need to adjust the grey on the masks as this was not the same grey I used previously, I also might lower the saturation on the photos as well. I think the body needs to be more defined because the cellphone needs to be a lot more obvious, right now it is becoming lost in the other shapes. 

I used the smartmask tool on a photo from the internet, but I will not use it for this because I want to set up my masks with three shades that highlight some of the main areas but also the grey is deliberately not following a distinct area of the photograph, so I would like to make the masks myself. I'm not using a complex issue so this shouldn't be an issue.
