### Helix clock. 


I have multiple ideas to what i wanted my design to look like once the alarm went off. My first idea was to have multiple random circles fill up the background and making them a bit transparent so it wasn't too strong, but i came across a few problems so i decided to change my idea and make it more simple. So i've decided to just have the ellipse grow in size and change into a brighter colour - green and yellow. i think changing the colour really had a nice effect, it really stands out especially over the black background. Also when i think of alarms, they alert you, give you some sort of a shock feeling and they catch your attention which i think the colours really help protray that feeling.
