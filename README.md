## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

Have gone back to experimenting with the rectangles and ellipses. I like how this image is looking so far. I have removed the stroke on both the rectangles and the circles, and am more happy with this compared to when they had the outlines.
