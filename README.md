Part 2 - Alphabets design

The following is the design of my alphabets. The grey color circles and rectangles are the morse code, the pale red color is the triangle and I arranged them with the circles and rectangles. After adding the triangles, the letters look better than only circles and rectangles and clearly shown. In addition, I have actually used more than 20 parameters for designing my alphabets. However, only part of the parameters are used in each letter, not all of them in each letter. Lastly, I have designed my alphabets till letter 'P' and I will continue working on my alphabets design.

The parameters per letter:
  * `size1` : length of the rectangle
  * `c1x` : x axis of the circle
  * `c1y` : y axis of the circle
  * `r1x` : x axis of the rectangle
  * `r1y` : y axis of the rectangle
  * `t1x` : x axis of the triangle
  * `t1y` : y axis of the triangle
