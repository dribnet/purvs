## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I tried playing around with the colours in the grey area of the mask. I changed the blue value for when red is less than blue to a lower number to mute the colours more. I actually really like how this effect turned out in the 3rd picture with the grass. As there were already a lot of bright colours in the picture, it allowed the other aspects to stand out more as they are brighter and your eye is drawn to them rather than the grass. However, unfortunately it made the sky yellow in the 1st picture which I really did not like. I had to go back into the mask for this image and cover that area in black so that it did not get caught in the if statement. 

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
