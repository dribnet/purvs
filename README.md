This is my final typeface that I have named “SHARPEST” because of the sharp angles and points that are used within the triangles to create the letters.

My first sketch on paper was doing with lines and triangles, I like the idea of using triangles as I feel as though there is a lot to explore.
When starting the sketch of A B C on p5.js I found that it would be a more challenging and creative idea for me to form the characters out of just 2 set triangles and no lines.
I have developed the 2 triangles using 12 parameters.

For my final typeface, I have used bright contrasting colours blue and pink to emphasise the two different triangles forming the characters. 
I have also made the stroke colour white to take away from the lines as I want there to be more view of the triangles.
I wanted to work with triangles as I have (as strange as it sounds) always loved maths mainly geometry so was excited to think of created this project using triangles and points.
I enjoyed working with the triangles and developing the letters and numbers so differently to how I first envisioned. 


I wanted to create the rotating aspect of the interaction as it leaves you with a sense of not knowing where the triangles are going to end up to create the next character.  The parameter I used are: 

“T11x" = x First point of triangle 1
“T11y" = y First point of triangle 
“T12x” = x Second point of triangle 1
“T12y" = y Second point of triangle 1
“T13x" = x Third point of triangle 1
“T13y" = y Third point of triangle 1

“T21x" = x First point of triangle 2
“T21y" = y First point of triangle 2
“T22x” = x Second point of triangle 2
“T22y" = y Second point of triangle 2
“T23x” = x Third point of triangle 2
“T23y” = y Third point of triangle 2

I also used parameters for the rotation interaction:
“rot1” = Rotation of first triangle
“rot2” = Rotation of second triangle
