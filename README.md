So far I've exhausted my parameters and use all 20. They are the following

The three parameters per letter:
  * "posx" : X position of the rectangles
  * "posy" : Y position of the rectangles
  *	"pos2x" : X position of the smaller triangle
  * "pos2y" : Y position of the smaller triangle
  *	"pos3x" : X position of the larger triangle
  * "pos3y" : Y position of the larger triangle
  * "pos4y" : X position of both arcs
  *	"pos4y" : Y position of both arcs
  * "arcS": Start of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arcE": End of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arc2S" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  * "arc2E" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  *	"recA" : Y-coordinate of both rectangles
  *	"recB" : X-coordinate of both rectangles
  *	"triX2": first X-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2": first Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2A" : second Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2A" : second X-coordinate of each triangle
  * "triY2B" : third Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2B" : third X-coordinate of each triangle

  So far my main goal is to retain a sense of visual uniformity through the shapes I create. I want to make sure that each shape does not appear off. Thus I need to make sure that my primitives do not bend or stretch in a manner, which appear unbalanced. Still figuring out a color scheme. However, I like to go with something more saturated and retroesque. Pastel colours, Memphis Group and VHS recorders come in mind. This is very much in tune, with my usual output, which tends to be somewhat kitsch and heavily inspired by early film.
