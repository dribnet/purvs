## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Full Alphabet

I added a static triangle that doesn't change throughout. I think it adds an interesting look to the design as there is a contrast between the rounded letters and the sharpness of the triangle's points. 

Each of my letters is composed with one arc and one line that work around a triangle. The size of the arc is fixed, but the length of the line and location and angles of both arc and line is controlled by eight parameters.

The eight parameters per letter:

  * `lineX1` : The x coordinate of the first point of the line
  * `lineY1` : The y coordinate of the first point of the line

  * `lineX2` : The x coordinate of the second point of the line
  * `lineY2` : The y coordinate of the second point of the line

  * `arcX` : The x coordinate of the center of the arc
  * `arcY` : The y coordinate of the center of the arc

  * `start` : The angle in degrees of where the arc starts
  * `stop` : The angle in degrees of where the arc stop
