Development

I had decided to name my font “sunlight” because of the colours I had chosen to use.When I was going through my parameters I realised I had more than 20 so I had take out an extra parameter for a circle I was gonna rim each letter and number with. I then extended out the lines making them over lap and stretch out horizontality. I stretched them out horizontality in order to fill the empty space between the letters so they look more connected and related across the canvas. I reduced the stroke weight of the lines so the letters and numbers were more visible. I decided to add dots to the background because when I think about sunshine I think of how the sunlight shines through dust in rooms, so I wanted to incorporate this idea of floating specks into my font. I chose to make the dots blue to contrast against the overall warm orange palet of the font.

The colour of the letters and numbers were changed to a light yellow so the layers were more soft against the background lines than white. The lines of my letters were designed to follow in the same lines as the background lines in order to keep the background lines connected to the overall shape of the letters, so I reduced the stroke weight of the lines to flow against the lines better. I like the look of the lines being a different thickness to the to the circles because it makes some of the letters more visible against the circle. In early stages the lengths of the letters were determined by thicker background lines. I am thinking whether I should keep the overhang look of some of the letters or whether to restrict the lengths to the lines; heights and widths.





The parameters per letter:
  
  * 'size': size of main ellipse backdrop
  * 'lx_1': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'ly_1': y co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lx2_1': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'ly2_1': y co-ordinate of line2
  * 'c1x': x position of main ellipse
  * 'c1y': y position of main ellipse
  * 'lx': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'ly': y co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lx2': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lx3': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'ly3': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'lx3_1': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'ly3_1': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'lx4': x co-ordinate of line4
  * 'ly4': x co-ordinate of line4
  * 'lx4_1': x co-ordinate of line4
  * 'ly4_1': x co-ordinate of line4
