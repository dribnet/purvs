## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

In PS3 my generative landscape was based on the concept of a Manhatten city block coming alive at night with activity and lights. Thus, I thought it could be adapted quite naturally into this idea of the power of 10. 

My sketch below is made up of some screen grabs from a dev mode of google maps (night mode). It is probably a little more literal than I am intending, as I would like my PS4 work to be a more abstract version that could possibly incorporate the 10print to construct a grid. 

That being said, the screen grabs convey how I would like to scale the city grid and the way the lines change the further out you go - morphing from grids into something more organic.
