## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
At the moment I'm feeling a little stuck with my images, I have a few ideas but am just not really 100% sure how to actually do them. I'm going to post into the design_feedback channel and seek out some inspiration online too. I'm happy with the digitalised colours in each photos, they're still very rough and really need just more depth to them. I'm hoping to get some tutorials from Phoebe of how to incorperate grey into the mask.png files to bring more to the photos, I tried putting grey over some of the trees, etc but it didn't have any effect.
