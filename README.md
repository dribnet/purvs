## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My final project was based of my interest in large stained-glass windows. I have always been fascinated by the transparency through the colours of the glass, this is a concept that I wanted to iterate with my letters. I decided to use triangles and play around with the opacity of the fill to reveal a third colour between the 2 shapes. This created more volume and made my design more dynamic as it emulated the stained-glass window effect with the light peering through the glass. Early when designing my shapes, I had the intention of making my design abstract with the overlay of the shapes and the hard edges of the triangle. Playing around with the positioning was fun and going through trial and error of different colours of the background and fill of the shapes was a complementary learning experience. One thing that stays consistent in stained glass windows is that they have white edges to break up the different shapes. This was a design decision that I made later in the project that I think really brought my design to life. The addition of the white dividing up the triangles made it blend nicely into the background canvas as well which was a pleasant surprise. Changing the background to white solidified my decision of my design because it really emphasises the letter characters and fill of the triangles as the black and previous light blue washed out the characters making the characters look dull. With my numbers I decided to not add any overlay or opacity simply due to confusion and readability. It was important that you can identify the letters from the numbers; I made sure that I kept the same colours so that it all looked cohesive. After countless of re designs and adjusting the points of the triangles I finally believe I found an alphabet that best complements my concept and idea.  Overall, the style is tidy, readable, colourful, and exciting!
