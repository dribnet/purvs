I managed to change the size of the cirlces and how many in frame which resembles snow a lot more which i'm happy with. I think this looks good for now in terms of the asthetic when you first see the frame. 

Again, I will continue to work on the code to make different snowflake shapes. I feel confident that I can get it to how I orignally intended it to look, especially with the time frame.
