## PS1 MDDN 242 2018

I wanted to make a simple yet pleasant looking clock. I used the simplistic idea by using just grey and white, as well as circles and lines. Then I added some more interest by adding a bit of colour. I've set it so that the hand that the millisecond hand has it's RGB values change depending oh the second, minute and hour that it is. I also made a slight flash of colour for the millisecond hand every 90 degrees.
