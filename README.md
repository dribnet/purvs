### My Version of Maedaâ€™s 12 clocks (Number 4)


This is a recreation of clock four.

I made some changes when I recreated the clock. I found that the overlapping and partly transparent numbers were difficult to read so I didn't make mine overlap and made them solid colours.

The numbers on my clock are larger than the numbers on the original to make it easier to read.
 
I also did not include the seconds in my clock so it was simpler to recreate.
