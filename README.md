## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I created a function within a mask that draws the crosshatch effect within the specified value. I also added in a final image. I am aiming for a very mellow, warm toned aesthetic. I liked the concept of having my image transformed into paintings.
My first two images have the crosshatch effect with my third just being vertical lines. My second image uses rectangles, I wanted to see if rectangles worked better with the lines. I quite like how it looks on the building but I will have to see if it works with the other images.


I've taken images from a recent visit to the Auckland Botanical Gardens, this is because I enjoy visiting this place and I love nature.
