## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

##New Theme/ Experiment 2

I ended up changing my theme idea. Instead of having buildings of Wellington CBD with a layered mask on top, I decided to put out images that are a little bit more meaningful and has more of a message to show to the public.

The images above are basically 3 images which show how we are so disconnected to the world as we are often on our phones/technology. Because this is a "one time" opportunity to have my work show up on a billboard, I thought that I may as well have something up that matters which will get people thinking and show them what we're becoming.

The masks which have been overlaid on top of each photo highlights important aspects within the image, however, I haven't actually changed any of the code from my last experiment, but my next plan is to apply grid techniques to create a "jail-like" background which enhances that kind of "disconnected feel" that I am aiming for within my final images.

This is the final theme I am sticking to and I will be further refining these images until they are up to the standard that I am happy with.
