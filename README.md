## Powers of 10 PRINT

This program is based on my sketch from part 3.

It creates a randomly generated map using noise .

--Zoom--
The first and second zoom levels give you a zoomed out version of the map, allowing you to see it from a
general perspective. The 3rd zoom level provides more detail and starts showing key highlights from the map.
This allows you to zoom in further to investigate these features. The final zoom level gives you much more detail,
by showing all the small shapes and features of the landscape.

--Biomes--
The program has 4 biomes : Tiaga, Jungle Forest, Decidious Forest, and Lake.

Tiaga: Snowy Biome with snowy trees, and houses
Jungle Forest: Bright green dense forest
Decidious Forest: Reddish trees, flowers, and caves
Lake:  Lots of water, with seaweed and rocks.

--Design Intentions--

Because this kind of terrain generation has been done quite a lot before, I tried to focus on retaining my
"cute" style from the last sketch, and keeping the style distinctive. Following my previous project, I tried
to not change too much about the "ascii retro top down game" aesthetic..

Randomness was also something I tried to focus on, like in my last project, and with the addition of the
biomes, I feel a good amount of detail is obtained.

--Extension--

Again there are lots of things I would have like to extended in this design. I would have liked to add lots
more terrain pieces, and hidden objects.

I would have also like to have the most zoomed-out view be more distinctive, by adding some biome indicators
at this level. I also only put in 5 zoom levels, and adding some more could have helped extend this design.
