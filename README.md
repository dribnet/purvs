PART 5

My progress so far for part 5 as I near toward the end of the project. 

I have included 4 of my own images; Gollum, Andy Serkis, Andy Serkis and his wife, and Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm version).

Although the face doesn't really look like Gollums, he was my original inspiration, and so I thought it would be interesting to try to map my face to the real Gollum. What's more, because Andy Serkis did the motion capture for Gollum - and because Bilbo had a Gollum moment in the first movie - I thought it would be cool to include them too. 

I still need to make further adjustments to the properties before submitting my final work as I'm not sure all the saved values I set are right for some of the faces.
