### Flower Solar clock

For my clock my initial/original idea was to create a diming clock but it didn't really end up as I wanted it to be so my second idea was to create something that was similar to the Polar clock which was one of my inspirations. So with that I created four lined circles for each hour, minute, second and millie. But the reason why I used lined circles is so that once it combines together it will kind of look like a flower. The dots that's outside and around the hour represents the clock face so you know what time it is. 

For my alarm I wanted to make use of my background, so for that once you click the background it will change colour which sets the alarm on, which takes around 19 to 20 seconds for it to go off which again changes to a darker colour so that it makes it more effective.
