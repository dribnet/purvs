### Conway Clock Implementation

--------------------------------------------------

I elected to recreate clock #6, featuring Conway's Game of Life.
Since getting a still frame of the automaton would be tedious, I elected to just implement it outright.

I've also switched my project to TypeScript, as it's something that I've been wanting to learn.

For performance reasons, I zoomed in the view a bit more than the source gif.
The timescale was also slowed down so you can better appreciate the automaton's activity.
