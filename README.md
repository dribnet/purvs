## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
As i havnt had time to take the photos i want for the project i have started to experiment with the code to make it fit how i want my overall image to look. I have focused on making the background to look very digital so i focused on a using the grid code, so it looks pixelated then i have played around with different stroke colours and weight to encourage this. i like how this looks as it does look very digital. once i get my photos i'm going to experiment with my masks and code to bring the whole composition together.
