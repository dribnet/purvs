## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Andrija Djorovic

I looking into a pixel style similer to my 3rd assignment, mainly by using the Hexagon as the main element.
The theme revolves around my best friends in my teenager years, my dog Tobi.

I'm trying a few different thinks for my style, I have 2 that I'm looking into now,
my vision is that the image will have a clear foreground and background:
#1: circles in the background and hexagon in the foreground 
#2: both hexagon in the foreground and background, but the background is made to look more washed-out by adding a white hexagon ring.
I also make a custom mask for my image, as I was using one for the given one in the first push
