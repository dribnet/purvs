### Cuckoo clock

I have finally decided on my idea for my clock. I will still use the idea od how time was kept in the past. I will however use the idea of a cockoo clock with the weights moving up and down in corellation with the time changing on the clock. I will also try and have a bird pop out when the alrm goers off like a cockoo clock. 

I have put the basics of the design together now. I really like how its looking but it could definetly use some polishing up. I want to get the pendulums to the point where they go up and down not just resetting. I still have to think of the bird when the alarm goes off. So i have yet to play around with the alarm functio and get it working because I am a bit behind. Aswell as maybe doig the clock in photoshop and importing it in.
I still have the clock itself to get working in relation to the time. This will only be hour and minutes however.
