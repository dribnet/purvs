## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

I've decided to continue in the aesthetic I developed for ps3, and so am going to develop my lily pond environment further and make it more suited to this new brief. 

The first zoom level (top left quarter) will simply look like an abstract dot pattern. The detail of the pond is revealed at level 2 (top right). At zoom level 3 (bottom right), forms under the water start to emerge, and details are cleared in the lilies. Finally, at the final zoom level, the water becomes clearer, and fish and rocks appear under the surface.
