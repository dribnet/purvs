## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

"Neoblock" by Hayden Watson

Starting out in this project, my intial ideas for how I was going to make my letters was simple, use shapes to make the shapes of the alphabet. While we were testing out how to use these files and making our planning in sketch.js, I decided to play with the idea of using those shapes to instead make a letter using negative space. So instead of the shapes and parameters making a letter; they do the opposite, they go around the outside of a different color background (The base rectangle/square) in order to make a letter. So I continued to play around with the idea of using Negative space to my advantage while also using a minimal amount of shapes and parameters. I managed to make nearly all of my letters out of only 2 ellipses and 1 rectangle, however there were a few letter that I was not satisfied with and really wanted to change.

I ended up making another rectangle and 2 more parameters in order to make those shapes better and it worked pretty well. Because I used basic but effective shapes, my interaction and interpolation was very very easy to make and the default values worked a charm. 

Overall I am happy with my design and the techniques of negative space that I used to create it worked really well.

I finished with a total of 12 parameters:
sizex
sizey
offsetx
offsety
rect2x
rect2y
cirsize1
cirsize2
ciroffsetx
ciroffsety
cir2offsetx
cir2offsety
