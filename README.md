### Final Heartbeat Clock

This is my final heart beat clock with an alarm. The heart beats in time with the seconds. The three rings are representative of the hours, minutes and seconds. When the alarm is set a countdown appears until the alarm goes off which then smaller hearts appear in random spaces.
