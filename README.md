## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

my second test
i swapped the sizes around, with the bigger shapes as the focal point of the image. I liked how the original code was very colourful and i wanted to show the colour of the books and for that to be the main point of the images. im not sure about the rectangles though, so i might see what other shapes look good instead.
also for the background, i changed the rectangles to lines. i played around with a few different variables when it came to the lines; the amount of shapes being drawn on the page, and also the size and length of the lines. firstly i tried them long (100) and thin (no strokeWeight), then i tried making them shorter (50) and thicker (strokeWeight 20), eventually i came to what i have currently. i liked the long and thin look as it makes it look a bit glitchy, but also as they are thicker than nothing, they fill the page in, and it has less empty spots.
I also had to change the background colour back to white as the black looked off with the empty spaces in the background (of the image)

i like how this effect looks. i definitely like how there is more colour now with the books being the main focus.
