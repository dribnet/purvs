## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Theme: the coast

In this project, I hope to choose "coast" as my theme, and I choose three photos that I am satisfied with to express this theme and modify some parameters to make these photos look more detailed.
In the final project, I modified the mask into different animal shapes, so as to contrast the background picture with the mask and make the whole work more vibrant. On the pixel processing, I made it into the shape of ripples, which will echo the theme. In the mask treatment, I designed the Mosaic pattern to make it not so monotonous but more expressive.
