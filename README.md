## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

idea: a space inspired design where a planet and a moon eclipse the sun, which creates the outline of the letter

possible names:
spacecase
eclipsed

today I worked on the shooting star part of my alphabet. I made the star part more starburst-like, and madethe trail behind it have a gradient. I also played with the colour of the planet, and edited the shape of the moon. I thought it could be cool to use the skill I learnt while trying to figure out sine waves and create a moon that wasn't perfectly circular. Finally I neatened up my code and added in more comments, as well as changing the words displayed in ther exhibithion section (I chose space-themed words because I thought it could be fun to tie it into the theme).
