## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

Initially I started with a rough idea of what I wanted to achieve through my design. I wanted to do a roughly nordic viking style runes instead of a simple styled
copy of the english alphabet. However this style usually consists of a lot of lines and dots which I knew would go over the 20 parameter limit so I decided to use
arcs instead in order to condense the parameters and give a flow to the shapes of the runes. I then juxtaposed this with 2 straight lines to add tention and detail
to each of the forms, thereby allowing greater diversity between the letter forms. For the colour, I went with a blood red for the runes with a darker shade to add 
a shadow behind. For the background I used a dark grey with a red tint to match the colour of the font. I did this to add a savage viking note to the text thereby 
referencing the bloody history that the design is based around.
