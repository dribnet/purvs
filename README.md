This will be the first version of the clock.

My idea is to have 3 rings aligned vertically, 1 for hours, 1 for minutes, 1 for seconds, 
and with small circles rotating around each ring to indicate the specific unit's amount. 

In the drawing you can see that it says 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 6 seconds.

The "AM" & "PM" signs would be lit or dim based on what part of the day it is.
