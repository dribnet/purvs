## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Image 1:Played around with the spacing of the pixels and size of the ellipses a bit. Thought it would look a bit nice but it is quite hard to see. Could use the spacing on the background though. I think it would work well in some instances. Just made the spacing 15 by 15 and multiplied ellipse1 t_w by 2 and ellipse2 t_h by 2.

Image 2: Sketched on the mask a bit to see what would happen. Difference is not too noticeable unfortunately but I feel like I just need to adjust it a bit to make the background (black mask) and main focus (white mask) much clearer. Might either place with the sizes more or with the actual shapes themselves. Added the mask function and such.

Image 3:This seems to be a lot closer to what I had in mind. I should use the directions of the shapes to my advantage to show the difference clearly. I also changed the mask a Tiny bit on this one as well. Should think about how big the blobs of white and black should be since they overlap each other a lot. Will add actual pictures in the next update.
