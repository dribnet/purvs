## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

##Initial Theme

The images above are photos of various buildings around Wellington CBD. The masks which have been overlaid on top of each photo creates a new image/art work rather than highlighting a certain aspect of the building photos.

In order to tell the difference between the mask and the actual image, the mask has been algorithmically processed by rectangle shapes whilst the mask background or the actual image underneath, has been processed with ellipses.

To make the masked image a lot more evident (have a better outline), I added a translucent yellow fill on top of the masked image.

I think that this theme with having art/new image on top of an existing one will be a good theme to carry out throughout this project. It definitely needs further refinement but it is a good start so far.
