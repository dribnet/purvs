This is my final commit. I'm happy with how my code has turned out in the end, I think I have used colour quite well.
My form's represent bits of card cut into triangles and stuck with tape in place to represent letters and numbers. I have applied the rule that no triangles can be hanging in space and that they have to be either on the ground or taped. The triangles can be sitting on top of each other.
My idea changed from part commits a bit before my idea was called 'blacktape' and the concept was that triangles were being stuck in place by tape to form letters. It didn't make sense why my tape was black though apart from aesthetic reasons but I found switching to make my tape white actually made my letter forms look better and it was easier for the viewer to understand what my concept was.

What tripped me up a bit in this project was the amount of time it took to make my whole alphabet.
Next time I would try and keep my triangles's all the same area and see if I could make an alphabet from that.
