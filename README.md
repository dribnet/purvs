### Tree clock

I have added a for loop so that an ellipse is created each second for 60 seconds to represent the rings of the tree trunk. Then once 60 seconds have passed the rings dissapear and the rings then start counting again. To then show the minutes passing I have added arcs which will represent the trunk that is created over time, one for the minutes and one for the hour. Once 60s passes and the largest ellipse is created the arc changes shape to represent the minutes passing and hence after an hour the larger arc will also change shape.
