## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

FINAL README – MDDN 242 PS4: Custom Pixel - "Digital/Natural"
For this project I chose to use photos of nature as I thought it would provide an interesting juxtaposition against the digital art created by the custom pixel. Originally, I wanted photos that showed contrast between natural and man made elements around Wellington but I found it more interesting to see that contrast between the shapes created by the code and how they could distort the natural shapes in the photos.  This contrast created by the code filters tied in with the message I was hoping to communicate which is our society’s changing relationship with the environment. As a society we are simultaneously experiencing technological advances whilst gaining an increased awareness of the need to preserve our climate. I used a mask with black, white and grey to draw the image and then add detail in different passes. I wanted to make the images look like pixel art and I added the blocked out parts of the image and black outlines to add to the digital/cartoon style. I used this cartoon/pixelated style to highlight how it is easy to get disconnected from the importance of caring for our environment and how easy it is to ignore our responsibility to be as sustainable as possible.
