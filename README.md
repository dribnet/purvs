Alphabet Construction

This is my first attempt at building the fonts shapes from my code with the same paramters outlined in the Concept upload. I have added a question Mark and a fullstop just to round out the whole line nicely.I am fairly happy with the results so far however I am feeling a little limited to the shapes I can create with my current parameters and so I am considering adding a final parameter to control the x coordinate for the 3rd triangle. This will give me greater variety in the shapes I can create given that I will basically give myself an intirely new triangle to work with. I don't think it is going to be the easiest font to understand however it I aiming for abstract so I think that will be fine. I think I am really going to struggle with characters like the O, P, R as I don't have ideas for them yet.
