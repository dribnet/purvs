This README describes the matrix of randomised faces completed for task 3 

Face #1; and the design I am going to move forward with, is a parametric old man inspired by my baby face (#3).  The old man has configurable worry lines, mood, liver spots, glasses and ears. The liver spots parameter contains both scalar and discrete elements: the sketch will draw 1, 2, or 3 spots depending on the slider's value, and the spots will get progressively darker as the the value ramps up. The worry lines get darker & lighter. The man's mouth will curve up and down depending on the mouth parameter, and the size of his ears and the lenses of his glasses will change dependant on their respective variables.

The second face is a version of the Mario & Luigi sketch I made earlier. This version casts luigi aside (don't worry, he's used to it!) and draws our sewer-spelunking hero with some features mapped to four of the sliders:
	- Mousache slant
	- Pupil dilation
	- Moustache bushiness: modulates the size of the individual ellipses that make up the moustache. also modulates the size of mario's nose
	- Cheek chubbiness

I liked the art style that I used for my Mario. I thought that his cheeks made him look like a baby so I decided to make my next face that of a baby. I used 4 sliders for this onel giving control over:
	- nose size
	- cheek chub
	- mouth openness
	- 'alertness' when baby is tired he starts to drool and has trouble keeping his eyes open


In the third face I tried out a darker robot idea. This robot is always staring right at you and might have a wide or narrow head. His middle eye is a lazy eye.
