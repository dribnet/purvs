## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Iteration:
Testing with an image of a feather floating on a calm ocean. Experimenting with the use of a small mask and trying to refine the parameters of my noise to create more of a nicer looking and controlled noise based on parameters.

Based on this and the last commit I have done I have a better idea of how to create better looking noise and will probably not use images with a small focus point such as the feather in this image. I do think the colours in the image are interesting.

I think I have experimented enough I do however want to develop the code further but am unsure as to how currently and I will try to decide on which images I want to further refine into my final outputs that reference my narrative the best,
