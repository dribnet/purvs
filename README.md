I finally started looking at opacity, and I now realize that if I really wanted to play with opacity with my forms, I should have taken it into consideration in the early stages of the designing process. As shown in the sketch for this commit, opacity is truly effective if the colours and shapes created do not distract or take away from the rest of the form. While some of my forms do look interesting with their opacity lowered, the layering of the arcs in some of my forms do not look as good, especially with the letters i, l, r, s, t and x. With this revelation, I have decided to not alter the opacity of my letters, and instead focus on looking at different colour palettes as I am mostly happy with my letter forms. The designs for the letters f, i, j, r and s, as well as the number nine still need to be adjusted. 

The fourteen parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
