## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

This readme is for part 5.

In this final stage, I have setup the layout so it has a simple rotation to the right in rows so the faces can still be contrasted.
I have also set focusedRandoms for the colour of the face polygons so that not all poly iterations with the same number have the same colour.
However I have left the features colours as I want them to be seen so they need to be able to contrast.

Each face also has a custom height translation so the rows aren't static.

Over this project, I have learnt about parametisation in coding and how to manipulate these parameters to create recognisable visuals, in this case, faces.
