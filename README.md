I have completed the design of numbers as well as the alphabet today. Now it's time to put the code in so that the alphabet moves flexibly.



The fourteen parameters per letter:

triX1 : X1 offset of the triangle
triY1 : Y1 offset of the triangle
triX2 : X2 offset of the triangle
triY2 : Y2 offset of the triangle
triX3 : X3 offset of the triangle
triY3 : Y3 offset of the triangle
rectX : X offset of the rectangle
rectY : Y offset of the rectangle
rectW : Widh of the rectangle
rectH : Height of the rectangle
arcX : X offset of the arc
arcY : Y offset of the arc
arcS : Angle to start the arc
arcE : Angle to stop the arc
arcW : Width of the arc
arcH : Height of the arc
