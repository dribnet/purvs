Project One 

Digital Clock

This is my final version of my own clock, and I get inspiration from the sketch drawing and my favourite music EDM. 
Therefore, I make it look like more digitalised. And the background I make two different effects, one is similar to 
solar system and another is waving ellipses. I espacially like the waving, because it is like electronic music videos
after effect.During time changing, the background effect would be faded away. For the alarm, I make a noFill circle(black) in the outer of digital clock.
