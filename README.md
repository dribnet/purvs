## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

So I have adjusted my parameters. I removed a few because I actually didn't need them and now I have 6 parameters which is good.

Parameters (6):
  "wid": 50,
  "hei": 100,
  "b2offsetx": 130,
  "b2offsety": 210,
  "b3offsetx": 130,
  "b3offsety": 195

  I then incorporated my idea and colours onto the alphabet.js, playing around with the sizes and positions. 

  I think next I will maybe look at playing around with the colours, changing them. And also maybe looking at triangles inside the ellipses instead.
