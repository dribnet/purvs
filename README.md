## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process 

I wanted to experiment and compare. I knew that I wanted rectangles and squares so I wanted to see what the images would look like in slightly different style of uniform tiles. To show the difference between the background to the person in the images I playing with the stroke, so having the background the with a black stroke and then having my person have a white gap when the image was drawn. I really want the face itself to be highly visible and the tile look really shows that. 

For my theme I decided to stick with the same people in my inital images. I really like the idea of faces, emotion and expressions so I want to focus my theme around that for my final.
