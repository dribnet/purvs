Sketch Ideas Experiment Two - 11/05/20

I made some minor changes to the style of my letters. I changed the colour to green and I figured out the way to change the colour opacity in hex format.
This allowed me to make my code more efficient by inserting the veriables rather than using 'fill' and inserting the numbers.
It was also very easy to trasnfer my colour palette over to the draw_letters.js file!! :)

I also made some small parameter changes to my letter B and C. I did this just to refine my lettering style a bit more.  

The 14 parameters per letter:
 • "offsetx": 17, | x position for first rect (filled)
 • "offsety": 0, | y position for first rect (filled)
 • "rectlength": 28, | first rect length
 • "rectheight": 90, | first rect height
 • "nofill_length": 20, | second rect length (no fill)
 • "nofill_height": 82, | second rect height (no fill)
 • "rect_twoposx": 55,  | x position for second rect
 • "rect_twoposy": 4, | y position for second rect
 • "triangleleftx": 188, | tri first point x
 • "trianglelefty": 270, | tri first point y
 • "triangletopx": 228, | tri secong point x
 • "triangletopy": 198, | tri second point y
 • "trianglerightx": 266, | tri third point x
 • "trianglerighty": 270, | tri third point y
