## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This was a quick example of how i can change the pixel values and areas from the tutorial. I like this effect and think it would look cool for a themed photo with rain meaning. 

The images above are photos of my friend from an assignment from last year in the studio algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
