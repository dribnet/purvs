## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The Ocean Bloom

So today I actually did some work. During the weekend I will be taking some pictures that are related to what I'm after and and will be adding them to the actual index and adjusting the masks so that the pixels fit.

The new pixels are these star shapes and snowflakes to differentiate between the plants and the seas and the masks will be adjusted to fit. There will also be size adjustments to the snowflakes and possible shape change to the original star to show contrast between two elements.
