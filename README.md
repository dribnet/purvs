Practice Sketch 2

Each letter is composed of four ellipses and a rectangle. The size of the first two ellipses, the last ellipse and the rectangle have fixed sizes. The third ellipses size is controlled by a parameter. the location of all the shapes are controlled by a perimeter. 


The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
