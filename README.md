## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

This is my first change to the code. I changed the colour mode to RGB and HSB to get a combination of 'actual' colours and different colours. I also added a stroke to the squares to seperate the background from the bus.
