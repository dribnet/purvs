## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I've added a new photo because the cactus wasn't working well with my idea. It had no background or flowers. I want flowers to go with the theme of the importance of nature/bees but also to link to bees and the hexagons/honeycomb. I've also added in a bee which I want to be placed randomly in the image. It will be something for people to find within the image, I want it to show how bees are threatened. 

I only want one bee and I will need to make it smaller. The bee is covered by the other shapes which I don't want.
