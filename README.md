## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have tried to create a custom pixel that has a touch of floral elements while arranging the pixel in a grid formation so it remains structured. I have chosen to create masks that highlight the floral subject of the pictures. Next I will play around with inverting the masks as it might make the flowers stand out more if I have a patterned background.
