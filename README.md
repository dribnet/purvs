### Episode 03 About F&^%! Time

still sticking with the same concept of time
I have chosen the time/day clock, idea. Which involves a transitioning number and wallpaper depending on how the day has passed. so for example the colour of the time will change as it heads into night from black to white. This also works along with the wallpaper transitioning from day to night as well depending on the time.

general layout of the clock has been made, i just need to experiment further with how i can bring the changing wallpaper idea into motion with time.

your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
