### Super Clock Land

---

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time. Adhering roughly to the capabilities of the Super Game Boy, an add-on peripheral for the Super Nintendo.

---

#### Changes:
+ Tweaked some visuals

#### Current Issues:
+ Smaller circular shapes really break the illusion for palette swapping but that's probably unavoidable
+ Not really a clock yet

#### To Do:
+ Start actually implementing the scene
+ Nail down the colours
+ Implement z-ordering for scene objects!!

#### Notes:
+ Ocean currently does not use palette swapping scheme, though *technically* is still within the limitations of the SGB. That per-pixel function was simply never used in any commercial game.
