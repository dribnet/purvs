Each of my letters is composed of a grid of nine circles, a large circle, a square and a set of triangles. grid attempts outline a general shape of a character where the circle square and triangle are meant to be indicative of connecting lines curves and angles; and the general style of the character for example an S is curvy in profile so a circle is used to illustrate this, whereas a 5 has both angular and curvy elements so a square and circle are combined to denote this

The 12 parameters per letter:
  TL, TM, TR, ML, MM, MR, BL, BM, BR : controls the circle grid 
  "Square": controls the square
  "Circle": controls the circle
  "Triangle": controls the two triangles
