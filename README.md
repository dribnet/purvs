After some initial sketches for the rest of my alphabet, I decided to change the rectangle in my letters to another arc, as I thought that having all my shapes as arcs would look more interesting, especially as I started looking at letters like g, w and m. In order to help myself visualize that approach, I began to start adding new code to the letters and draw_letters files. However, I then decided to update my sketch so that I could have a preview of my new idea before I tried to design the whole alphabet in the same manner. In order to minimize the number of parameters that I have, I am planning to keep the width and height of all my arcs at 80, as I do not want to increase the number of my parameters. I realized that by replacing the rectangle with an arc, that the distinction between the stem of the letter and the rest of the form could be a little more difficult to differrentiate. However I am very ineterested to continue with this idea, as this would translate better design-wise, when I start experimenting with opacity.

The fourteen updated parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
