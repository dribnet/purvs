UPDATED README!!

This is the final version of the part 2 exercise. I reused both of my previous characters as I thought they had good potential for parameterized values, and included a new character called Flabebe, which is also a Pokemon. 

I wanted to experiment with giving each parameterized slider a different value to change throughout each character. The main exception to this is the discrete value with does something similar between all characters. (This was because I wanted to adjust something that wasn't an eye blink, but couldn't think of anything else)

The first slider changes rotation, rectangle border, and scale.
The second slider holds all discrete variables.
The third slider adjusts pupil scale, eye gleam position, and ear position. (The ears are asymmetrical because I found it more natural than the symmetrical version.)

At this point I thought about which kind of style I would like to use and take into part 3. I decided on Zamasu because I felt like I enjoyed working on him the most, and his face has a lot of complexity and space to add more adjusting variables.

I used the fourth and fifth slider to experiment with him further. 

The fourth slider has a lerpColour value associated to it, which changes between the regular green, to a light pink. I wanted to see how colour changes would work. And finally the fifth slider adjusts his bottom jawline, this was to begin testing varying head shapes.
