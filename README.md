## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

At this point in the project I have drawn most of my alphabet and added some rudimentary transitions. Even though these transitions look pretty cool they're not what I set out to make for this project so finding some way to create a transition more like my initial sketches or something like a [flip clock](https://www.petervis.com/Radios/8fc-59w/flip-clock-mechanism/flip-clock-mechanism-with-motor-removed.gif). You might be able to notice a little bit of a red and blue drop shadow on each of the pixels, That's because I am trying to make the text look a lot more like a retro computer screen. I have been experimenting with some noise and blur filters but to no success so far. I will update when I can add some better 'effects'.
