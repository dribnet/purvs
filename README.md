## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Part 1: Testing if I can access and run ps3 code properly

The first image shown is my first attempt at working with the code. I tried experimenting how my mask will work with my image as I have used different brushes to create the mask. The code seems fairly straight forward and I can see that I have a lot of opportunities to experiment.

This first image is the side exterior wall of the National Aquarium of NZ that I have taken. I really like looking at murals and piece of art scattered around the places I've visited in NZ, all though I am not sure if this will be the theme I will be focusing on. In the next updates I will be experimenting with other photos I have taken.
