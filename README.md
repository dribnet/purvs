I began testing different features and aspects that could make the landscape more interesting. One of them was stroke, which helps highlight the regions apart from each other, as with the transparent overlays they might blend into each other too much. 

I dont think Ive mentioned it yet, but I was going for an Island in the water type of landscape, where there is deep water, shallow water, land, steeper land/ hills, and if you're lucky enough a volcano top. 

To help identify these points of land better, the lower the tile is (deep water or shallow water), the ellipses around that area are smaller, while the higher tiles such as the high land, or volcano top have larger ellipses.
