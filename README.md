Added new interpretation of maeda clock.

I based the design on the 9th clock shown, however i decided to experiment with the colour used and replaced the edge with pink. This creates a more neon glow effect which i think makes it look more a little more vivid.

### Outrageous clock

Describe the idea for your clock here - replacing this text.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your 
image above. You can also include
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
