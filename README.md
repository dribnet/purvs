## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

After refining some of the letters I did not like I realised I was putting all of the elements within my constant red triangle. I decided this looked way better and so I decided to do this for all of my letters. I am really happy with how a lot of them have turned out. My favourites at the moment are A, D, K, L, N, R, U V, X, Z. 

I also worked on my default character because that did not properly represent my font earlier so i decided two simple triangles in a diamond formation in both directions showing different options that the letterform might go to. It also doesn't look like any of the other forms and I wouldn't say it is recognisable as a letter number.

I have realised my design is still based on a graphic font that designers can use on typgraphy or graphic based designs. However my letters are more based on the energy and sounds that the letters give rather than their tradtional appearance in the English alphabet. Hence, some of them are not the most readable because to me they represent a bit of a different vibe or energy to the mainstream letterform. I would say N, H, Y, Q, S, K and B represent this idea the most. Others do like similar to their mainstream counterpart but it still represents how I imagine the letter. 

I have also been able to clean up the appearance of a lot of them and make sure there are less irregularities and it is more cohesive. I have been referencing back to the exhibition so I can see what they look like and make design decisions from then on. So far I am pretty happy with how it is coming together but I am worried for how they will interact with one another.  


Here are my parameters for each letter so far - each letter may have different set of paramaters but every letter or digit only has 12 parameters.
   "triX1": first x point of first triangle
   "triY1": first y point of first triangle
   "triX2": second x point of first triangle
   "triY2": second y point of first triangle
   "triX3": third x point of first triangle
   "triY3": third y point of first triangle


   "2triX1": first x point of second triangle
   "2triY1": first y point of second triangle
   "2triX2": second x point of second triangle
   "2triY2": second y point of second triangle
   "2triX3": third x point of second triangle
   "2triY3": third y point of second triangle

   "3triX1": first x point of third triangle
   "3triY1": first y point of third triangle
   "3triX2": second x point of third triangle
   "3triY2": second y point of third triangle
   "3triX3": third x point of third triangle
   "3triY3": third y point of third triangle
