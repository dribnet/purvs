## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
 I've had more of a play with my images to make them a bit more abstract, and really deliver more on the digital side. I loved the look of the fluoresent colours in my last commit, but thought I could use them a little more to bring more of the digital side through. I've also spent some time playing with rotating the rects that make up the bacgkround pxiels. It's been a whole lot of experimenting and currently they're looking very wacky but also interesting, however I feel I'm losing a little bit of the nature side. I'm having a little bit of difficulty with perfecting what sort of rotation look I'm after. I'm going to keep playing for now.

With my third input I had finally mastered using grey masks in the background to bring a third element, I am now going to work on using this in input 1 & 2 to develop my images a bit more.
