30/03	My letterforms work by having each parameter correspond with one point of each triangle. 2 triangles = 12 parameters per letterform. This is going to be a difficult concept when drawing letters which have three stems (uppercase E, M, W etc).
I have successfully managed to put my letters into the editor.js. This has made experimenting with letterforms a lot faster and more efficient. When my first rough draft of an alphabet is complete, I'll have to consider how I'm using negative space, whether it is consistent, and having the numbers use the black triangle as the dominant in the form.
