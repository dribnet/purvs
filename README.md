## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

The main thing I've gotten done is I've fully fixed up my interpolation so all the letters work. The problem I was having was when I first wrote out all the letters if I wasn't using a parameter I just wouldn't have it in my letter data. The result was that when I transitioned between my letters some parts of the letters would transition while other parts would just appear and disappear. At first I couldn't think how to fix the problem but yesterday I realized I could just make the value of all the unused parameters zero and they would either appear from the sides or in the case of the center square, grow in the middle. I felt very silly for not thinking of this fix sooner. I did have to set the hight values to 100 because I'm drawing all my lettes in squares at the bottom of the mini canvases.
The other thing I've fixed up is I went over all my letters and changed any I didn't like. There were a few letters that I didn't have great solutions for when they were first written that I could come up with better ideas for now that I've worked with the code more. I've been watching the exibition to see which letters look out of place. I've changed the 2, 8, c, g, and j. I'm a bit dislexic and I only realized yesterday that the 2 was backwards the whole time. 
I've also put the name of the font, my name, and my birthday into the swap letters. I talked some about the font name in the last readme and I'll discuss it more in my final so I probably don't need to dive in now.
The plan for tomorrow is to go over everything and make sure I'm all up to date, set up my perview, and write up my final readme! I feel like I'm right on track and I hope my font is well recived!
