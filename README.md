## Polishing

I have been polishing my design by adjusting the way I draw the letters to make smoother animations and choosing the first words of the exhibiton that suit my theme and show off nice letters. I chose the name "autumnal" for my font as it is the central theme of my design. I also adjusted the height of all my letters by 50 so they will be centered in the exhibition but still in-line.

I currently have 13 parameters;
	"offsetx": X position of the first leaf
    "offsety": Y position of the first leaf
    "leaf2Posx": X position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "leaf2Posy": Y position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "rotate1": rotation angle of the first leaf
    "rotate2": rotation angle of the second leaf
    "rotate3": rotation angle of the stick
    "stickPosx": X position of the stick in relation to first leaf
    "stickPosy": Y position of the stick in relation to first leaf
 	"circlex": X position of the negative space circle in relation to first leaf
    "circley": Y position of the negative space circle in relation to first leaf
    "circlew": width of the negative space circle circle
    "circleh": height of the negative space circle circle
