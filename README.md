Block Alphabet

This code is just my 'A'. 'B', and 'C' drawn out because I haven't figured out how to use the correct code yet, but this shows what I am trying to achieve.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
