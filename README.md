## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

The alphabets are expressed in braille on the bottom half of the domino tile.
The numbers are expressed in the normal domino way, on both the top and bottom half of the domino tiles.
There are 11 dots, and each of the dots' colour can be changed in letters.js. By changing the colour the dots can appear and disappear depending on the alphabet and number.

I decided not to use braille alphabet on the dominos and instead I coloured the dots to make it look like alphabet fonts.
I have made the color interpolate between black and white.
