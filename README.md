PART 1: Iterative Pattern (Wallpaper)

I have used a series of for loops to generate my tiling patern for part 1 of assignment 3. I tried to design something that could not only be infinitely tiled but would look good at different scales (small diamonds or large diamonds). I narrowed the colours down to just two - which could be interchanged depending on the colours you wanted for your fabric, or to have as wallpaper in your room - as well as playing with stroke opacity for the final effect. 

I have now also added 3 sliders that can be used to adjust the wallpaper to change the diamond size, ellipse size, and shade. However, this meant needing to remove the noLoop(); which has impacted the performance.
