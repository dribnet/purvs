Previously, the expressions on the faces were all random, but the faces themselves were all identical. I've now added a few randomized parameters to allow for some variation in face shape (particularly the curve of the cheeks and pointiness of the chin), as well as skin color. I've kept skin color completely random, as I didn't want to favour any one tone but rather have a range of different ones for the program to choose from. 

I still need to add variation to the eye color, but am now quite satisfied that the faces look like different people and not just variations on the same.
