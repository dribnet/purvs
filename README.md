### Solar System Clock

For my clock i have decided to take the solar system as inspiration. 

As a basic concept i will have 3 planets orbiting a sun, each planet will represent a unit of time (hours, minutes, seconds, possibly all the way to years)
and their point in the orbit will be based on their time.
