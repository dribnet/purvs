## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Building on the last version these outputs distinguish the people more from the background using some white lines to highlight them. The grid of ellipses that make up the people has been expanded and randomized to both highlight the people but also make their features harder to work out, hopefully making you look at the image longer.

The theme I am going with at the moment is friends and family as they are an important part of my life and deserve to be captured and showcased. I aim to highlight them by making the background a clear secondary component in the output. Permission has been granted for use of them in my photographs :)

Currently, each image has a custom mask made by me, 3 tones (Black, white, grey) and is processed with a grid of ellipses for the subject and the horizontal lines for the background.

The Code Is now more complex and still a bit messy - will work on.
