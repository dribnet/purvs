Testing Different Colour Palettes
    
  It was interesting trying different colours for the lines and what worked wwell. My inspiration for my alphabet is the television static - its colours and the effect it has when layered when transparent. My inspiration is not really noticable when the colour palette strays away from the static colours. But I really like the look of the other colour palettes, because they have a tropical vibe. Since I have experimented with other colour palettes I am favouring the tropical colours more. It looks more refreshing and they tend to work better together more than the normal static colour palette I have originally used. If I do end up using the tropical themed colour palette, I'd say my final alphabet's concept is a tropical television static.
