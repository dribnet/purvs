## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I want to use a face to represent the alphabet. I also am using the position on the page to represent the melody/pitch of the alphabet song. 

My face is so far too simple. I need more detail to be able to make the face more expressive. 

Ideas for detail: 
mouth lines,
changing eye shape/ location, 
teeth boolean? 
tounge ? 
some idea of lip position? 


Still no idea of how I will do numbers.
