## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

This is a refinement of part 2 merged with the new code. It is much easier now to have different angles of the face taken into account. 

To improve my design I added more detail to the chin and mouth. I also am thinking about what variables I want to have changeable later on. For example, their is now going to be an option to have different eye colours. There is more detail in the eyebrows too so that the faces don't always look so indifferent like before.
