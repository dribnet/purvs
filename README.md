Interaction

Since I used a lot of rotations when creating the letters, the letters are able to rotate during the interaction. Also, the arrow can appear from different angles. However, the problem is that some parts of the letters appear outside the box during the interaction. I have tried to fix it, but it doesn't look good either. But at least it is possible to change from the old letters to the new ones .
