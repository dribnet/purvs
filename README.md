## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have added my own image of 'Bart' and rendered it using the program we were given, I have also experimented with images of birds but the rendering took too long due to the high level of detail. I have also added a picture of 'Rick' and a picture of a pizza on my phone,now im going to experiment with my own choice of pictures.
