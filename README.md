I have now finished all letters, numbers and made a symbol. I changed it so now that the triangles all have no fill. I also made new rules. One being that if two triangles are symmetrical, they must overlap. Another rule is if a side of a triangle touches another side of a triangle, then the triangle that is not the base of the shape, must cross over to the next side of the base shape. The only time it canâ€™t cross is if a point is touching a side of a triangle. I plan on renaming my parameters so they are easier to decipher.

Parameters per letter:

V1x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle 1.
V1y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle 1.
V2x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle 1.
V2y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle 1.
V3x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle 1.
V3y : y position of vertex 3 on triangle 1.
V4x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle 2.
V4y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle 2.
V5x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle 2.
V5y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle 2.
V6x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle 2.
V6y : y position of vertex 3 on triangle 2.
V7x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle 3.
V7y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle 3.
V8x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle 3.
V8y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle 3.
V9x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle 3.
V9y : y position of vertex 3 on triangle 3.
