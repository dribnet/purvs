## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Read me for Karen O'Brien's Parametric alphabet

For this project I want to create a retro/ geometric inspired alphabet. I also want to use transparency to create depth when different shapes overlap (examples in mood board). While the shapes this alphabet is composed of are relatively simple, effective colour and movement, as well as having an overall sense of cohesiveness will be the main goal.

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
