## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


I went back to using smoothed lines in some areas, the larger pieces have smoothed edges which help to round the entire piece out, without creating too jarring of a mix between the smaller tiles. 
Ive also added some depth to each tile, to try simulate the look of glass. I added a duplicate quad of each tile, over the top of the original. Its white with a low opacity so it slightly lightens the colour, making it appear shaded around the edges. 

I also reworked my mask, adding another size variation to the mosaic tiles as there needed a smoother blend over the face. 

To properly convey the visual of a stained glass window i scripted in a static frame, that is positioned around the edges of each image. This is just hard coded and entirely static, the colour on each is slightly transparent however so you can still see the edges/colours beneath. I added an overlay of each frame line, of a lighter colour, making the frame seem slightly more 3D. 

With this done i also modified the code of the background (the green rings) again. One of my input pictures had a white object in the background towards the top, and it created a really nice affect of light shining down on the portrait. To slighly simulate this ive modified the background script so that it gets lighter as the rings spread out, creating a subtle halo of light around her. 


When i started this project i tried to think about a message i wanted to send, or something i wanted to show, given a public platform. The only message i could really think that i would want to convey is that I just really love my mum. My goal with this piece was to turn her into a living saint, by turning photos of her into stained glass windows.
