## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

I've set up 4 properties to be adjusted using the sliders. These are 'Head Shape' (the top shape making up the face - judged on forehead height), 'Jaw Shape' (the lower shape making up the face - judged on jaw width), 'Mouth Shape' (whether the mouth is happy or sad/indifferent - judged on whether the face appears to be smiling or not), and 'Cheek Colour' (this colour lerps between two shades of pink/red where the lighter they are, the more feminine the face, and the darker the more masculine).

I've now gone through all of the training faces, and adjusted all these slider properties for each face.
