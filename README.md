#update 
Redone the draw face to be more complete and better scale/looking nicer.
I used a sketch and photoshop to map the correct scale still need to do alot of polishing up on the human skull outline. will need to draw teeth to make the skull look right.

#plan

Human and Ram skulls

Ram Skulls {
	vectors and curves:
	vectors for face shape
	curves for horns
	bone details would be annoying
}
Human skulls{
	vectors to create shape.
	vectors for bone details
	bone details would be hard
}
randomise{
	number of eyes{
					1 - 6?
					face size will need to scale to fit eyes
					}
	size of horns{
					length or curl maybe both
					need to be an algorithm
				}
	colour{
			white, grey, black
			skin instead of bone then - white, grey, brown, black 
			}		
	width/length of face
} 
simplify{
	dont draw teeth
	top half of skull/face only e.g no jaw
	outlines and fill colours
}
if eyes >2 length = x 

variables:
	- vector points for scaling height and width
	- colour values
	- number of eyes
	function variables:
		- eyes call as required
		- horns call types of horns/scale

bone effects could be created by strokeWidth. 

make functions for the eyes. can randomise colours
make functions for types of horns which can scale for face size.

draw stock face functions so sizes can be scaled/made thinner or wider. longer/shorter.
ram skull and human skull as own functions.
