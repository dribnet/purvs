I have added variables to my fire face. 
Depending on the hair lightness the opacity of the back fire layers and the blackness of the eyebrows will map accordingly. 
The front layer will map its opacity to the skin colour shade.
Then the colour of the fire can be altered as well as the colour of the eyes.
