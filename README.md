## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one


23rd March:
today I played around with creating ideas for the letters A,B and C for my alphabet. I am leaning towards a abstract concept but my mind is still open to other ideas, more research and inspiration research is something that i'll do before next class.

25th March:
ive had a fresh look at my idea and ive began to realise i really hate it, the only thing i like about it is the colour but depending on the style of font that i will go for the colour may change.

29th  March:
finally decided on a fot style that i like, its simple, but i like it and i think its just abstract enough to be legible but also nice to look at

29th March:
i have issues with commiting my work on to github it doesnt seem to be working properly

30th March:
we managed to fix the problems with the drawing of the alphabet and now i can carry on with the alphabet
