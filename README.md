## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today Ive been able to fix my mask layers, I don't think I will use it in my final outcome just because there is a lot happening in the image otherwise. I am still yet to fix my code so it keeps wanting to 'grow'. I think for my 2nd output, I like the simplicity of using only two layers of the mask, It ultimatly comes down to less is more!

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
