## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I experimented a bit more with the zooming and also changed the background colour, which gives the image a different feel. I want to next play around with creating new elements with different shapes other than ellipses. For example when you zoom in, the very middle of the flower shape is a cross style shape so I think it would be cool to move onto a retangular/cross-style element so it looks like you are moving deeper and deeper into the flower. I think the overlapping is more effective on a black background, but I may look at changing the background colour only on specific zoom levels. 

I also need to add some animation, and I want to play around with randomising colour to add more complexity and detail to the overall grid.
