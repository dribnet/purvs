## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I used the basic interpolate function as a base for starting my animation. I then changed it so that the lines wouldn't move or tilt if they have a length of 0 in the old or new letter. I also decided to make the ring become a full circle before switching to the new arc angles. When the animation is half complete, the ring will be a brighter colour and fades in/out of that colour during the rest of the animation.
