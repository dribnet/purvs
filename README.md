### Spiral Clock
Sketch-1: I started off with some basic and strange concepts of clocks. These clocks were going to display the second hours and minutes in different ways likeflashing lights or using faster and slower rotations to show the difference between hours, minutes and seconds. I also looked at the different inspiration ideas given by the lecturer,but I found that most of the ideas i came up with wouldnt work for me so I stuck to one of my origional ideas which was the spiral shape.
Sketch-2: This page was basically just going through the ideas given by the lecturer and a little bit of development on the spiral idea. I looked at more traditional spiral shapes thatthe Maori used like the koru pattern trying to decide what would look best and would work with the triple design I am looking a doing. I felt like going down a more traditional methodwould look best with the type of spiral design that Im doing, but I needed to find a type of spiral that could work with having hours, minutes and seconds in the design.
Sketch-3: The third page of sketches was still looking at different types of spirals but in more depth, I feel like I like either the last or second to last for the final because theycan display the numbers more clearly. The dotted spiral one could work best if coded right, but it may be harder for the user to view/look at due to lack of numbers but they can alwaysbe added in.

Note:
Make sure to open up preview and open "View Sketches" to see the 3 pages of concepts and developments.
