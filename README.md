## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Today, I have played around more with my design, I really want to challenge myself using code variables that I don't normally use, I've started off with arch and triangle as I don't have a clear direction on what I want to do with my design, I think I want to play around with morse code or braile and the idea that variations of patterns create different letters


The parameters per letter:

  * `redoffsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `redoffset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `redoffset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `redoffset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one

  *	`opacity` : Colour opacity

  * `yellowoffsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `yellowoffsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `yellowoffset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `yellowoffset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `yellowoffset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `yellowoffset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one
