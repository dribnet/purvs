## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The start

I spent about two weeks to explore the field of image processing both in p5js and processing. After I gained deeper understanding of it, I was going to think about custom pixels.

The first step is how to locate each pixel in the image. Definitely, there is a way offered in the example file. I also have learned another way to locate the pixel in image.

Then, I roughly create different shapes for the pixels to take a glance of the visual effect.

By the way, I was thinking of the animation effect for this project. I am betting that would be cool. surely, in this case, I have tried sorts of methods to figure it out.

The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
