## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I was looking through a magazine one day and saw people holding the tools of their trade, always facing the camera. Always prominently showing the person and their trade or hobby clearly. I wanted to take these things and obscure them as much as possible. Anton, smoking his weed out front of his band's lockout, and Marie in front of the graffiti that she loves so much. I felt these images put more of the mystery on the person rather than the object, while at the same time dissolving the ego.  

In the final version the fading out of the masked person did not quite work as well as I had hoped. I just could not quite achieve the gradual precision in the fade with rectangles when the image got the high resolution version. Thus negating much of my efforts to rotate and transform the pixels. The effect simply did not scale, and the incremental rotation I originally put it made it worse. However it did achieve an interesting effect with the man in white and his boot collection. I think going back I would try and work with larger shapes and perhaps mess around with a bit of transparency in those overlaping shapes. 

I may run some off in medium quality in the future to see if I can achieve a happy medium.
