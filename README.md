Each of my letters is composed with four triangles. each point of my triangles are controlled by 6 parameters each.


The parameters for one of the triangles are:

  * `offsetx1 tri 1` : x offset of the first triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety1 tri 1` : y offset of the first triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsetx2 tri 1` : x offset of the second triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety2 tri 1` : y offset of the second triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsetx3 tri 1` : x offset of the third triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety3 tri 1` : y offset of the third triangle point relative to the center

  this is the same for the other 3 triangles with different offset values

  I have currenlty only done the code for A, B and C and these are in the sketch window.

  My preview is the sketch I have drawn of all the letters and how I am going to make them look
