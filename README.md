## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

-29/5-
I am using three images taken from around Wellington. I still need to work on a cohesive theme across the images.
I played around with the grid that is drawn in the masked areas. I increased the size of the squaress a little and tried out over-saturating, de-saturating and having greyscale squares. The first two images above I used de-saturation (to 35%), the third image is at full color/saturation as that looked best with this image.
I am pretty happy with how my code distorts the images so I wil just work on finding/taking some photos with a theme in mind fro the final product.

I have found a couple of photos that I have taken from around Wellington, my third image is still the rainbow gradient to test out different ideas easier.
My algorithm still draws ellipses, squares and triangles. They get smaller over time and the shape depends on the lightness value of the point in the image. 
I have now implemented a mask in which a greyscale grid is drawn in the masked areas, it took me a long time to workout how to draw both a grid and a random pattern but I got it to work inthe end.
I will now work on tweeking different parameters to finalise my design.

I am still using the same images as i haven't found final images to use yet, although I have changed the third image from the black and white gradient to a ranbow gradient so I could test my sketch easier and see different effects my code had.
The algorithm draws ellipses, squares and triangles. The shape that is drawn depends on the value of the colour from each point that is picked, so ellipses are a third of the colour space, squares the next third and triangles the last third. The shapes also still shrink over time which I think makes a nice layered affect where you can sometimes see bigger shapes that haven't been covered. The shapes also have a random rotation value to add some visual differences and prevent a grid-like appearance 
I have tried out a masking effect where the masked area draws in greyscale, I have used a simple circle in the middle of the canvas for all the images to test it out. I like the effect and will play around with maybe just desaturating the colours or inverting them next.

Im not sure what sort of theme I want to go with for the images yet, as placeholders to play around with I used a render from a previous project, a picture from a game that i happened to have on my USB and the same Te Aro campus photo as before. 
I removed the mask on my first two images, I want to play around with colour and try have over or under saturation in the masked area. 
For the algorithim I have the ellipses draw and get smaller over time, they start out quite large then draw smaller and smaller which slowly adds in extra detail to the image and creates a nice layered effect. the ellipses also have a range when they draw so that they pick a random size between two values (which get smaller over time).
