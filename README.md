For this section, my main focus was plugging in my code from the letters.js file into the editor, and to see how I could interact with the parameters. This was an interesting experiment, especially after I started seeing interesting ways to use my arcs to create patterns and shapes.  

The fourteen parameters per letter:
"arcW" : width of all arcs
"arcH" : height of all arcs
"arcX" : x position of arc 1
"arcY" : y position of arc 1
"arcS" : starting point of arc 1
"arcE" : ending point of arc 1
"arcX2" : x position of arc 2
"arcY2" : y position of arc 2
"arcS2" : starting point of arc 2
"arcE2" : ending point of arc 2
"arcX3" : x position of arc 3
"arcY3" : y position of arc 3
"arcS3" : starting point of arc 3
"arcE3" : ending point of arc 3
