I added the brick wall inception. It lags crazily after zoom 6 so I don't think I can put too much more detail into it. So far, I'm happy with the result.

zoom 0 : brick wall with window
zoom 1 : window sill detail, moon
zoom 2 : stars twinkling animation
zoom 3 : wall/building shows up
zoom 6 : brick wall & window inception
