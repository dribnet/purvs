## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Taking the code given to us, I have replaced the source images with that of art depicting futuristic cities, due to the wide range and contrast of colours in each image.

I have added code that draws the images based on a gird, so each point fits perfectly next to each other, creating a smooth mosaic effect.
