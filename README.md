Maskerade.

Pun intended. I am almost content with the masks I have and the code here. I will begin finalizing everything and preparing for the hand in.

I feel like the mixture of pixels and glitched lines really capture how fragmented and disassociated the world can be when one begins to fall into a mental health spiral. Even though there is colour, they are limited in palette. Even though there is sight, it is disfigured and cautious.
