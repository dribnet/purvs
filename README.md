## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I used the smartmask in the first and third image. I had to remove the second mask because they don't make sense together since the second mask was supposed to be an outline of the first mask. I did my masks differently than the smartmask, the black and white are swapped so I needed to take this into account and change it in my code.

The masks aren’t very precise. They don’t look as nice as my other ones which give the nice outline of the flowers I'm looking for, so I won't be using the smart mask.

It didn’t find anything for the second image and thought the third image (a rose) was a cake.
