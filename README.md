Colour iteration 

I actually like this colour, I tried different colour combination with the ivory bricks but I think the reddish bricks colour looks better when trying to add more colour to the composition. I quite like this one. I take back what I said about not liking some of the colour combinations (I think this one is successful)

Overall, I found this project much more challenging than the previous problem sets we had because of the difficulty on wrapping my head around the coordinate system. I didn't realise how technical the coordinate system was and in my sketch I thought of a difficult idea (my initial gustav klimt inspired abstract pattern). I soon realised that I wasn't going to be able to achieve that idea so I decided to extend my ps3 concept.

The brick tiling is drawn within the grid system whereas I thought it looked tacky/ redundant to have the windows within the grid system repeating itself. So, I decided to choose to put the windows outside of the replicating grid (centre of the page) so that the viewer knew where to focus on. As it zoomed, I wanted it to reveal little details with each zoom so that the viewers had incentive to keep zooming.

zoom 0 : brickwall, window and floating clouds
zoom 1 : window detail is revealed, moon is added
zoom 2 : twinkling stars are revealed 
zoom 3 : tiny square is revealed (supposed to be as if it is viewed from out the window)
zoom 6 : tiny square is actually a smaller version of the same brick wall with the window
zoom 7 : the brick wall that is far away actually has the same windows/ moon

My wall inception idea would have been more effective if I could do 2 wall reveals but after zoom 6, it became super laggy to the point where it was almost impossible for the viewer to look around. I decided to just settle with the 1 wall reveal.
