I have now fixed the triangles in every shape. Each letter now has the unused triangles hidden in the rectangles with no characters having shapes out of the border of the base rectangle. This means when you watch the shapes move you can see where each one goes. This makes it look cleaner and also make more sense to watch.

My next step is to read through the brief to make sure I am not missing anything important.
