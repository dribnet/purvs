### Clock Update


I have updated the clock to now show the minutes like I had originally planned, the final output will be pretty abstract but it will show time passing which is what I was going for with my clock idea. I am still undecided on the hour hands so I just have a placeholder in for now which is the little horizontal dashes that follow the minute hand. For the alarm I think I will introduce color or maybe change the orientation of the lines.
