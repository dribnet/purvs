## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

So this version is probably the final major content update. The interaction is finally done, that involves a quick colour fade out and in to simulate a light turning off and on. I also resized the letters by a tiny bit as the glow was outside of the boundaries, and adjusted the positions of the characters that weren't centered in the box. Finally I added the complete set of words to the exhibition, they are "NEONTYPE", "HI WORLD",  "MDDN 242" with NEONTYPE being the name of the font, since the whole alphabet was inspired by neon signs.

From here I will just be tidying up the code and updating the purview file.

Paramters are:
  - lines : an array of 1s and 0s that let the line algroithm know whether or not to "light up" or "turn on" a particular line
  - red : Contains the amount of red
  - green : Contains the amount of green
  - blue : Contains the amount of blue
