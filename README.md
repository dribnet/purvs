### Old clock

I have finally decided on my idea for my clock. I will still use the idea od how time was kept in the past. I will however use the idea of a cockoo clock with the weights moving up and down in corellation with the time changing on the clock. I will also try and have a bird pop out when the alrm goers off like a cockoo clock.
