## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Moved the sketch code to draw_letters.

Updated this code so it fit into the bounding boxes of draw_letters

Made the editor functional, updated the html file to read the parameters easier. I find this really useful.

Unsure if using sine waves is "complex" enough for it to be cool.

I think instead of toggling if wave 2 should be active, it should always be. The second wave might need to be there if it's switching from a 1 wave letter to a 2 wave letter.

Found an issue with the editor, I can't copy the code in the dialog box. Fixed it by getting Firefox but I would prefer to use Chrome.

I couldn't remember how to update the page so it shows the alphabet instead.
