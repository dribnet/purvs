## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Everything is all done, by the alphabet and numbers now. Took me longer to do so due to being unwell but I am finish, now is just the polishing, refining stage and the interaction stage. Also placed the bits that aren't showing behind the ones that are. Before they were set to just 0. That only worked for the circles for the yellow lines had to hid a bit different, since I made one yellow line go horizontally and one vertically, there I had to had them behind the red lines but had to change the size of the horizontal one, so that it didn't poke out.

Will most likely fix up some numbers at the end but, so far I like how they look.
