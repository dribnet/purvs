## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I edited the background code that I used last time and added more ellipses and some rectangles to make the background seem blurrier.

I also added a small ellipse to the center of each ellipse that is drawn in the eye to make it look almost like an iris in the eye. I have been trying to use curves to create small eyes that fill the eye mask which would make my final image more interesting to look at and give it more detail. I am still trying to figure this out. 

Not sure what else I could do with my image. I want to try and come up with more meaningful glyphs to fill the masks that relate to my theme but I am not sure what else I could do apart from the eye glyph.
