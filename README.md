## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

A series of obscured portraits of people I met while in France. The masks I am going to create will highlight edges and large spots of similar color. Like the edges with the Anton picture. I will probably play with the grid spacing and design of the lage areas of flat or dark colors to help bring out the highlights. For now I just have the default algorithm running while I finalize selection of my 3rd image and creation of its mask.
