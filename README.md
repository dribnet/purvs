For this part of the project, I started by taking some of my code from Creating Coding II where I generated spheres with waves determining an offset on the radius.
This generates interesting shapes that are extremely fluid and mesmerising to look at.

I am quite interested in how sin/cos waves work through interference etc, and different ways that we can use it to show more organic and reactive movement over time in designs.

This piece moved onto generating a grid of moving shapes, all driven by the same base interval so that they line up in the time domain. I started with rendering it with lines and tracers, which looked much like a mandela when the shapes were big enough, but ended up changing it to be a checkerboard fill pattern so that the edges of different objects overlap and create interesting complexity. I also made the largest sizes of shape loose some opacity so that the viewer gets to look into the innards every now and then.

This piece required a lot of iteration, but I am happy with the result and how it looks very simple at first glance but exhibits an interesting and organic movement when time is spent being mesmerized by it.
