## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I forgot to mention on the previous commit that I used the editor to create the letterforms. It wasn't accurate at times for some reason. I suspect because of the rotation and flipping and how it can get to be weird values at times. However, the values were an easy fix and using the editor was still a crucual step in starting off the letterforms. 

Besides that, this commit is really dedicated to the interaction between the letterforms. I have adjusted the position of some letterforms within the boundary box to hopefully mitigate kerning issues in the exhbition. Such as in the case of the 'p' and the 'y', they are shifted slightly to the right because they were often followed with wider letterforms like 'm'. I have added my own words and thought about naming the font 'quartz' because it features many of the stranger letterforms in a pleasant way.
