## Artificial Painting

My original idea was to use a mask that consists of a great deal of noise rather than large block images in order to "randomize" where different brush strokes show up. This would create a somewhat realistic looking paint-like effect. The original idea with the noisy mask didn't quite work however. So, in this current version, I've set up another way to somewhat randomize the placement of the brush strokes by using a variable "t" that counts up each frame to a max value of 7, where each value paints a different type of brush stroke, before reverting it's value back to 1.

I've created a "mask" type set of images in order to include layering of the paint so that I can have different levels of detail, and have rendered one image using it (artwork_2). The code is now working, I need to make some tweaks, however, to the values in order to get the detail that I'm looking for. I also want to create a proper black and white mask that will change the way the image looks, I have a few ideas about what the mask will do to the image, but I haven't quite decided yet.
