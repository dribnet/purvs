## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Yesterday I took photos of billboards/ advertising around town. I looked for ones that were advertising products rather than a bank or insurance company.

Today I chose some photos that I think had a nicer composition and good billboard/ advertisement placement and resized them then put them into my project folder. 

I chose an eye for the mask because Phoebe showed me some of the Great Gatsby posters. I thought the eye could represent how advertisements are targeted towards certain consumers and how they try to manipulate you into buying their products.

The output images didn't work as well as I had planned. I think the eye mask needs to be a lot bigger in the second and third photo as it is getting lost with the background mask. I also want to experiment with adding a third mask that outlines the billboard and make the fill of this mask look quite different to the fill of the eye mask.

I am also planning on experimenting with what the masks mean - I could make the fill of the billboard black and have the eye show the billboard to exaggerate that the billboard is all we see.
