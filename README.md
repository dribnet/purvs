## Crime Scene

The final submission:

The inspiration of this project is from Crime Scene. The main hue of those images is dark blue, mystery. What I try to display is making a crime scene appear in viewer's mind when they look at those photos. However, this series of work is not display how a murderer muder someone. This is more like shows the process of a detective is solving the case. Therefore, there is a lot of elements from detective films (detective's crazy wall, lots of notes). I used different ways to treat the images.  

The story of those images is a murderer that killed someone. A detective used the clue that leave in the scene and analysed the process of crime. 

The First image is a two goblet
