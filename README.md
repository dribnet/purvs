## Initial Sketch

For this project I am currently planning on working from my circle packing idea from the last project.

As you zoom in, each level reveals more circles which are making up the larger circles. A classmate pointed out that my sketch is almost trypophobia-inducing. I really like the idea of going further with this and making the final pretty repulsive to look at.
