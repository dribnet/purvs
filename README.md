## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

Basic sketch of Jules (from Pulp Fiction). His facial hair is generated relative to a few scalar parameters and a small number of manually determined points. These are the four corners of his head and the elevated sections of the handlebar. The sideburns are generated entirely from these and two length parameters.
