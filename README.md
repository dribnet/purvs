## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final Design - Hand Art

The final design for my custom pixel can be seen above.

// Pixel Description

The design uses images of gradients created by my flatmates and applies code to create a pointilism look, based on the colour of each point, a photo for each of their hands is turned into a mask. The mask controls the point size and fillet radius to turn the image into a gradient of their hand using the gradient art they created.

// Process Summary

From the start I explored different ideas, with my initial idea being that of city landscapes. However whilst working on the project I decided to change my images to that of gradients. The addition of the hand masks came when showing my flatmates my work and talking about how it could be made more interactive.

The outcome creates interesting images with the gradients and mask working together to create a unique piece for each person.

I do however feel like the outcome could be pushed a lot more with more options explored, however due to timing that isnt possible.
