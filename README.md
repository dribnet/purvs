MYSUNSET
I named my typeface "my sunset", given that the colour scheme resembles that of a sunset. The idea for the style of the typeface itself came into my head when I wondered if I could create a typeface using one one type of shape. This was also partly inspired by an exercise I did in one of my other classes in which I had to use only 4 black squares to create a given letter. 
Initially I wanted to use a few different shapes and have them transparent and overlapping each other, but this did not work out as I would've ended up going over the limit of 20 parameters. 
I drew many different versions of my first few designs on paper until I got to my final, but once I thought of the idea, I drew all the letters out and it was fairly simple to translate into code. 
I'm quite proud of how this all turned out, especially given the time constrain I was under. I also decided to round the edges of the rectangles to give the look a sort of 80's sci-fi feel to them, and to make them more visually appealing. 

In my typeface i used 16 parameters:
each rectangle had 4 parameters, and i used 4 rectangles
rect[]x - to control the x position
rect[]y - to control the y postion
rect[]w - to control the width
rect[]h - to control the height

Some letters/numbers didn't turn out as well as I would've hoped, like K and 2, but others I really like, for example: B, M, S, W, Z and 4, these all look really effective and most of them utilise all 4 rectangles.
