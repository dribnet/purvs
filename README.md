## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Font Name: Eclipsed

The inspiration behind my font is solar eclipses. I created each letter by having the main certer part of the letter remain the same, while the planet, moon, and comet move around in front of the sun, covering up certain parts to then reveal the shape of the letter. I edited the interpolation so that the planet and moon get bigger in size before shrinking, so it feels like they're orbiting around the sun. I created the sun out of a sin wave circle, which I then layered a few on top of each other slightly changing colour so that it created an ombre effect. I also created the moon and comet out of a sin wave circle, but I made those ones have 2 y values so that the curve is irregular making them look misshapen.
