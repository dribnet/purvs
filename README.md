## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

theme ideal: Ghost town
for project 3 I want to use custom pixel to  make a ghost town. Because the world
is change a lot in this half year, and it is kind of crazy. so I want to use ghost
town to express the dark side of the world. specifically, I will use grey color to
create a damaged atmosphere.
