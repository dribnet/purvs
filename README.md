## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Main Concept:

Create an alphabet inspired by the Bauhaus typography from the 1920's. This type style foucsed on geometric shapes, vibrant colours, balanced layouts with harmony and sans-serif letters in upper case. In my type I am wanting to create this style through using 3 simple shapes, a semi-circle, a line and a full circle. Each shape has a different colour similar to the Bauhaus type.


The ten parameters per letter:

- circDiam: the size of the circle
- CircleX: the x position of the circle
- CircleY: the y position of the circle 
- lineX: x position of the rectangle 
- lineY: y position of the rectangle 
- lineH: height of the rectangle 
- lineW: width of the rectangle 
- flipX: Arc x to swap numerical value with y
- flipY: Arc y to swap numerical value with x
- StrokeW: Changes the thickness of the line

Tested changing the exhibition to some words that look best in my font. For example my favourite letters are A, G, Q, R, Y and D. With the least strong letters being E, M, W and N. Good words are: GRAPHICS, YOURSELF, REPEATED, QUESTION, DURATION. I have really being struggling with getting the "S" letter to look good.

Tested changing the colour stroke and fill with the background colour as experimentation to try new ideas.
