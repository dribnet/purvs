Alphabet Colour Change - 15/05/2020

After the completion of my alphabet I noticed that my letter's didn't look good at all when it became smaller in the alphabet.html preview compared to the exhibition.html view.
So I decided to make some changes so my letters look good no matter the size. The changes I made were the colours - I went back to my initial colour scheme of black and red to
capture the vampire fang look to my font (initial idea). I couldn't decide on a white or black background for a while but in the end I picked black because it suited my theme more
and the black stroke on my triangle is a striking feature to my design so I will go with a darker BG.

I will also rework some of the letters now that I have changed the colours. The letters c, e, h, im o and 0 look very strange and while I was testing words in the exhibition, some
combinations looked very strange so I will rework these letters.
