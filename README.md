## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I took each of these photos: starting with 3 different subjects so i can get an idea of the theme/images i want to look at using for my final. The first is of a quote related to faith, the second is lavender, and then a portrait of a friend. 
Each image also has different colours, the first is quite dull, the second consists of just two colours and the third is very vibrant and colourful.

Next i will look more at a theme between pictures and experimenting with spacing and grids or perhaps removing backgroud colour.
