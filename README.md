## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I wasn't happy with how the lines in the background were looking so I decided to reuse some of my code from last years coding paper and changed some of the variables to work in with this code. I am happy with how it turned out and especially like how it looks on the first image with the water trough. However, with the blue sky, it is hard to see the details so I may try to incorporate a grey to the mask so I can add in another element. 

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
