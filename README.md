## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I managed to find a very simple fix for my interpilation problem and I felt very silly I didn't think of it before. When I dont want to use variables rather than not having them I can just make all their values zero so they appear from the sides. It's so simple I can't belive I didn't think of it sooner. The boxes are still just appearing but that should be an easy fix. I've named my font ABIKAX which is sort of a take on the word abucus combined with it's greek root abax. I came up with the idea because I think my font looks rather mathmatical and I wanted the name to start with an a so I wanted the word to start with a. That line of thought lead me to the word abacus and for some inspiration I looked up that words etymology and went from there. I also really love saying ABIKAX, it's just a fun word.
