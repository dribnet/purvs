For the distribution I wanted to get it so every face looks different enough to those around it, and feel I've achieved that. I made it so bodies with only one curve on them are rare as are bodies with 2 curves, so most of the bodies look like spongebobs actual body. I did this with the holes as well
so getting a plain spongebob is rare and will stand out.
