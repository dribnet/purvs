## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

FINAL 


For my final Images I have stepped away from my original concept of working with splatter and have looked into using my concept/ theme from the last project and adapting it to create a messy image. Since when my symbol over laps it creates new patterns each time depending on the element spacing. Each time it displayed a new pattern/background.  I have worked with this to see what best represented my images however in the end I decided to go for a tight background and made the person in my image messy kind of fading away/ dissolving. 

I wanted to make my image dynamic to kinda of represent movement - with the solid back ground and the scattered person. This also shows the contrast in my image between the 2 elements. I have used the same symbol to create the texture/pattern for my background and person however each function is being influenced differently by the spacing and placement of the object. I like how this code fits with the imagery I have chosen for this project as it fits with my theme and since I have used stars as my function/object I think having night time photographs and flash lines fits well with this as it enhances the flash but also emphasises the stars in my second image through the flash lines which adds something extra to the image. 

If I were to do this project again I think I would stick with this concept/ theme however push it more to see what else I am able to do with it. Since I changed my idea quite far into the project I think if I had more time I could experiment more with this texture and expand my images and see what I else I could do with the mask. 

Overall I am really happy with how my images turned out.
