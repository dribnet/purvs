## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today I was just experimenting with how the code works. I started with two images both took at the botanical gardens. In the first image, I made a mask that uses the squares in the areas of water. The ellipses are in the areas of rock and trees. For the second one I had the same rules applied but instead of water it's the path. I stretch out the rectangles further to make a better contrast. I'm unsure of my topic at the moment I'm just trying to experiment with the code and get my head around it.
