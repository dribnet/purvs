### Loading Time...

The idea for my clock is to have several loading bars in the style
of the Windows 95 GUI, with each loading bar representing hours,
minutes, seconds and with the date stored at the top of the window.
Two buttons at the bottom indicate whether it is am or pm. The bars
progress as time progresses. For my sketch I used PhotoShop as I
thought it would more accurately reflect the final product (compared
with a sketch on paper).
