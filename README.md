## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

idea: a space inspired design where a planet and a moon eclipse the sun, which creates the outline of the letter

possible names:
spacecase
eclipsed

I worked on my animation today - I was trying to make it look more like the planets are roating around the sun. I also made some aesthetic changes (colours, making the star be a comet instead), and neatened up my code. My next steps will be to make sure that every letter is super distinct from the other - which might mean sacraficing some aesthetic choices. I also updated my json files so they show my progression better.
