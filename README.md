### A drop clock!

This is some sketches of the initials ideas i thought of in class. The first idea is having sort of mechanism that the second drop down and follow gravity like properties. Then as the minutes and hour figures update they fall off to the side of the bar, again following gravity like properties.
the second idea is the clock in the middle which is able to be further developed away from a literal clock, then have the tidal pattern involved so that when its high tide the screen progressivelys fills with water, and lowers progressively as low tide.
