## expressionist faces - rotation experiment
using focusedRandom to apply a bit of rotation to the faces. looks a little interesting and adds a nice bit of variation to the faces. i could add it as a parameter to the faces but it seems pointless to do so? like i'd just be doing it for the sake of it? maybe i will get a better grade.
