## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

added the 3rd line to my letters and removed size as one of my parameters and replaced it with rotations. The size of my rects will stay the same so i can utilise more of my paras. my other paras will probably be colour so that the opacity can change the colours once they are overlapped.

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

initial ideas for my letters a b c playing aorund with rotate and colours
