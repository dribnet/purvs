I had to discard the Bezier Splines for now and go very simple for the sake of time. I have landed on two triangles and a line that is built out of vertices. In the future I will be exploring vertex control further as it is a topic that interests me greatly. For now I will settle on the 3 vertices that I am currently controlling. I also chose some triangles for another element that I will rotate around the screen to add to the line and create some more letter shapes.


For this iteration of the project the current parameters are:
  * `vert_1x` : Vertex 1 X position 
  * `vert_1y` : Vertex 1 Y position 
  * `vert_2x` : Vertex 2 X position 
  * `vert_2y` : Vertex 2 Y position 
  * `vert_3x` : Vertex 3 X position 
  * `vert_3y` : Vertex 3 Y position 
  * `trans_1x` : Triangle 1 X translation data 
  * `trans_1y` : Triangle 1 Y translation data 
  * `trans_2x` : Triangle 2 X translation data 
  * `trans_2y` : Triangle 2 Y translation data 
  * `rot_deg1` : Triangle 1 rotation data 
  * `rot_deg2` : Triangle 2 rotation data 
  

Oof, well this is certainly turning out to be very ugly. In the final version I shall give it a name far more fitting. For something this crude deserves a fitting name.
