## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

I played around with a new photo and I like how it turned out. I was thinking of having different flowers of similar colours for the theme so that it related. The mask i only msked hte flower and left the leaves out as i like it better this way. The way the triangles layered on top of each other with a transparency it looks interesting, I think though for the stroke I will leave it out, however I'm not sure. The stroke ives it a harshness to it however it reminds me of small shards of glass. Without the stroke it looks softer fuzzy like a sweater. The background I like the thin hair lines triangles so I will keep that, but i will play around with how i want the direction to be. I think this image works well so I will keep it this image along with the orchid. As for the last i was thinking of a different unique flower so that the theme is flowers and they all have similar colours but look interesting in their own ways.
