## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

###Concept Explanation + Proper Photo's and Masks:

Finally I have got my code to a point in which I can talk about the concepts and things, with the photos and masks now being the proper ones. 

But first some adjustments. I have found an easier way to set the background than with variables. I have instead shifted it into the setup function which only executes once. The background does still require a little adjusting, colour wise, to get it to the point I'd be happy with but otherwise I am happy with how it has turned out. Also the masked layer is currently at a purely representational stage, and is not to be taken as proper content.

In terms of concept. I wanted to do portraits, or body shots with a similar background as each other. This way I could focus on making the subject the focus. This is why I have formatted the background in the way I have.

In terms of the actual conceptual side of things, I have taken an event that I am thoroughly exposed to and an individual involved in the event. The event being Mx Capital Drag 2018, and the individual being an incredibly close friend, who won this year after many years trying. This way the project has a connection to my life.

In terms of community engagement, I would like to promote drag as an art form in the multimedia context of this project. But I would also like to highlight the individuals behind the art.

As such moving forward into the representation of the masked layer, I would like to code it in a way the leaves most of the detail in the face and leaving the outfits up to the imagination. I have this idea that if successful will work for this, but I'll go further into this in my next upload.
