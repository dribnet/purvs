Part 2: Designing the Alphabet - Finished creating characters

 I have completed creating my alphabet but I may make a few changes in the future. My alphabet is inspired by the old television static. I think it represents the inspiration pretty well. I wanted to challenge myself to stick with lines and its sharp corners, because I know some lines will need to exceed the line it overlaps - not the normal neat outlined characters. I think its exceeding lines make my alphabet more interesting, and made me think more in how I can connect the lines in different angles. As mentioned in my last update I am still unsure if this colour palette works. I have mainly focused on creating the shape of my alphabet first but with the colours in mind. Since there are more colours that I can try from the television static colours, I'll be testing them in the next updates to figure out what works best. 

 Some characters may exceed the given boundary rectangle due to my design decision, as some letters need more width distance to look the way I wanted it to. This can be seen more with the number 8 as the angle of the line affects how the other lines can seemlesly connect to it. Most of my characters have a stroke weight of 30, but I have changed the stroke weight of the characters S and Z to make the yellow line suit the design. 


The Parameters per letter:

    "lineX1": X axis for line 1
    "lineY1": Y axis for line 1
    "lineX2": X axis for line 2
    "lineY2": Y axis for line 2
    "lineX3": X axis for line 3
    "lineY3": Y axis for line 3
    "lineX4": X axis for line 4
    "lineY4": Y axis for line 4
    "lineX5": X axis for line 5
    "lineY5": Y axis for line 5
    "lineX6": X axis for line 6
    "lineY6": Y axis for line 6
    "lineX7": X axis for line 7
    "lineY7": Y axis for line 7
    "lineX8": X axis for line 8
    "lineY8": Y axis for line 8
    "sWeight1": Stroke weight for yellow line, the rest of the 3 lines have a stroke weight of 30.
