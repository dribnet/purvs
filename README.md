## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Finally figured out github issues, able to upload sketch and start on the alphabet. The plan now is to make a ring type font inspired by the Olympic logo using similar coding ideas as my last project. Want to make rings transparent so i can see overlap and create illusions of layering (similar to the breaks in rings in the olympic symbol). Using a simple colour palette to try not to over complicate the design for now. I want to modify the interpolation so that the rings move around in an orbit as opposed to a linear movement transformation.

Need to work on scaling and such as the font takes up very little vertical room which will make it hard to keep within the bounding boxes.
