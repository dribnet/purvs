## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've added more words to my code for my exhibition. They are all relevant to my style, so far there is "Fragment" which at this stage I want to keep as my final font name. "Fracture" which is my second option because I believe it best communicates my idea with the fractured pieces of stained glass triangles. "Tapering" as all of the corners become narrower and come to a point. "Serrated" as a serrated edge is normally pretty sharp and pointy which my glass triangles are. "Luminous" as the stained glass is luminous in the fact that light peers through it (hence the use of opacity). Those are all the ones I have so far, I also went through my code and tidied it up making sure I had labeled everything and made making sure that it is presentable. 

My letter parameters


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.

opacity - colour opacity

strokeWeight - weight of the shape stroke
