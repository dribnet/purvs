## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Trialled putting the model into a seperate for loop to make it grid format like my previous ideas. I think this looks super successful! Just need to fix up the other for loops so that the orange line is more smooth and then I am happy with this.

I also changed the 2nd mask for image 2 and think it looks way better now as it shows more variety in my designs and gives great contrast.
