## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

SMARTMASK EXPERIMENTATION

Here I used smartmasking methods as oposed to creating black and white vectors in photoshop. 

The results weren't as accurate but since my mosaic style grid has fairly big pixel size the imperfections aren't as visible anyway.

I struggled with using the smartmask at first but through the help of peers and tutors I figured out an issue where it couldn't identify anything with my photos. 

I've also implemented text t see how it would affect my imagery in the 3rd photo. 

I think it has more to offer in terms of audience engagement since there is a motive to the "Game?" question in the form of the basketball hoop.

TEST

Since my theme revolves around basketball I will try to incorporate ellipses that look like basketballs into my pixel. These are my initial images.

Using one of the class examples, Final Grid, I modified the sizing of the pixels to see what type of image it would produce. 

At the moment it looks better than I expected as the pixels blend well thanks to the pre-processing done on photoshop to posterise my images. As a result it output the contrast that I wanted.

I will consider adding text to evoke more thought with the audience as I believe my images don't make the impact I want it to.
