Won't be carrying on from the last project's idea.

I want to show 3D looking 2D that I couldn't do from the last project. I want to show that the door has been opened and the camera goes in to have a look, I haven't thought what could be inside the door though.

Thinking of dividing my ideas into 3,
0~5 door
6~10 something behind door
11~16 more detail/something random/unclear.
