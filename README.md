### Moon and Sun clock

It has the sun and the moon moving in a circle as the hours go by. A full circle is 24 hours. 
The background changes depending on the time of day (At midnight it's black while at dawn it's orange and at noon it's blue).

I would like the sun and the moon to be at the correct place for the time (For example the moon at the top at midnight) but I haven't done this yet.
