Binary Clock

I decided to do a total redesign from my original sketch, one that would display time in a binary representation with LED-like lights. Similar functioning hardware based clocks have been made like the one here: https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/59e0/ 

I also wanted to try the image tag from the API and see the specifics of the function and handling of image positioning.
