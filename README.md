## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Today i came up with an idea for what i want my alphabet to look like. I drew it up and added it to my file under sketch.jpg. The main idea is that it is a wheel and the letters all come from the lines. it is simple but i feel like it is actually going to be so dfficult to code. 

I need to just play around with it and try get it down to 12 parameters. Hopefully by next class i can start coding it!
