  Played around with interpolation.  Found that 50% was the best number for interpolation so far.  50% interpolation has the least amount of stuttering.  I will definitely try a different number that is lower than 50%.  I think the color palette looks good.  With the current colors I would probably change the background color.  I will definitely test a few other colors out.  I will also start gathering my exhibition words.
