## PS2 MDDN 342 2019

My character is based off a charactera friend of mien drew for me years ago. I wanted to see how I could take something close to me and explore it in new ways.

I think it has a lot of ways to control and show emotions.

so currently in the editor version it works but in the arrangement version its broken when using arcs. Because of this the tounge, nose and face cover are broken...
