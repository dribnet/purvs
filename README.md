### Clock Update
I have coded a new concept for my clock, it will be similar but not the same as one of john maedas 12 clocks where the numbers rotate around a point. I want my clock to have the seconds in the center and the hours and minutes get bigger the further out the clock goes and I want them to be further out then the seconds with the hours being on the exterior of the clock. Still need to think about the font of the letters and the colours to be used.
