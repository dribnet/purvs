Experiment: imprefections.

For this version of my font I have choosen to add little imperfections tothe letters by adding ellpises offset from the parameters, so the lines are not just straight. I decided to try this because worms are not perfectly cylinderical in real life, as seen here (https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/c/i/p/a/e/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.710x400.1cg0j5.png/1466989583378.jpg), and also it was suggested by tutors that it would make my font look more 'handmade' and natural, which is the vibe I am going for. I think that with a little bit more work this could look really good. 

The letters I chose for this veersions exhibition are DIRTWORM, OHWORM??, and DEEPDOWN. 

Parameters:
  "pointoneX" - first vertex X
  "pointoneY": - first vertex Y
  "pointtwoX": - second vertex X
  "pointtwoY": - second vertex Y
  "pointthreeX": - third vertex X
  "pointthreeY": - third vertex Y
  "letterornumber": - 0 is number and 1 is letter, a true of false type parameter.
