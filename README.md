## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
Again using another tutorial today I've been experimenting with the code. I think the effect the first photo has is really cool, it looks almost as if all the pixels are being shaken up and down, the pixels all have very iron wire, structured look to them. It's a really nice remix of the classic 'blurry' photo look. I find the little boxes being drawn around especially the windows when you zoom in are really satisfying to the eye.

My second photo is interesting as well, very magnified but I really like the fact that the pixels all look different sizes, some are really short, some look much longer.  

The third photo has a more elongated look, the other two photos definitely have that pixelated effect to them, while this one just kindof looks like the photo has been cut straight down into lines.

I will continue to iterate different versions of the first photo to see what kind of effects I can get, but the others don't really attract me enough to continue using them. But I wll keep them as ideas in case.
