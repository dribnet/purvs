Name : Invasion

Let's just forget blocks puzzle...

I have changed the name many times during the process. This is because the final outcome seems different.
Although I have a concept that what my works will look like, it still has many possibilities like if I just change the background color. For the final version, the background is red which makes more aggressive so that my project is invasion. Not only the baground is an aggressive color but also my font is quite wierd and probabaly ancient. I combined the two ellipse and two triangles to make the unusual compositions, which means people may do not see those kind of shapes in the real word. I also inspired by games, those special UI design and icons can be interesting.

I am pretty like the final version especially when I think it as the alien civilization or some ancient empire. 
Techinically, it quite easy, just two ellipse and triangles. Visually, it is really catered my taste.


$$ I didn't change the background of the interaction page cuz I want every moves of the 4 characters to be clear. 


size = ellipse size

posx = x-coordinate of the ellipse 1

posy = y-coordinate of the ellipse 1 

posx2 = x-coordinate of the ellipse 2

posy2 = y-coordinate of the ellipse 2 

t1 = x-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 1

t2 = y-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 1

t3 = x-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 1

t4 = y-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 1

t5 = x-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 1

t6 = y-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 1

r1 = x-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 2

r2 = y-coordinate of the first point of the triangle 2

r3 = x-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 2

r4 = y-coordinate of the second point of the triangle 2

r5 = x-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 2

r6 = y-coordinate of the third point of the triangle 2
