## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
For this text I thought I would try something really outside of the box and go full abstract. I thought that I would try incorporate circles into the mix again with the paint blobs and the hatching. The circles almost look randomized and are weaved into the rubiks cube. I really like the result, I feel like it could be too abstract though and could be harder to identify what the subject is. However, I really like the form and randomness of this commit. May or may not come back to this one but will continue to keep experimenting. After looking at it in a bigger size I really really like the result of the rubiks cube with this commit, the other 2 images arent as nice so may adjust the masks on those if I like this idea enough to stay with it.
