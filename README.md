New parameters that allow the two smaller squares to have different x and y lengths to each other. I have just implemented these parameters on the sketch so far as I figured out the code, but I am now goint to add it to the alphabet/letters ect and editor so that I can figure out the rest of my letters with this new parameter. I will possibly have to add up to four more parameters for some letters but hopefully not!

New parameters:

  * `sizex` : size of x axis of smaller boxes
  * `sizey` : size of y axis of smaller boxes
  * 'offsetx' : x offset determines x position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * 'offsety' : y offset determines y position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * `boxX` : x position of second small square, relative to big square
  * `boxY` : y position of second small square, relative to big square
  * 'box2Sx' : x size of the second smaller square
  * 'box2sy' : y size of the second smaller square
