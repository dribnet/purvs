## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Each of my letters is composed with 12 circles. Each of the 12 circles is shadowed by another circle of different colour.

The 24 parameters per letter:
  * circle(#)x = x position of circle. x12
  * circle(#)y = y position of circle. x12
  * squareback = fixed.

Changed font to have more eclipse points in order to make it look more similar to my inspiration of the pin board. This meant that I had to decrease the size of my fon to continue using 4x3 as the eclipses were smaller. I changed the colours to more of a fun, vibrant colour to play with the fun kids themed toy.

Number 2 and 5 need some work.
