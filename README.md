hey so i haven't really been pushing updates i've been making and went straight from a dumpy starting point to my final project so there's a lot of stuff that's been left out in between. most of it was colour changes and working out functions to get the clock and alarm working. i spent a lot of time getting the clouds in the background to work and made them move with the seconds object mainly because that's the only way i could figure out how but i think it looks good and makes the whole thing seem to move "like clockwork".

the sky changes depending on the time of day with sunset and sunrise and 7 am and pm. try to figure out how the clock works??? it is quite abstract but makes sense once you figure it out and you should be able to tell the time down to the second.

if i'd had more time i would have added weather changes and pedestrians and cars and airplanes and stuff like that, i would have also added more stuff into the background and would have liked to add a tree to the right of the building to indicate the current season.

my overall design process started with sketching out as many ideas as i could, including some very bad ones e.g. a baby playing with blocks with numbers on them, and i came pretty close to designing a dancing flower with the time on it's face and ticking petals??? i settled on the building as it was an idea quite close to home as i live in a dusty apartment building and am surrounded by views of office and other apartment buildings. i think this was the best way to represent time using a building as i incorporate as much of the space on it as i can and present a new way of reading time which i think interesting. if you are still confused as to how it works the top two rows of windows represent the hours, the middle two represent block of 5 mins each (0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, etc.), and the bottom two represent seconds in the same way. the small rectangles in the ground floor windows indicate the count of minutes/seconds in the window blocks. the alarm counts down from the top floor 7 and goes off once the elevator reaches the ground floor G. thank you.
