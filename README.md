### Super Clock Land

--------------------------------------------------

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time.

---

#### Changes:
+ Threw out the flaming digital clock concept in favour of something more ambitious
+ Make a quick test demo of a few technical features I wanted to try for this

#### Current Issues:
+ Not really a clock.
+ Framerate is EXTREMELY fragile. Will need to take care not to ruin it.

#### To Do:
+ Current vision is a floating island in a Super Game Boy style which I am rather fond of.
+ I need to nail down the shimmering water effect.

#### Notes:
+ Selective palette swapping could avoid the biggest issues with this. I should also look into taking advantage of transparency features.
+ Resolution could be lowered further if need be.
