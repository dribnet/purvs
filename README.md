## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
GRID APPLICATION TO MASKS

For this experiment, I looked at how different grid variations could be applied to my masks. I began to firstly explore differences in fill, and I immediately started seeing different results. One major concern that I originally had, was that I may need to adjust the colouring of my Kaka, so that it would stand out against my background. However, by playing with the fill function between the black and white areas of my masks, I saw that when the fill was changed to 0, instead of the pix fill, the black background already made the background surrounding the bird more darker, while still retaining detail. I did encounter several bugs when it came to plugging code into different areas of my code, which must have used up alot of memory, as my laptop would repeatedly crash, forcing me to rethink my design, so that it would be device/internet-friendly to render.

I am interested in blurring/abstracting my background, so that my Kakas can be more defined, and also to make room for me to possibly add text, which may possibly be population number comparisons from early history, compared to now, to push the informative side of my photos.
