I have finalised the form for the bread and fixed the sizing issues.

I have also added some more variables to the sliders to create more variance in the faces.

I then trained a few of the photos and saved the data. 

I would still like to add more variables to the sliders next.

I will also polish the forms and colours.

Lastly, I will import some photos of chefs as my chosen faces to add the toast face too.
