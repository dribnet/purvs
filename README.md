:memo:  
The lighter purple ellipse rotates around the centre based on the feauture of the letter. For example, A could be seen as a triangle / fan, so it has a fan shape in the middle. B has two little half circle on the side, and C is like a complete half circle.  *working on putting triangles* 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
