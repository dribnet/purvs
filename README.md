## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

As of right now I do not know what kind of image I will go for. I believe I may go for something like landscapes and city skylines or even portraits.

UPDATE #1
Currently I have a image of Scarlett Johansson that I edited years ago, an image of my MDDN241 Porject 2 model, and Vincent Van Gogh's famous starry night.

UPDATE #2
Currently I have 3 images from my year one DSDN144 photographics project 2 which looked at light. My thought process for this project was to show big name companies products in a type of evil light. I am trying to figure out how I can shape the code to best represent this idea.
