### Reimagined Concept, and Research

The files here are not fundamentally changed from my Maeda version. The only files 
that have changed are READ Me and the Images. 

So with the idea of using Braille as a visual indicator or time, I thought it important 
to point out the research I have done on this subject. Since starting this idea I have 
noticed Braille everywhere, which makes sense, because you have to make the world
accessable to blind people. But it has made me reconsider the idea of making the Braille
illegible. I want to keep the same overall concept as before, but instead I want to layer
it somewhat similar to the "Open type color font" image seen above. With the change it will
become more accessible to people, which somewhat contradicts the point, but I think it will
also be good in terms of the education of Braille numbers.

I think the image above is fairly self explanatory in terms of explaining how to indicate each
number. An important addition is the addition of the number indicator at the top otherwise 
the numbers will be confused with a letter which is not my intent. From the written examples of 
the cm values, and what I have seen in elevators, etc, I have noticed that the number indicator 
must exist for each new number. Although with them all overlapping I don't think that'll be a 
major issue I think it will be a good chance to layer them how the Hours, Minutes and Seconds 
will be layered instead to give the viewer a small understanding of what is happing with the
moving parts.
