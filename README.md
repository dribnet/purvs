## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I've started to develop my idea further and start to make the actual letters in the alphabet.js. I'm going to try to just stick to making them all actually look like letter first, and then I'm going to play around with different colours and perhaps use an arc and offset it from the shape a little bit. This extra little shape will help it to pop, and look more abstract.

So far I only have 9 parameters, and at this stage I don't think I need to add anymore. When I do the arc however, I think I might need to add some.
