Use the thumbnail picture instead of the preview picture.
Try the code. Meet a problem: Want to rotate the arc, but it is failed.
Change arc into triangle. It is easier to code it. Complete "A" sketch.





The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
