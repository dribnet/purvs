## Alphabet in Stars.

I've finished the sketch of my work. However, I feel it's still quite simple at this stage. Over the weekend I'm going to further develop my work based on my sketch. My inspiration of this project is from the star map. Therefore, the next step I'm going to make may be play aorund with the color, transparency of the color and add some astronomy elements. The problrm I met in this stage is it's hard to effectively arrange the vertexs. Therefore, I spend lots of time to place the vertex. 

In this weekend, I'm going to finished the alphabet and start to design the animation of my letters.
