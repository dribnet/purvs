## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

UPDATE #1: These are some images I took for a photography paper last year experimenting with colour, water and light. The masks follow the flow of the light and water which creates a abstract image. I would like to experiment with the mask code to get a more 3d feel.

UPDATE #2: Experimented with the masks in order to form a more defineable shape. Also played with the code to seperate what I see as the abstract form and what I see as the background. I am pretty happy with the results so far.
