## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Selection of color
I chose the "#F89880","#A7C7E7","#96DED1","#FFC0CB" and "#40E0D0" these colors to reflect the letters and numbers. The reason why I chose these colors is because they are very bright, and they give people a very refreshing feeling.


The 16 parameters per letter:
  * 'posx1':x position of rect1
  * 'posy1':y position of rect1
  * 'posw1':width of rect1
  * 'posh1':hight of rect1
  * 'posx2':x position of rect2
  * 'posy2':y position of rect2
  * 'posw2':width of rect2
  * 'posh2':hight of rect2
  * 'posx3':x position of rect3
  * 'posy3':y position of rect3
  * 'posw3':width of rect3
  * 'posh3':hight of rect
  * 'posx4':x position of rect4
  * 'posy4':y position of rect4
  * 'posw4':width of rect4
