I basically used quadrilateral shapes and rect to build up my font. I used opacity to visualize new shapes and color between quad and rect. The quadrilateral shapes I created are pretty random however the only rule in my font deisign (similarities of each alphabet) is  that there's always a vertex sticking with position 0 on X axis. The font design is pretty solid ,simple and has a little sense of ancient egyptian style.
