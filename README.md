## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme of my photo is to explore the relationship between people and their subconscious.
The first photo is a person who sees himself holding a lighter from his own eyes.
The second photo is a superposition of photos of a moving body that a person is conscious at different times. Because it is difficult for people to maintain the same posture, each different movement represents a subconscious of different moments.
The third photo is the two reactions of the same person when she see the human skeleton model.

I used three unused codes, the focused part is represented by a star pattern, the background part is represented by the pixels of the dot, and the slash is used to indicate the dynamic concept.






The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
