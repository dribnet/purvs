## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After receiving feedback, I have tried to focus on making the face and eyes of the cows more prominent rather than the stars. I decreased the size of the stars and got rid of the for loops that were drawing the ellipses on top as I found that this was not working anymore with my design. To make the eyes more prominent, I first created a second shade of grey in the mask to draw rects for the eyes as I wanted to try and have it more detailed. I then changed the colour values to be white because they were still not standing out as the original colours. 

Theme:
I have chosen farming as my theme for this project as it is something personal to me that I care about. Farming gets a lot of bad media that does not express what farming is really about. Therefore, I took into consideration the location of where the work would be displayed as most people who may view it will have a limited experience with farming. I want to express the beauty of farming and contrast the bad pictures that are presented in the media.

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
