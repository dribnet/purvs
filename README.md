## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Exhibition

My exhibition words include.

"ROBOTIC?",     
 "?MATRIX?",
 "?CODING?",
 "?SOURCE?",
 "??BOXY??",
 "PATTERN?",
 "?CIPHER?",
 "?STYLE??",
 "??RUN???",
 "?CIPHER?",

I think these words reflect the type of alphabet I have. A kind of code which has a computer look to it and on its own is a cipher because most of the letterforms they are not easily deciphered.
