## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've been experimenting with using ovals for drawing the background, and layering different valued greyscale masks on top of the parts of the image I want to draw attention to. So far I really like the effect and I'm going to continue to see what I can make with it.

[p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
