## TRAPPED

##Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

##Final

Shown above are my final images. As stated in my previous commits, my theme is based on technology. However, rather than showing how disconnected we are to the world around us, just like I initially planned to do, I actually ended up focusing more on how we are so addicted to our phones that we sometimes feel trapped in our own devices. This is the reason why all three images has the iPhone as a repeating subject, carrying out my theme throughout all three photos.

For my images, I wanted to visually represent 3 different ways on how we're so attached to our phones and are so addicted to them that it's almost like we can never let go of it. Therefore, in the first photo I made it seem as if someone is literally trapped inside the phone, shown through the hand behind the screen, and also made it seem like it is trying so hard to get out but still can't, hence why there are "cracks" on the screen. The second image on the other hand, focuses more on how, at times its like our devices are holding us back, just like handcuffs, ensuring that we never get off it. The last image, once again, represents the whole message of being trapped but the only difference is that, with having the hand holding the phone freely, this simply shows that even though we may be so addicted to our phones, at the end of the day we are the ones who are in control of this, we are the ones holding the phone.

In order to make certain elements stand out, I used a mask, with 3 different colours (black, white and grey), so that I was able to create different algorithms for each area that has been marked. The way I did this was by having 2 "passes", where the first pass draws out the 2 "if" statements regarding to the black and white colours of the masks. It does not actually draw anything for the blacks/whites as the code within the if statements are commented out, however, it does have an else statement after it, which will then refer to the other colour (grey) which isn't black or white. The 2nd pass is where the actual black and white masks draw.

The white mask, draws the original high resolution image on the part thats been selected. The black masks, draws out the grid lines, and lastly the grey, draws out the star function I created, which has an if statement where every time the random function calls the number 3, a star is drawn in different sizes to where the grey mask is.

I am pleased with my final work and feel that my theme is definitely something that could get people thinking about the amount of time they spend on their devices.
