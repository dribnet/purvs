## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have tweeked my code, mojority of the change was the rectangles. I have made it to the rectangles are random and are bigger and overlapping each other. This effect has no made it easier to see the sky colours which i wanted. I wanted to keep the circles uniform to contrast form the squares. I did make the cricles bigger as it looked funny when they were very small and spaced apart. I really like the turn out of this design. I will push the design though, to make it more different and unique.
