### Bouncing Blocks

Having changed my idea slighty so that a block falls at each time (each second/minute/hour etc) so that each block will bounce down the surface.

Randomised the bouncing speed so each block has its own path of movement

Also implmented alarm feature in which after 20 seconds after clicking a random amount of clear blocks get created and bounce down the ground.
