## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Iteration:
After my process and experimentation with masks/parameters/images I feel as I have a better understanding of how to render images that are up to my standard.

Here I have used an image underneath a part of a dock. 
Photography-wise:
 I wanted to capture the repetition of the posts, the water colour gradient with the reflections and shadows and to have the focus be the muscles growing on the support beam. I had adjusted the aperture to create a depth of field between the focal point and the other beams which I think accentuated the perlin noise algorithm applied in the render process.


Masking/Technical:
 For the first and second image I used a mask that was only applied to the focal point and it was used to retain the focus and detail in the image. I used a 0.5 - 0.9 strokeweight for the part inside the mask so it slowly rendered out to be in high detail. For the part outside the mask it was rendered at 0.1 - 0.3 strokeweight so it has more of a wispy opaque look and creates denser lines by overlapping/being in close proximity.

 In the last image I applied more of the mask to the water to create more density so the reflections were easier to distinguish.
