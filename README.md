### 01/04/22 - MORE LETTERS AND RECTANGLES

In today's class, I continued to work on my letters, creating the T and the F. I have changed my design slightly, replacing the line with a yellow rectangle. I have done this to add more room for variation as I can still make it a line if I give it a width of 0. Developing my Mondrian/De Stijl theme, I have used a chair by Gerrit Rietveld as inspiration, using the colours and black joining lines in the letters. I also removed the gaps between shapes so that all parts of the letter are connected.

I feel this extra rectangle has added to my design as now I have all of the primary colours, not just two.

I need to change the names of some of my variables if I am keeping the yellow rectangles (change from line to rect).

The 11 parameters per letter:
  * `squareX` : x offset of the red square
  * `squareY` : y offset of the red square
  * `squareSize` : the length of the sides of the red square
  * `rectX` : x offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectY` : y offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectWidth` : width of the blue rectangle
  * `rectHeight` : height of the blue rectangle
  * `lineX` : x offset of the yellow rectangle
  * `lineY` : y offset of the yellow rectangle
  * `lineLength` : the width of the yellow rectangle
  * `lineHeight` : the height of the yellow rectangle

I am still not entirely happy with my letters so I need to continue to play around with them. I know I am going to get into some trouble with some letters such as X and V due to the lack of angles, so I might have to chnage some things around.
