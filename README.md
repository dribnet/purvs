## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Project updates for Karen O'Brien

For this project I want to take inspiration from both my own and many of my family member's passion for embroidery by taking photos of places/ objects of significance to my family and making them look like pieces of embroidery or cross stitch. To do this I plan to block out each object in different colours then apply an overlay that makes the image look as if it has been embroidered.

Some examples of images I am thinking of using are of flowers from my Nanna's garden and backyard, although I'm worried that I won't be able to portray the message I'm going for so I need to make sure that all the images I use have a strong sense of nostalgia.
