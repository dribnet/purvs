## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment

FOR PURVIEW: Finalizing Changes
MAY 20th, 2020:

I've decided to put all parameters in each letter even if it only had 2 lines, but not 3. This is because I noticed that when it would transition to a letter with 1 (or 2) line strokes for eg: the letter H, to a letter with 3 strokes like F, the third stroke would just pop out of nowhere. I fixed this by just adding all 3 lines in every letter, so when it transitions to a letter with more or less line strokes than itself, it'll smoothly transition.

Having recieved feedback on the Slack design-feedback channel, I have changed the design of letter "w", as compared to the rest, it was asymmetrical. At first, I designed it in a way where it wouldn't be too similar to the letter "u". In addition, this asymmetrical design of the w made it stand out more. I just decided to make the w have 3 lines instead of 2, so it is separated from the letter u, and can also still be symmetrical.

In addition to this, a tutor pointed out to me that the colours are all too similar and need a bit of contrast. I've decided to keep the light candy pink font colour, and just contrasted that with a mint green background. This really made my letters "pop out" more.

Next, I will just update my final purview.json file, and update my final README text about my progress and state my parameters.
