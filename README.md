I figured out why a lot of the changes I was trying to make didn't work by looking through others code. I am now trying to actually form the numbers and letters into the shapes I intended. This is proving to be much more time consuming that I expected. 

I am trying to restrict myself into using 4 different forms, with two shapes being adapted. Hopefully this stage will go by a little faster.
