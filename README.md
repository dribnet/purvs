## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

my alphabets and number will consist of a static line that is at a 45 degree angle and 2 lines at right angles that will rotate and translate around the canvas to form the letters and numbers.

At the moment the amount of parameters that the letters have are:
translate1X
translate1Y
rotate1

translate2X
translate2X
rotate2

As i progress through the project i may add or remove more parameters.
