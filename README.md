Another Issue
Following on from my last discovery I have since realised that just changing it so that the smaller squares x's and y's can be different sizes in proportion to each other wasnt enough. I am also going to have to make it so that each small squares x and y can be totally different to theother small squares.
Unfortunately this will mean more parameters but I should still definitely be under 12 (unless I just jinxed it...). Thumbnails and previews show my progress through the alphabet so far that led me to this realisation. (Unable to make the G or J with being able to manipulate the x and y of each smaller square independantly.)

(have not added new parameters to solve above yet)
Parameters:

  * `sizex` : size of x axis of smaller boxes
  * `sizey` : size of y axis of smaller boxes
  * 'offsetx' : x offset determines x position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * 'offsety' : y offset determines y position of smaller squares relative to the large 
  * `boxX` : x position of second small square, relative to big square
  * `boxY` : y position of second small square, relative to big square
