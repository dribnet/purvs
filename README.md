## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Unfortunately this past week and half I have been really sick and with a 40% assignment due in the same week for another class, I have started this assignment a little later than I would have liked. 

For my design I went with a colourful and refreshing colour palette with light blues, pinks and yellows. For the design of the alphabet I decided to keep it a little simple (due to the time constraints.) I have chosen an arc to help shape the letters, these shapes are inspired by the pacman character.  

Added a rectangle shape as I felt like it adds more depth to the letters. 

The five parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `start` : start of the arc in degrees.
  * `mode` : end mode of the arc in degrees.
