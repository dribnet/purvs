The top zoom level of my design is an assortment of randomised dots. I don't want the viewer to be able to figure out what they're looking at until a little further into the zoom layers. 

At zoom level 2, the forms of the lily pads becomes discernable. 

In order to get the lily pads to look like more than just circles, I added perlin noise to the vertices of the shape. I used the code from this link as a starting point: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/112858
