## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have cleaned up my code a lot as I had been experimenting with a lot of different designs and I was not drawing the if statements in the right way. I decided to try using the grid format to draw the eyes on top of everything else to increase the effect they were having. As they were now more prominent, I decreased the pix values slightly. While the eyes look better from a distance, I still think that it adds to the design and brings in another element. 

Theme:
I have chosen farming as my theme for this project as it is something personal to me that I care about. Farming gets a lot of bad media that does not express what farming is really about. Therefore, I took into consideration the location of where the work would be displayed as most people who may view it will have a limited experience with farming. I want to express the beauty of farming and contrast the bad pictures that are presented in the media.

The images above are photos from around my farm and the area I live in algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
