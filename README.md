## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


Final:

For my 3 photos I select is sunrise mid-day and sunset, I take those photo on those day, the color change of the sky especially interesting, I use code "rotate", cause I find if I give this rotate code a big number it makes some space, it highlights my main part of the photo. I also use code "triangle", this code helps me draw a sunshine line, those nice line simulation a real sun in the bottom left side which is cool. One thing I not happy with that is I don't know how to change the position of the triangle because my 3 photo is sunrise mid-day and sunset, I try to put that at a different position, so the line can start form differents sun position.

p4:for my photo i use code "rotate" to draw some white space mke it looks more protruding. the line of the sky make it looks like a pencil drawing.

p3: in this part i change my code to draw my photo, i change cut position of the runset image, it can my mask more easy to draw and it have more space for the sky. changing the code make sure it looks good for my final.

p2:in this part i draw 3 layer for my image, i draw some picture on the mask, it looks fun, and i will change the code later , see how it work if it doesnt work well i have sraw the mask again.

p1:the 3 photo i select is sunrise mid-day and sunset, i take those photo on those day, the color change of the sky especially interesting. i begin to use my own code to draw this 3 image now.
