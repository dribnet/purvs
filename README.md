### Blocky clock

My very first idea is this digital clock forms with blocks. Just like the hourglass, the minutes display on the clock is formed by many bits of blocks. It takes 60sec for the 2 blocks at the top to reach eachother and as soon as they touch eachother than 1 block will appear at the minute display section. This works the same for the hour display.
