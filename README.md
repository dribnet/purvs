## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - 28/05/19

Experimenting and Ideation

I have updated the input images to some photos I took in/on the way to Hong Kong. I haven't made many changes to the code yet at the moment.
I'm still thinking about the theme I want to explore. Currently I'm thinking about either sustainability, or the importance of spending time with your loved ones.
As for the actual images, last class Phoebe suggested scanning drawings I've done of images and using them, which is a really cool idea that I want to try use.
