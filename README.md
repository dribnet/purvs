My idea for this is to have my existing pattern zoom out into a slightly different version of itself.

It will begin with the pattern in all pink on a white canvas. As you zoom out, it reveals that it is actually a part of the same pattern again, but in a pink/blue glitch style.

it'll have to zoom out a lot with this idea, so I'll probably begin with the pattern smaller that what is shown here in the sketch.
