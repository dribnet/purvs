FINAL :
For my final design of my letters I wanted to make my letters hard to read but visually attractive and follow a consistent theme/style. I have done this by using 12 parameters to control the size, position, rotation and colour of certain objects/elements. I have 3 key moving objects in my letters and a consistent circle as a guide for my letters/numbers that just changes colour depending if the input is a letter or an number. My 3 moving objects change rotation and position to create the letter form or number . I have made sure all objects are different and can be distinguished from one another. My idea was to try and make my letters unique and different to what you would expect. I wanted to make it a challenge to read and make people stop/ look and analyse. I drew on inspiration from graffiti and other designs that are different and out there from the usual generic lettering you would see. I wanted my letter forms to be a statement piece on its own. I ran into a few problems when creating these forms as I felt it was super hard to position my rotating forms and making them move. working with rotation was more difficult than expected because the X and Y value seemed to influence each other so that it would kind of move diagonally which meant what ever direction I wanted to move I had to figure out each X and Y and the direction to place it. I experimented with a lot of colour schemes through this design process. I decided I wanted to pick a theme that was memorable and look visually pleasing. Overall I think I have managed to do what I set out to accomplish, I like the visual aesthetic of my design and the style of my letters. If I had more time or did this project again I would probably work on my letters to resemble certain letters more so its less difficult to work out what it is saying because at the moment you have to see the whole alphabet to distinguish each letter from one another which makes it hard to read the words. I think for this project I focused more on the style and making it look different than the actual readability of the lettering.
