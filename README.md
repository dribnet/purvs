## hello

The theme of my images is Heaven. The three images represent what Heaven is to me. One feels at home, full of love, and full of hope in Heaven.

The images are arranged in a way that is designed to appear surreal, conveying the fact that Heaven is an abstract concept and beyond thorough comprehension. The first image takes street scenes and pictures of family to create a sense of familiarity and comfort. The second image is arranged with happy people hugging to convey the joy of love. The third image is more abstract as it tries to communicate a sense of hope; the handshake represents an agreement, the sign represents direction, and the other images represent a sense of calmness, freedom and peace.

I'm unsure what to do in terms of rendering at the moment, I'm trying to think of a way to keep the theme cohesive along with the way I apply my code. Just tinkering at the moment, hopefully I stumble upon something interesting.
