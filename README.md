This is the first commit towards my pattern. This was modified from flemin's original sketch 'pattern' found on OpenProcessing - https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/386139.

I found the sketch interesting with the different shapes the ellipses made as the framecount went higher, So I replaced the framecount value with another variable to experiment with the patterns that could be created. I began seeing how tiling would look and will be experimenting with colour and opacity in the upcoming future too.
