Each of my letters is made up of 2 triangles. I have resloved the issues with the triangle rotation although I have realised that the rotation moves the parameters I have controlling my x and y parameters so x and y are running on the opposite axises and/or are inversed depending on how the triangle has been rotated. This has been a minor issue I can work around by figureing out how the axis has changed and matching the offset numbers accordingly, although this does not work for letters that had rotations that arn't divisible by 90 degrees. 

I have made most of the letters in the alphabet but I am thinking I need to add in another set of parameters controlling a thicker line (up to three lines) to complete these other letters.  

The three parameters per letter:
  * `rotate' : rotation of triangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second triangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second triangle relative to the first one
