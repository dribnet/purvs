## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I don't think this looks great at all, this is just an experiment as its heading slowly in the direction I want to take my images. The important bit about this push is that its using one continous line as I have me nested forloops for the grid pattern to instead draw vertices inside a beginshape. This gives a cool effect where the only way the output is portraying the input is by changing the x position of a 'pixel' according to how much red is contained in that pixel. Leading from here I want to experiment with changing the pattern that the nested forloops follow to create a more clear and visible continous line. i also want to switch over to beziervertices as opposed to regular vertices so that the transition to each 'pixel' is smooth.
