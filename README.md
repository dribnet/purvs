The first picture was taken on Fangsipan, the tallest mountain in Vietnam. It was the first time I had a chance to be there and the scenery as well as of all the constructions they did at over 3000m above the sea level.
The second picture is Silver Fall, located in Sapa, North of Vietnam. Magnificient view of the fall, where it seems like water is pouring down from clouds above.
The last picture was taken in Angko Wat,Cambodia. I'm really facinated in acient architecture and construction.
