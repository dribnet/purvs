I went through different iterations on how i could of done the outter perimeter, and i stuck with the circular pattern instead, which worked. I used a loop and to both the small circles and the circle outlines to get the repeated pattern. Too a while for me to learn how i can set a number of them instead of it going into a infinite loop. But i was able to get some help on how i could do it which worked in the end.

The colour scheme i went for is different shades of blue because i wanted to represent a very cool like feeling with the colour use, makes it feel modern and light. I may also edit the alpha of the colours to give the saturated look which would look nice. 

My tour sections are simple yet they are subtle. I want to keep it subtle and calming because i want to replicate a very steady and relaxing look so that when people look at it they wouldnt be blasted with different motions happening infront of them.
