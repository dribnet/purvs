## Powers of 10 PRINT

UPDATE

Im slowly starting to understand how this code works and how to change it, havent quite made too many changes yet but more will come as I analyse the code further. However, i have been able to take it to a point that I like and i feels that I am managing to integrate the code and aesthetic I used for ps3.

UPDATE

I've kept working on my base level for this project and am still getting used to this code, I now have a better idea of where I want to take this project and my next step will be to start adding to my levels and adding further details.

UPDATE

I;ve started adding more details as i get more confortable with the code, the idea is finding worlds insode these bubbles, so ill be building lots of levels, thees still a lot of depth that i want to add.

UPDATE

I've been adding more and more layers as I've gone along, I'm now concentrating on the details when you are quite zoomed in and looking at adding more and more depth to the work.
