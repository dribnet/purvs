## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

Part 1:
This part was pretty easy, it was basically copying and pasting my old code into the appropriate places. I was pretty happy with the end result!

Part 2:
I wasn't very sure on how to get my sprite onto the face. I also got a little bit confused with the code, but I did my best. The arrays were kid of hard to get my head around.

Part 3:
Since I wasn't really sure how to get my sprite going using the points I don't think my sliders were very adventurous, but I did like the colour slider, which helped with the next part. I couldn't really think if what to do with the leaves, but know that I think about it I feel like they would've been a good slider in getting the position of the face in a better position if I played around with them a bt more.'

It was interesting finding some photos though! I think the children really fit quite well with the playfulness aspect.

Part 4+5:
Since I wasn't very happy with how my sprite didn't really take on the features of the face below it, I changed some of it's features here to better match. It made them more recognisable also, which helped me get away from all the sprites blending together.

Picking out which sprite fit with which face proved challenging, but the colours helped a bit.

Overall, I think the sprites turned out looking more like fantasy masks, but it's also a visually pleasing effect and still fits in the theme of playfulness I was going for. Sometimes they look a little ridiculous, which makes me happy, and that's all I really want people to feel when they look at my project.
