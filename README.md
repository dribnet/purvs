My initial idea was to use slice circle (like a burger) to design my font. But when I try to do it, I find I can not use p5. Js to achieve my idea, so I change my design.
In this sketch, I use a radius 40px circle for my background and I draw some rectangle on it, it can make it looks like cut the circle as a slice. I can change the position and the size of my rectangle to draw the font.
coding: posx, posy,pos2x,pos2y control the position of the shapes.
color use: bright background and dark letters
