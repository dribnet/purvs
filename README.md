### The concept of clock

I still have the problem for updating the work from my own computer so that I can't update my work in weekend. I just chose one of the samples from Maeda's clocks. I was thinking about the connection between the number and the shape. Also I was inspired by my original idea about the clock, the black and white means the night and daytime. I create the clock to show a balance behind the time.

I just want to show my concept of my clock. I was inspired by the traditional philosophy. That means the time is equitable for anyone so that it keeps the balance in the world. I just want to give the sense of contrast to show the balance.

The further idea aiming at putting all the elements together to create the cohesive aesthetic style. when the inside circle rotate, it pour the white or black into the outside circle.
That's just a rough idea.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your

[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
