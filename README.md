## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Update 3: I finally have a full alphabet, I still haven't got the editor working but in the meantime, I am playing around with the size and y positioning within the editor. This will help to work with my idea of using my hand writing

Update 2: I have decided as part of a design feature to incorporate my own handwritting into this problem set. I am dyslexic and as part of this, letter sizing and spacing and readability is never the same to each letter. I thought it would be cool to play on the idea of this just to give my design a little bit of an edge. 

Today, I am concerned that my design looks too simliar too others. I think I will start to play around with making the letters more abstract, I think it will help with making my design different and not always having to have things visual in order but my code is in order. I also couldn't manage to get my editor working but I have asked for help in 'hail a tutor' as I believe the sliders will help me a lot
