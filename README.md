## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

###Development Mask Layer Completed:

So I did my masked layer seperately to my background layer to make things as clear as possible for my eyes while editing. This iteration took a long time to narrow down to a good form, and I had a few issues which I will address while talking about the concept.

So the conceptual design for the mask was to have the face as clear as possible and the as you go further down the body it gets less clear. This was suppose to highlight the performer behind the art. It has been relatively well done to how I would like it, however I couldn't get the math behind it to cooperate in such a way that the bottom would be even more unclear. So sadly it wasn't a total success. Also orignially the head was 400% clearer frokm the top and the body was the same. However I did the math and that would leave the computers needing to render for 4 hours and at this point that is not possible, so I had to comprimise the value a little bit. 

I ran into a lot of issues along the way with the math and my brain not being quite ablke to understand so the math in the code works but I won't be able to explain it well. But I think I am ready to combine the two layers and hand in.
