## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my first experimentation with the image i took this morning.

The image of the logo and picture on the wellington recycling rubbish trucks.

There is a mask on the image creating rectangular pixels.

I will play around with different shapes and colours to see what depicts best in the image.
