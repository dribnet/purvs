I basically used quadrilateral shapes (by vertex) and rect to build up my font. Opacity in my font is used to visualize new shapes and color between quad and rect. The quadrilateral shapes I created are pretty random however the only rule in my deisign (similarities of each alphabet) is  that there's always a vertex sticking with position 0 on X axis. The font design is pretty solid ,simple and has a little sense of ancient egyptian style.
