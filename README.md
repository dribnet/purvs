## PS2 MDDN 242 2018
For the interaction I test all my letters and they all worked and there are some changes that I did not even imanige of myself.
The rx1,ry1,rx2,ry2 control the red line.
the ox1,oy1,ox2,oy2 control the orange line.
The ex,ey ex2,and ey2 control two yellow circles.


<<<<<<< HEAD
My idea is com from the pizza, so I choose red line, orange line and two yellow circles, they are ham, cheese and squid or onion roll to constitute my letters.
=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].
>>>>>>> upstream/part2

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
