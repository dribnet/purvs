Each of my letters is composed of 4 symmetrical quadrangles. And there are 3 parameters to control each of them. So there are 12 parameters in my every letter.
The 12 parameters per letter:

  * `size1` : the size of the red quadrangles
  * `posX1` : the X position of the red quadrangle
  * `posY1` : the Y position of the red quadrangle

  * `size2` : the size of the blue quadrangles
  * `posX2` : the X position of the blue quadrangle
  * `posY2` : the Y position of the blue quadrangle

  * `size3` : the size of the 1st quadrangle with edges
  * `posX3` : the X position of the 1st quadrangle with edges
  * `posY3` : the Y position of the 1st quadrangle with edges

  * `size4` : the size of the 2nd quadrangle with edges
  * `posX4` : the X position of the 2nd quadrangle with edges
  * `posY4` : the Y position of the 2nd quadrangle with edges
