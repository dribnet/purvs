## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel



I decided to add a grey mask as I wasn't happy with the look of the water on the third image. I will also be adding a grey mask to the other images, to areas such as water. The grey mask is linked to DrawLine which draws horizontal lines. I like how the water looks like it is flowing between the trees. It makes the white part of the water look glossy and reflective which I will try to replicate on the other 2 images. I think this was the effect I needed to finalise my assignment. I will add a grey mask to the other 2 images and polish the outputs.
