im surprised i like this one as much as i do!! it actually looks quite nice!! and the colours remind me of one of my favourite music artists too. yeah i like this one a lot, especially the letters that have all 4 rectangles!! 
however i think i am going to change it again as the 2nd colour is a bit hard to see. and i also have another idea.
