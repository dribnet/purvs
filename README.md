## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

  4/05/2020 First sketch 
Each of my letters will be composed with one circle and one arc. The size and x position of the first circle is fixed, but the positon and size of the arc changes with each letter and is controlled by the parameters. I have started with very simpistic forms but I quite like how the curves give the letters a soft and playful design.

The eleven parameters per letter:
  * `ellipseY` : y position of the main circle
  * `width` : size of the arc
  * `height` : size of the arc
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the arc in relation to the circle 
  * `offsety` : y offset of the arc in relation to the circle
  * `angleStart` : angle to start the arc
  * `angleStop` : angle to finish the arc
  * `rectX` : x positon of the rect
  * `rectY` : y positon of the rect
  * `rectW` : width of the rect
  * `rectH` : height positon of the rect


6/05/2020 Alphabet beginning 
	I have started putting my letters into draw_letters.js and letters_js and gettign the right proportions to fit the guiding box. I have draw out the alphabet on paper using the circle and arc and have ideas for each letter. I have added a stroke to the circle as I found my design was looking too simplistic but I may develop the design more when I move further into the project. I have also added another parameter to change the y positon of the circle as I discovered that the cicle needed to be higher up to form letters such as p, g, j, q, and y. 

6/05/2020 Editor and developed design
	I have set up the editor and changed the parameter names ready to be used. After thinking about my design further I decided to sketch out a new idea that was the same as my first idea but included a rectangle. I found that this allowed me to form the shapes easier and added another element to the design that made the letters more readible and have a cleaner look. I also relaised that without the added rect I would not be able to draw the numbers very easy at all and did not like how they looked when I tried to sketch them. To incorporate this change I have added 4 new parameters for the x and y position and the width and height of the rect, bringing my total to eleven. I am really happy with how this turned out and I also changed the background colour slightly to look better with the green of the rect.

9/05/2020 - Finished drawing alphabet 
  I have finished drawing my alphabet but I will continue to refine it. I found that some letters were quite hard to do and don't look as good as other letters. For example, the j and f
