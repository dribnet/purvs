## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For now I just have three images of my dog to have a play with this code.
I was going to use images of stained glass window from different Church
to be my ps4 topic image since the glass shards look kinda similar to 
my heart glyph from ps3. But I will need to think about how to link 
the images to the community and sustainability also.
