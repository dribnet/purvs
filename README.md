## PS1 MDDN 342 2017


Hannah Dockerty PS2, Face Mapping

In starting this project, I wanted to continue to explore the portrayal of emotion within a stylised human face. This proved more of a challenge than in PS1, as in real life (and particularly in photographs), people are much less expressive than the stylised faces I had been creating. 

Due to this stumbling block, I chose to use images predominantly of children in my final design, as they tend to be much more expressive than adults, and don't put on the emotionless 'happy' mask that adults tend to don in front of a camera. 

Though I had originally planned to have a more subtle blending between the photo and my generated face, I decided to emphasize this idea of a mask. I did this by toning down the bacground image with a grayscale filter, and also adding outlines around the face and several key features.

I continued down the vein of detailed eyes from PS1, however decided to include other facial features as well (in order to help compensate for the lack of expression in the source images). I kept these fairly simplistic in order to keep the attention on the eyes, as well as to play into the idea of the mask I mentioned earlier. 

In order to create enough variance within the population, I created different color arrays for the eyes and skin, and trained the program to recognize when to use each color value. 

I also added values for the eye positions, profile, and size, in order that the face could be mapped onto images in front, half or side profile. This was only partially successful, as it was difficult to train the program to recognise these values with such a small population size. This is something I would like to continue to build upon going forward.
