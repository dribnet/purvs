### My Maeda Clock

The is the clock design I made which is a variation of John Maeda's 
3rd Clock. Obviously its just a drawn still as asked for. However I 
adapted my concept to fit inside the frame work of his design. The 
Braille (Which I mispelled in my last blog post... Oops) has been 
stretched and scaled around one point like in Maeda's with the bottom 
of the braile heading towards the centre of the spiral. Also my first 
when I realised how all this stuff is working =D
