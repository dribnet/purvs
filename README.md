I want to create a geometric shape animation which will change change in hue color. I want it to loop in different variants of colours but chances are I may just loop around one colour and change its saturation instead. Depending on how i can do the code, I will probably have to test around different shapes and variables.

I was able to find a geometric shape I really like in Pinterest and I managed to implement it in code but with some slight restrictions but overall almost the same shape.

I was able to make the animation of the two circles to work the way I want them to do. I added extra circles on the other outter circle to go around it, they come down near the middle then bounces back and continues to repeat. At this point I need to include some sort of colour changer in the shapes, changing the hue if the diamond and circle. I managed to learn on what to use which is Lerp. I need to look into lerp and see if I can manage to create the colour hue changer in the animation.

I'm still playing around with some of the shapes, I'm trying to get rid of negative space as much as i can to fill in everything inside the canvas. I still want to develop the colour changing a bit more to make it more satisfying to look at, maybe make it a bit slower than how it is at the moment. But overall it still fits my whole intention and aesthetic im looking for which im very proud of. I believe that i can further develop this concept before hand in to get a good colour changing pattern.

Final changes, i really liked the final outcome of my code. The main aesthetic i was aiming for was a soft colour pallet with using geometric shapes as the main representation. I initially wanted to have an image in the background but i think that having to make a server to make it work is a bit too much. But if i ever looked into developing it more i would try to add in some. My main intention was to create a less busy field and small animation without any big changes to the full field. Which i believe i manage to do, so overall project was a success.

Final thoughts on my design and intentions. I really like what i did for this project, i believe that i achieved the intetions i want to put into my work, i wanted create a design which didnt fully show a busy scene and more focusing on rthe aesthetic. I wanted to get rid of negative space which i filled most of the empy space around the scene with circles that connect to each other, the color pallet i chose is a very soft and desaturated color, i wanted to amke it easier for a person to look at for a long time since it's a wallpaper and i made it so that the colour changes in hues. 

I think if i made more complex shapes and movements with how it looks at the moment it would be more interesting to look at. Instead of changing from one colour maybe multiple colours, i also think that addng a background image fits with the aesthetic. But i was unable to add in a background image because for some reason it would crash as it reaches near the end of the gif creation so i stopped it and chagned ti to a colour background instead.

But overall i believe i achieved what i wanted to create and i'm happy with the outcome.
