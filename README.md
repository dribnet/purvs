PROTOCOS STYLISED
Welcome to the stylised version of my Protocos font. Here I have flipped the colour scheme completely, and using more custom shape functions in draw_letters.js I have added a line offset to the first two coordinates of the first triangle for added flare and a drop shadow for added pop and dynamism.
This version of my font exists to provide a palette cleanser from the usual red and black colour palette in all of my other versions of Protocos, and strays away slightly from that original anchor point Adobe Illustrator idea.
I hope you enjoy. Christopher.
