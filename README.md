## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I'm figuring out they layering technique I want, and it's coming together quite nicely. I have a blurry background created by using pointSize as one of the inputs for the ellipse sizes, and defining the other with a solid number. I really like the background effect it creates. Now I'm just working on getting the other layers looking how I want them to appear.
