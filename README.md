## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

This is my second concept of letter A, B, C, and I found that my previous idea do not fit the principle of the project brief. Because of the limitation for 12 parameters, I have to give up for initial version of letter A, B, C. If I still use the first version, the parameter might be more than 12. 

Therefore, I make the backup and it is also final version. The letters includes three ellipses, two lines and a diamond-shape or a quad(formed by vertex()). And my idea is trying to abstract each letter, and different patterns represents different letters.
