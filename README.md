### Updated clock with ellipses and current time


I have finished my clock and abstracted my original sketch idea and influenced it with the grandfather clock. The day and night cycles are mapped to hours which change colours depending on what time it is. The hours/mins/secs/mils are also mapped to the size of the screen and the alarm function flashes when active.
