### Super Clock Land

---

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time. Adhering roughly to the capabilities of the Super Game Boy, an add-on peripheral for the Super Nintendo.

---

#### Changes:
+ Palette swapping mostly implemented, does not yet respect tile palettes
+ Crude alarm function added

#### Current Issues:
+ Not really a clock yet
+ Framerate is awful and I have no idea why, the only difference is where the value is accessed from!

#### To Do:
+ Figure out what horrible curse has ruined my framerate
+ Start actually implementing the scene
+ Nail down the colours + implement palette tiles

#### Notes:
+ Ocean currently does not use palette swapping scheme, though *technically* is still within the limitations of the SGB
