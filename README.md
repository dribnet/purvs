## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

New images, code changes, and planning.

Replaced images and masks 1 and 2. These aren't final (it was too sunny today), but they're more like what I'm gonna work with. I want to make a series of images based around personal cosiness. All images will have two areas, divided by a window or something similar. "Inside" will look very soft, and almost painterly, while the "outside" will look like rain. For me, a progression of cosy places basically leads towards my computer, so I think I might want the last one of be a screenshot from a game I enjoy, following the same conventions as the other two. The only real problem with that would be that my go-to cosy game would be Skyrim, which on my PC is currently uninstalled, and reinstalling it would drag me down that modding rabbit hole - especially if I wanted a window you could see through in it.
