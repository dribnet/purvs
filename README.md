I finished boxing out my alphabet and my numbers. I have stuck to just using the two triangles and found that making my alphabet both legible and nice to look at was easier as opposed to my numbers which i found harder to create using just the two triangles thus they are harder to define. I may look at refining these numbers more and try get each to resemble their assigned number more. 

Overall i am happy with my progress and how my alphabet is turning out. I also changed the colours to blue and red which i think complement each other more than the previous orange and purple i had that was too overpowering reminding me more of a roadcone. I will now look at making these small changes as well as thinking of a name for my font + exhibition words.

The parameters per letter are now:
  let pos1x = posx + letterData["x"];
  let pos1y = posy + letterData["y"];
  let pos2x = posx + letterData["2x"];
  let pos2y = posy + letterData["2y"];
  let pos3x = posx + letterData["3x"];
  let pos3y = posy + letterData["3y"];
    
  let pos4x = posx + letterData["4x"];
  let pos4y = posy + letterData["4y"];
  let pos5x = posx + letterData["5x"];
  let pos5y = posy + letterData["5y"];
  let pos6x = posx + letterData["6x"];
  let pos6y = posy + letterData["6y"];
<!--   * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one -->
