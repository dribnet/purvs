"W" Key now switches to wall paper
"L" key now switches to landscape

I have made a new wall paper and moved my old one to the land scape area I still have no idea what to do for my land scape one so i will have to look in to that a bit more i have a general idea but i have no idea on how to execute it code wise so stuck at the drawing board for a bit.
