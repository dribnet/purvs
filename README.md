## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Alphabet

Each of the letters drawn are made up of 9 hexagons which have 18 parameters each.
The letters which appear to have less than 9 hexagons do indeed have 9 hexagons, the extra hexagons are just being drawn on top of existing ones.
All the letters are a mix of upper and lower case, I thought this looked more interesting and "kiddy".
Some letters are also drawn higher than the line. This is just to keep all the letters consistently aligned to a 'hexagonal grid', it also makes some letters look like they're bobbing up and down when drawn in a word.

The eighteen parameters per letter:

 * `hex1_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex1_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex2_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex2_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex3_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex3_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex4_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex4_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex5_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex5_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex6_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex6_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex7_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex7_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex8_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex8_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex9_xPos` : x position of hexagon# on the canvas
 * `hex9_yPos` : y position of hexagon# on the canvas
