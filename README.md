This README explains the experimental grid of faces

This is an experiment to see what a grid of my pattern faces look like all together. I really love them, I think the combination of softer colours, with the occasional pop of bright pink really works. However I was right, it takes more than half a minute to load, and when it does the randomise and scale buttons won't always show up. I have added a large comment to my code that says CHANGE SLIDER VALUE HERE, so that the starting zoom value can easily be changed within the code. It is a nice experiment, but not sustainable loading times for a whole project. In future my masking will have to be kept to one lot, two at the most, and preferably not reloaded every time.
