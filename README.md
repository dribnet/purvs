## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I have chosen for my images is graffiti in the Wellington region. These specific images were taken in the abandoned military bunkers surrounding the city (specifically the Brooklyn windmill bunkers and Fort Ballance on Scorching Bay), where every surface is covered in colourful tags. The council doesn't bother to remove these works, so they layer up ontop of each other to create a chaotic yet beautiful pattern and texture. To me, this represents freedom of expression and art. This graffiti is not on any privately owned property, nor is it in the way of the general public. This is a form of art which is generally not acceptable to the civil eye, as it is disruptive and chaotic.

In my rendition of these pieces, I want to show off the chaos and energy these places possess. I want to celebrate the artwork done by these artists, rather than hide it.

This version follows the grid/pixelation idea, but the mask changes the colour of the pixels by manipulating their values. I also used a random variable to add random white dots over only the masked areas. This used a lot of if statements but I think it creates quite a cool effect. Now that know what I can do I will make my effects work together to create a cohesive image.
