FINAL FONT:

 In the project two, I use two sectors as module to build the letters and digits.One sector has stroke and anther doesn't. I think it is better for alphbets to transformation.Because the sectors can be changeful from o degree to 360 degree while the strokes can highlilght the significant part. For the color paletters,I use red,yellow,green to compose the alphabets so that they looks like red heart watermelon and yellow heart watermelon.The name of the fonts is "MELONLTR". I make effort to keep the fonts  express clearly and easy to recognize. After modifying and adjusting , here is my final font.



In the 	draw_letters.js	file and exhibition.js file, I replace the SwapWords variable into : MELONLTR","CHERYNYN","12042019","JIANGXIN"

The ten parameters per letter:
 size1 : radius of the first sector
 size : radius of the second sector
 offsetx1 : x offset of the first sector 
 offsety2 : y offset of the first sector 
 offsetx : x offset of the second sector 
 offsety : y offset of the second sector 
 aecS : start of the first sector
 aecE : end of the first sector
 aecS2 : start of the second sector
 aecE2 : end of the second sector
