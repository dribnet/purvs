## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Fri 1st June
I experimented with the smartmask but because my theme doesnt focus on people/animals and focuses more on the enviroment it didnt highlight
what I wanted. For my images I wanted to the cultural enviroment to be masked differently to the natural enviroment to show contrast
between the 2. For example my middle picture is masked in a certain way that the natural tree leaves are random squares and the cultural
are in ordered squares as if to show that humans have affected and almost 'ordered' this area for a pathway. With the lightpost and
bench masked with a 3D hex shape to connect the top 'natural enviroment' to the bottom 'cultural enviroment.'

I have worked out how to create two masks and implement them into my artwork piece. I have also taken polygon code from 
https://p5js.org/es/examples/form-regular-polygon.html to create an almost 3D affect of the bushes in the first picture.
I am now going to keep experimenting with the code I have created and try to produce something creative from my next few pictures.
I am also going to create secondary masks for my other pictures.

For my theme I am leaning on the idea of the cultural enviroment taking over the natural enviroment. Merely touching on the idea of pollution and how we are destroying our earth.

Tue 22nd May and Previous
I have imported my own images and used the sample code given in class and changed it. So far I have done all 3 of my images with masks and replaced the old cartoon ones I was experimenting with earlier. I am now going to experiment with the code to create abstract images of my 3 imported images to get more ideas.
