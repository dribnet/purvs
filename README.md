### Maeda Clock

As of now I changed my clock to be simpler, so instead of individual squares I changed it to be long rectangles that represent the idea of the block like snakes. But changing this I ended up starting again because it is easier than just rewriting the bits. 

I had some trouble with drawing the rectangles in so I just used functions and if statements to make it less confusing. Once I had everything drawn, I ran into the problem of that the numbers wouldn’t change every minute instead it changed every second. It turned out it was just really simple and I completely over thought it way too much. I had seconds instead of minutes. 

Now most things work I can’t seem to get the time to loop back. So once it is at 23:59 it should go to 00:00 and start again but it just stops. I feel like it is a really simple solution but I cannot seem it figure it out. However with the alarm, I have a snake move across the screen and it loops until the alarm stops. I’m not sure about the alarm yet. I’m thinking of having the one main snake perhaps with a message on the back or a bunch of other snakes come from different directions and slither all over the screen. I’m not too sure about it, but this is what I have so far.
