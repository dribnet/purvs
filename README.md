~Monster Drawer~

This program draws cartoon monster faces on top of photos of faces.
It uses the values from a face-tracker to accurately paste the features correctly into the positions.

This version uses a different method to draw the face than i had been using previously, which tracks the
face points much more accurately. There are also added sliders for eye number, color scheme,
nose type, mouth type, and horn type. For future versions I will think more about how to accurately
represent the facial features of the photos, as currently it would be hard to choose the features based
on the photos as they're too abstract.
