## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

I asked about how to make the triangles slightly transparent and it seemed to work with some help from the lecturer. I played around with the opacity and it worked well I think. You can see the mixture of different shades and they blend well together which I like. I think the flowers could be closer together in terms of the layers of triangles but i like the effect of the choppy layers. As for the background i think it would be nice to see some more experiementation as currently it is a bit plain. I like hte hair effect but you cannot see the background colours well as it just looks black and white. I like how you can actually see what the image is this time, I want to test out some other images and see how it will work.
