## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Today and yesterday I was experimenting witrh swapping the main sphere with a square, however this didnt look right so i made a design choice to stick with the sphere. I also sompleted the letters M through to W. Some of the letters need improvement as they dont look right.



The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  'start' : First angle for my arc
  'stop' : Second angle for my arc
