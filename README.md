## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

This is my final version of my font, i decided on the name ORBITAL? as my design was based of orbits and planets 
i used a variation of filled and stroked ellipses to impliment this into my design.

At the start of the project i decided i wanted to do something with circles. I thought of doing
4 points with lines connecting them all but i saw someone had already thought of that and decided to go 
for something a little more original. So i started using filled circles as planets and stroked ones for 
orbits.

To create my alphabet using these 4 ellipses, i tried to make the planets block out the orbits to create some 
of the main lines of the letter. For example the R has the big filled circle blocking the left side of the oribit
to give the top and the small one blocking the bottom.

My animation is pretty basic they just sort of move into position. I originally wanted to do a bouncing ball type of animation but
it seemed a bit too complicated.

The eight parameters per letter are:
  * x and y for the small filled cicle
  * x and y for the large filled cicle
  * x and y for the small stroked cicle
  * x and y for the large stroked cicle
