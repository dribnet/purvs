This is just an idea of what I want to do, not coded. I simply wanted to get my ideas on paper, if this idea does work then it will be very usful to have this sketch as it will help me work out the placement of my letters. I want to create maze type of font. I intend to have a grid that is where my maze lettering will take place. I will have to work out the logistics of this, but am looking at the coding train maze building video to help work out how I could accomplish this. These colours are not neccesarily the ones that will be present in my final.
