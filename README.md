Each of my three letters here are made up of two lines. The center point of each letter is the only one with a defined variable, it always sits in the middle vertically. 

The two other points both have x and y coordinates with the center one only having an x offset variable. I tried to look at how i could simplify the letters into as few lines as possible. However im not certain this concept will be practical for an entire alphabet as 5 variables may be too much.

The five parameters per letter:
  * `x1` : The x coordinate of the first lines starting point
  * `y1` : The y coordinate of the first lines starting point
  * `x2` : The x coordinate of the second lines ending point
  * `y2` : The y coordinate of the second lines ending point
  * `offset` : The x coordinate of the center point where the two lines meet
