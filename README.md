## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

//For my sketch i have chaged the shape of the letters to rectangle, and also changed the color to red.

//in this update i have changed the design of my letters and also started to add more parameters, for now i got eleven parmeters, it is little bit too much, i might going to change it again in the future.

//cpmpleted the sletch of my new design, i think i will be focus work on this one.

//coped the codes to the draw_letter.js, and fixed some the bug that shiftted the box.

//finished most of the letters, the missing ones still need some "redesign" work, i will start work on them while i put the numbers in.

//completed all of the letters, i will start work on the numbers later

//finished the numbers, thinking about upload the progress i have got so far.(unable to upload files, unknow error.)

//added the interaction to the letters.

//fixed the error on number "5".

//finished some polish, if nothing is wrong then this will be the one for final.

//i have find that if i change the strokeWeight from 3 to 2, the pattern of overlapping area will be more fit to the design that i have struchured at begginning, the reason i didn't put 2 there is i have did some comparison and find out that set the strokweight to 3 can make the letters in alphabet page more clear, but at the other pages it will change the size a little bit. at the end i think it is more important for me to present my design clearer, so i changed it to 2, and also made some adjustment on some of the letters.

//this is the final.

//sorry final change, deleted unnecessary swapwords.

The eleven parameters per letter:
  * `size` : size of rectegle
  * "rx1": x offset of the no.1 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry1": y offset of the no.1 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx2": x offset of the no.2 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry2": y offset of the no.2 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx3": x offset of the no.3 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry3": y offset of the no.3 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx4": x offset of the no.4 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry4": y offset of the no.4 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "rx5": x offset of the no.5 rectegle relative to the first one
  * "ry5": y offset of the no.5 rectegle relative to the first one
