## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Experimenting back with a standard pixel so that I can keep the colour accuracy, this time im using the same parallax system i used in the last commit, except this time with lines and a small ellipse at the end.I really like this one, think im leaning towards it so i might spend some time developing this idea. I think what I want to try next is instead of just drawing a vertice from the position of the pixel to its parallaxed position, Ill instead use a for loop and redraw a series of small ellipses in its place. The idea with this system is I can then change how each pixel scales as the parallax is increased, an example of this would be having the opacity decrease/increase, i think this way I could get away with using greater parallax, and then making it trail off into the background. I am noticing a continued error with my commits which is the white bordering pixels around the left and top side, I think this is an issue with the grid system draws the pixels but Im not sure.
