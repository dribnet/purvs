## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Update 4: I am now playing around with the opacity, I think I want to use the parameters to create the triangle shapes better, I will just need to make sure that I don't go over the 20 allowance. I think with opacity I could create an if statment out of this which could add some interest to the design. I am a little bit more conifedent with what I can use and have a better direction on how I want to create my design. I defenity want to keep it abstract and prehaps even have little to no link to what the letters are kinda like bralie but it is an organised pattern.

Update 3: Success! I was using StrokeW instead of Stroke2W in my code so it was double defined. I will now work this around for my other parts of the code.

Update 2: I have uploaded this git commit to get some help with stroke Weight varaibles

Today, I have played around more with my design, I really want to challenge myself using code variables that I don't normally use, I've started off with arch and triangle as I don't have a clear direction on what I want to do with my design, I think I want to play around with morse code or braile and the idea that variations of patterns create different letters

The parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `archH` : h offset of the arch height
  *	`archW` : w offset of the arch width
  *	`StrokeW` : Weight of the stroke
  *	`opacity` : Colour opacity
