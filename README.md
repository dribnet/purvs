Style 2:

I decided to go with another abstract shape design, but incorporating the arrow will add a bit of flexibilty to my designs. Each of my letters is composed with two circles and an arrow shape. There are 3 parameters controlling each of the two circles and 3 parameters controlling the arrow. I'm not sure if having the arrow rotate and stretch will prevent a cohesive look so I will have to look at how I can keep a certain structure to my charcters if I continue to develop this idea.

The 9 parameters per letter:

arrow Tilt: angle in degrees to tilt the arrow shape
arrow X: Stretches the arrow on the x axis (before tilt applied)
arrow Y: Stretches the arrow shape on the y axis (before tilt applied0
ball 1/2 visibility: whether or not the circle is visible
ball 1/2 position Y location of circle on y axis in relation to middle of screen
ball 1/2 position X: location of circle on x axis in relation to middle of screen
