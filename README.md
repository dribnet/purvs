## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

21/4, I've decided to make my alphabet from triangles, at different angles, sizes and positions. 

The paramaters I have so far are:
1 Size
2 offsetx
3 offsety
4 triAng
5 tristart

Once my project is done I hope to have maybe twice the amount of paramaters as my project is very limited so far.
