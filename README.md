## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Update on my progress! I have now completed all my number and letters, I feel like I have solidified my idea of creating the stained glass look. I wanted to fiddle around with my letters abit more and make sure that they are readible. I've been having problems with the letters though, I've deliberatley removed the opacity on them so that you can identify the letters against the numbers. Overall I like the cohesive look but I want to experiment alot more (Epecially with the numbers).  

My letter parameters


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.
