## Smartmask

This is my experiment with the smartmask software. It's a simple image interpretation just using the base circle and square shapes to denote the difference between white and black parts of the mask. The smartmask software doesn't really work for my project (as it foucses on the specific parts of flowers), which is unfortunate as it's a much faster way to go about creating the masks.
