Basic sketch of Jules (from Pulp Fiction) and Prince. The faces have no features other than its shape and hair. I think this is an interesting (perhaps contrived) style; currently the sketch attempts to illicit facial recognition with the minimal detail possible. An interesting test of this will be to differentiate similar faces.

Their facial hair is generated relative to a few scalar parameters and a small number of manually determined points. 

The only hard-coded points on Jules are seven corners of the face, the position of the hair, and the elevated sections of the moustache.

Prince's moustache is much more highly parametised than Jules'. It is based entirely off the rest of the face, with six additional scalar parameters (although two of them more or less make up a 2d vector).
