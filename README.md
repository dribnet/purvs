Started from where the last project left off, I have an idea for the procedural map. When you zoom in on a line, you see a similar arrangement where the background is the now out of scale line you zoomed in on. In my example, I zoomed in on a pink region to find a new design with a pink background and the pink lines have been replaced by white. The reveal, other than finding a smaller design, would be the change in colour

I've imported the map code and I've figured out a simple way to deal with the co-ordinate system.

I still had some bugs I wasn't aware of with the map code, which I /think/ I've fixed now.

A) I have an idea for how to alter my design from the last project. I think I might make it so you never see the end of a line, they are of infinite length. I think that would be the best way to adapt to the infinite plane.

B) I now have a grid on the infinite plane, starting work on adapting the last project's design
