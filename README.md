## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Today I didn't change anything related to my sketch or idea, however I did copy my code over from sketch.js to draw_letters.js so that they would display in the alphabet section. To make this work I had to rewrite some small parts of the code to get them all sorted for the new draw_letters file, but now that I've done that I can work from this file for most of the rest of the project.

I also got the editor set up and working. It seems like a really useful and powerful tool and I will be sure to make the most of it.

I am pretty much at the stage where I can knuckle down and get to work on finishing all my letters. Before this, I want to make sure my idea is set in stone. I do like the idea of using only two rectangles, as I think it will be an interesting challenge, however I am slightly worried it will be too simple in terms of the look. Maybe I could add one more element in to spice things up? Something for me to think about over the next few days.  

The parameters per letter:
  * `size` : size of the second rectangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `corner1` : how curved is the first corner
  * `corner2` : how curved is the second corner
  * `corner3` : how curved is the third corner
  * `corner4` : how curved is the fourth corner
