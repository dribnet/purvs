This is just a quick experiment done in class to get my head around the ideas presented in class and hat is going on with the code.

This example is constructed via an Arc and a small circle. There is a small issue with the rotate conflicting with the x and y axis's but this could be fixed easily with a Push and Pop I think dependant on whether I can nest them.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `rotate` : rotates on the center of the Arc.
  * `accentXa` : controls the X axis of the small circle.
  * `accentYa` : controls the Y axis of the small circle.
