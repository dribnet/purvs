## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Experimentation with symbols. I decided I wanted to use symbols to represent what different people in different stages (past present future) have and will teach me.

For the past photo (people running up hill) I used the symbol of a dragonfly which represents wisdom, change, transformation. All things in which those people led me to and taught me, which is of high value in my life even if it was not the most positive experience, and tends to be a common experience in most people so is an important stage to highlight in my opinion. For this one I wanted to have the symbol be quite large and make the viewer look across the image. 

For my present photo, taken at the zoo on a disposable camera after adventuring around Wellington to capture moments of the people who have taught me true friendship, love and care. I decided to use the heart symbol and cover the three friends who are the subject of the photo but subtly. 

I am happy with how the symbols are coming along, especially the dragon fly ones, now I just need to make the imagery of the people far more clear and not have the mask be weird which is definitely something I am struggling with.
