### Episode 08 Finer tuned version

jumping off from the original idea, i realized that the original concept three of the day/time change was to simple and rather plain. so i decided to remix the idea keeping the changing day/night concept's originality whilst applying a new sci-fi like digital clock design. 

(things Improved)
creating a pulse like movement in regards to time
unique layout style compromising of the standard
hours,minutes,secs with the am/pm
transitioning background depending on the current time.

the clock design is a reference to a 90's anime show called neon gensis evangelion, this also inspired the choice of clours used aswell

TUNE IN NEXT TIME!!
