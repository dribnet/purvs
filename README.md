## Part 2

My first face is inspired by Calcifer the fire in Howl's Moving Castle. The pupil, body and mouth size can change to express different levels of shock. The brightness can also be altered.

The second face explores having a varying shape and amount of spots. There is also a rotation and saturation control.

The last one is more complex. I chose a tiger. It has varying stripe length, head width and orange colours. The eye value is a discrete variable which determines if the eyes are open, half-closed or closed.
