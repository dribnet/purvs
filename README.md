PORTRAITS:

For my work in part 1 of the assignment I have created a portrait of Squidward and Gollum.

I think Squidward probably comes across better as he is naturally a cartoon where as Gollum is a CGI marvel! 

For Gollum I really tried to emphasise his large eyes and so I gave them the most detail in the hope it would make him more recognisable.
