From Points to Lines

There are 27 parameters in this code.
"lx1-lx13": The x-axis coordinate.
"ly1-ly13": The y-axis coordinate.
"size": The size of each ellipse.

The thinking expressed by my work shows the microscopic view of lines.
By placing some circles in an orderly manner which can show the general outline of letters and numbers. This also shows the process from points to lines. Furthermore, each small circle is also formed by lots of small points, so "point" can even be sait to exist in an abstract form, I think the alphabet will be more image and concrete by using this idea.
