## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today I am working on creating emphasis on the flowers in my design. I really want to show the different garidents and shapes that flowers make. As part of this I have been experimenting with using archs. I still have my image two flipped but it is possible I might change this to be the same as the others. I have found I just this line from the mask. I don't really like it but hopefully this is easy to fix with getting the leaves to then go the other way.

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
