Test alphabet

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by four parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size1` : diameter width of the second circle
  * `size2` : diameter height of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
