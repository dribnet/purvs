This is the first attempt at creating A B C that I'm happy with. Each letter is comprised of 3 individual lines, the paramaters being the co-ordinates of the start and end of each line. This leads to a total of 12 paramaters. I might want to consider seeing if I can narrow down these paramaters as this is the max allowed, but I do like the freedom of having complete control over the position and length of each line.
