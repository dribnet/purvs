## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I added a new grey mask to my images and changed the background to a slightly blurred mess of lines. I did this by giving each line a random x value between 1 and 5, and a random length value between 20 and 60.

The dark parts which are made of large, slightly see through circles, and tinged slightly red. I did this by accident because I thought that black was close to  255 and not 0, but I like the colour they turned out.

I have decided I am going to style the images based off glitch art, a style of digital art which takes inspiration from digital display glitches (pixels, bright colours, broken lines, etc). This goes  with my theme of graffiti, while still being art, is seen as not functional or fitting into society, and is normally rid of because it is seen as ugly. I want to try blend these ideas and colours (seen in artworks like these https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5d/e7/98/5de798bd10e1d6c92aa0f549075ca78f.jpg) into my pieces.


The theme I have chosen for my images is graffiti in the Wellington region. These specific images were taken in the abandoned military bunkers surrounding the city (specifically the Brooklyn windmill bunkers and Fort Ballance on Scorching Bay), where every surface is covered in colourful tags. The council doesn't bother to remove these works, so they layer up ontop of each other to create a chaotic yet beautiful pattern and texture. To me, this represents freedom of expression and art. This graffiti is not on any privately owned property, nor is it in the way of the general public. This is a form of art which is generally not acceptable to the civil eye, as it is disruptive and chaotic.

In my rendition of these pieces, I want to show off the chaos and energy these places possess. I want to celebrate the artwork done by these artists, rather than hide it.
