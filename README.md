## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

This is my fully completed alphabet. I wanted the characters and numbers ot be quite abstract in the sense that they don't really resemble English characters or Arabic numerals. I considered adding in an extra shape or colour for the number, but ultiamtely decided against it as it would have been quite jarring and I wanted all of the characters to flow on each from each other more seamlessly.
