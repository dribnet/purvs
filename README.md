### Clock 

This clock has 3 boxes. I am now working on different ways to display my clock in a visually appealing way that best suits my idea and concept. I have added my alarm feature and changed the colours of my clock to match the asthetic of my clock. I like how simple this clock is visually and then when the alarm goes off it goes crazy and changes colours etc. I am going to focus on picking the best visual way to represent my clock now for example with 3 boxes or 4 (which includes the millis).
