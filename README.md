## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

UPDATE #1: These are some images I took for a photography paper last year experimenting with colour, water and light. The masks follow the flow of the light and water which creates a abstract image. I would like to experiment with the mask code to get a more 3d feel.

UPDATE #2: Experimented with the masks in order to form a more defineable shape. Also played with the code to seperate what I see as the abstract form and what I see as the background. I am pretty happy with the results so far.

UPDATE #3: Experimented with the smartmask program, using an image of penguins. I projected these forms onto my abstract image, to see what kind of results I would get. The results here are mixed, but I think with some refinement and more careful placement so the images are clearer this could look interesting. I am not sure if I would prefer to use smartmask or photoshop at this point as photoshop allows for a bit more precision which could be important when working with a more abstract image such as this.

UPDATE #4: Decided today that I am not going to use the smartmask as my image is meant to be more abstract and the smartmask ends up taking away from the overall aesthetic by trying to create something more tangible. I did experiment today with using a custom shape. I experimented with polygons of different sizes, however I really do prefer the larger squares in the background as they fit together well and create this "glitchy" look in the background where the viewer can see things going on, but doesn't quite know what they are. I reduced the size of the offset circles to take into account how much bigger in scale this image is meant to be presented, as well as just increase the overall definition of the image. My original theme for this photo series was portraying Wellington spaces in a different light, so I have decided to pursue this further. The original photos are of rivers in Aro Valley, which have been manipulated using coloured light and shutter speed. The coding filter allows me to further abstract these photographs and push them further. I think this would be a really interesting idea to present to the public as it is a space they may have seen before, yet they wouldn't have seen it presented in this way before. The image is also meant to intrigue the viewer and get them looking closer at it to figure out what it is, which would be good fr a public exhibit.
