### Calcu-Clock - current build

Colour changes with time, minutes are represented as an addition problem, hours are represented as a subtraction problem. Alarm is a seconds math attack.

### Calcu-Clock - concept

Clock presents simple math problems where the solution is the current time. The point of which is to let children practice their mathematic skills often. The alarm function requires the user to solve 5-10 math problems before stopping.

### Maeda-Clock

Snapshot of the 8th Maeda clock, chosen because it seemed the easiest to learn p5.js library.
