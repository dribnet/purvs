## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


I am designing a 'font' to be used in a graphic design way, it is made from triangles and is not 100% totally readable as the mainstream and typical forms of the letter. I do not want the letters to be instantly recognisable but I do want them to have some resemblance and readability that they could be used in abstract graphic design. I want my letters to made from the most minimal amount of parameters possible. Doing this through triangles might be a little bit difficult. I might experiment with arcs rather than triangles. I wanted to use a limited colour scheme. I have set myself the challenge of trying to be good at using triangles since I have not really used them in my other designs in creative coding. 

Finishing the draft of my alphabet, It definitely needs a lot of refinement. But I am happy with my main idea and my progress in learning how to work with triangles since I have never used them before. I have begun to really emphasise my stroke as part of the design in creating the shape of a traditional letter in the english alphabet. 

Here are my parameters for each letter so far
  'triX1' - the first x point
  triY1 - the first y point
  triX2 - the second x point
  triY2 - the second y point
  triX3 - the third x point
  triY3 - the third y point
