   The idea of this concept is from the audio pitch. 
   The yellow arc show the level of pitch.
   For example the A tone is lower tha C tone, 
   the arc of A is more smooth than the arc of C.

  In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have add a scale function in it and make it all are Capital alphabet.
   
   x,y2 and x5,y5 control the blue arc
   x2,y3 and x6,y6 control the filled arc
   x3,2y and x7,y7 control the green arc
