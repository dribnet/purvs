Theme - Light and Shadow

Light and shadow are two very opposite existences, what I want to express is also this theme. Below the light, a description of the outline of a shadow.

Test :

I tried to use the vertical and horizontal lines to express my pictures. The surprise is that theu look unexpectedly blending; For the third one, I am still thinking about what to do so that these three artwork are stay in the same style.
