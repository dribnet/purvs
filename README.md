## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

26/05/20 - Experimentation 2
The images above are photos of the new years festival in Wellington 2020 processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html).

Image 1: this is a duck floating on water. I kept ellipses for the duck but made them larger. For the masked area, I masked the bottom half of the image (where the water surface is) and increased the rect width and decreased the height so it gives that watery effect.

Image 2: This was a floating fish. I did edit this image; it's only mirrored. I did this because there was a lot of empty space to the left because when I took this photo that's how I angled it. It looks great mirrored though.

Image 3: These are lanterns. I focused on the yellow and lights for this render.

I had an idea for this. If I decided to continue with this theme I sorta like the idea of a plain black background and then an object in the middle with a lot of contrast. I could make the background from the other images black through the power of photoshop. It would be cool seeing a consistent pixel pattern in my exhibition.
