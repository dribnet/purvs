## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Nearly finished all my characters. I just need to figure out how to do an 'X' using the shapes that I have. It is difficult as I would like to make it without making additional parameters just for one letter. Once I get the X down packed I can starting making other things like the interaction, exhibition Etc.

This current X is an emergency stand in just incase I cant figure it out. May be subject to change in the future :)

Currently I am sitting on a nice 10 parameters:
sizex
sizey
offsetx
offsety
cirsize1
cirsize2
ciroffsetx
ciroffsety
cir2offsetx
cir2offsety
