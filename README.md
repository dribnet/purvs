## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


I am designing a 'font' to be used in a graphic design way, it is made from triangles and is not 100% totally readable as the mainstream and typical forms of the letter. I do not want the letters to be instantly recognisable but I do want them to have some resemblance and readability that they could be used in abstract graphic design. I want my letters to made from the most minimal amount of parameters possible. Doing this through triangles might be a little bit difficult. I might experiment with arcs rather than triangles. I wanted to use a limited colour scheme. I have set myself the challenge of trying to be good at using triangles since I have not really used them in my other designs in creative coding. 

Playing around with numbers and getting to know my design better, definitely utilising the stroke in my design. My next step is to add in more variables to some letters and numbers (just another triangle) 

Here are my parameters for each letter so far
  'triX1' - the first x point
  triY1 - the first y point
  triX2 - the second x point
  triY2 - the second y point
  triX3 - the third x point
  triY3 - the third y point
