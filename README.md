## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This version of my code looks at taking out the dark parts of the background and using a smaller tile size. I am doing this to create a harsh contrast between the foreground and background.
These colour experiments are heaps of fun, but I think to progress I need to make a layered mask that highlights some of the more intricate background features of this. I also want to try some different patterns in the background/foreground to create more textures.
This version of the code doesn't look so good on input 2, but it is still an interesting  effect.


The theme I have chosen for my images is graffiti in the Wellington region. These specific images were taken in the abandoned military bunkers surrounding the city (specifically the Brooklyn windmill bunkers and Fort Ballance on Scorching Bay), where every surface is covered in colourful tags. The council doesn't bother to remove these works, so they layer up ontop of each other to create a chaotic yet beautiful pattern and texture. To me, this represents freedom of expression and art. This graffiti is not on any privately owned property, nor is it in the way of the general public. This is a form of art which is generally not acceptable to the civil eye, as it is disruptive and chaotic.

In my rendition of these pieces, I want to show off the chaos and energy these places possess. I want to celebrate the artwork done by these artists, rather than hide it.
