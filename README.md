### Updated clock with ellipses and current time

I have updated my clock with the current time of the computer. I have also added ellipses that go across the screen which follow this current time. As for right now I havent properly setup the clock properly as the ellipses dont move to the edge of the screen and also arent in tune with where they should be located as time moves on.
