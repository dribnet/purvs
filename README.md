## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

-Flower Glyph

I wanted to make my image look as though nature was taking over the person or like the person was vanishing into nature. Therefore I created a flower glyph. I masked the lines of the persons face and added this glyph to this specific part. I wanted to make it look like the person was taking the nature from the background as the background is quite computerised and harsh. I think I may want to try a different mask for the inside of her face so it is not the same pattern as my background. I have yet to use my own photographs but I know I want to have a portrait of someone and then an image of nature in the background. These three images just demonstrate some of the different variations of the flower glyph I tried.
