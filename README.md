### Abstracted Coconut Clock

I have continued my abstraction of my initial idea to have a coconut tree as my clock. I decided to i didn't like the bars and my previous idea and liked the look of something circular, taking the idea of a coconut itself. The three arcs are coloured based on a coconut, the green of the exocarp, the brown of the endocarp and the white of the inner flesh. I also added hands to give more of a classic clock look which i like. As opposed to putting numbers i wanted to keep it simple by just putting quarterly lines to break up the time abut further. I put little shadows just to give the clock a little more dimesion so it doesn't look so flat.
