## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Overall Summary 

The main idea of sorting out this Alphabet is to visually create a sense of doing exercise, so I called it “WORKOUT” as my font name. As shown in the page, the barbell/dumbbell consisting of three rectangles are the dominant part in the letter form, additionally I placed two levers which are lines separately in black and white. Besides black and white, other colors I picked are blue, mint green, yellow and also pink in the background. I aim to demonstrate a kind of ambience where the audience could hopefully be feeling relaxed, lively and fun.

For designing a specific shape of each letter, I initially sketched the draft of a rough layout on paper, determining how to organize the placement of different components and elements. Subsequently, I digitally experimented with each of the letters to figure out the detailed position on screen with the assistance of adjusting 20 parameters.

Besides font name, other picked words of my project are barbell, 12345678 and amuse.

“BARBELL” is an important element, “12345678” is for showing numbers’ visual shapes, “AMUSE” is a kind of mood state involved in this design.
