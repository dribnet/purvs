## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

- Friday 5:21pm:

I tried doing lines with my image but it didn't look so well, maybe I will try to play around with the code more. Changed colours of the transparent highlights that I added.

Will look at the code and play around with it more.

I couldn't commit from home and didn't want to break my files so I'll just write the day and what I changed because I'm still experimenting with my images and the code. I added a 3rd image- greyscale image too. With the masking I tried to see what it would be like to also mask bits of the background that aren't a part of the subject. Again, still experimenting, trying to see what images I will use and how I will implement the code with them.

I added in a different image of my dads tattoo that I took about 2 years ago. With my masking, I had a black background and coloured the patterns black, giving it a kind of highlight so the viewer can see the patterns.

I want to try and have some lines of some sort in the background in a different colour, while have the actual subject coded in a way that they become the focal point- will play with masking and code.

Also want to try with other images. Since my theme is Pasifika Identity in Aotearoa New Zealand I was thinking of not only having images of my family doing cultural performances, but other images of them participating in sports such as basketball because I have images of family that are in our home photo albums.
