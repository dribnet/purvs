### Windows 95 Clock Prototype

I based this design on the initial idea I had that I outlined in PhotoShop last week. It was somewhat difficult to separate the minutes into two bars. For now I donâ€™t have a working alarm but as it said in the assignment text I made the alarm status appear on the top bar to show it in alarm mode, and as the date is not passed to the clock function I can no longer place the date up there. I plan to have buttons that react to being clicked, a window that can be dragged around and an intuitive way to set an alarm in the future.
