I've started thinking more about what my theme will be and the movements I want to confey. With this first attempt I only worked on one face and have started developing the concepts that I will follow

At the moment I'm leaning towards pastel colours and a certain style of building faces. focusing on the rosy cheeks, small eyes and big nose. This goes along a sort of flat, minimalistic representation of animals.
