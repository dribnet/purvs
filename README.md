## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I wanted to play around with the colour, stroke and transparency. For this design I made the medium circle and the stroke the background colour and removed the transparency. This gives it a "cut-out" look. The little circle is partially transparent and white. I like how it looks when it overlaps with the background coloured parts, because it looks like it's pure white. I made the stroke width 4 so it could be clearly seen, even though I liked the way the thin stroke looked.

This is a simple looking design but so far I think it is my favourite.


The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
