This is the final sketch of my parametric faces. I have used toast faces with tomato eyes and avocado mouths. each piece changes scale and shape while the toast changes colour from bread, toast, and burnt.

I chose the tomatoes as eyes because of their shape and the core which looks like a pupil. I also chose avocado for the mouth due to its shape. Its orientation is to give the impression the toast is sad/scared, as it would be due to it inevitable fate.

The bread colouring represents the levels of toastedness and the shape changes as bread slices do depending on the loaf.
