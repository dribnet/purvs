Previously, the expressions on the faces were all random, but the faces themselves were all identical. I've now added a few randomized parameters to allow for some variation in face shape (particularly the curve of the cheeks and pointiness of the chin).

I still need to add variation in color, but am now quite satisfied that the faces look like different people and not just variations on the same.
