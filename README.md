## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

**May 20 2020**
Due to some limitations with my parameters, I don't think I am 100% able to go with the designs initially planned from my sketch. However, I will work around this and try to find more of a consistent pattern.

I plan to finish all my letters today. I don't have an idea on what my numbers will look like yet, but I'm sure i'll come up with it soon.

I have some sort of an idea on what to call my alphabet, I'm thinking of something to do with mathematic symbols maybe.

I updated the colour scheme! Initially I tried to go for three colours of pink, orange and blue, but I found that these colours didn't suit well together. After playing around I found that pink would be a suitable colour for all elements, since I wanted the colour of the circles to be pink.

I'm thinking of doing a stroke on top of a stroke to create more colour elements to my letters, but for now I will just focus on my letters to get it done!
