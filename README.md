Smartwatch watch face

I design this clock for using on Smartwatch or smartphone. So I focus on the functional and practical. The geometric graphics design would make the user more easy to read. 

In the centre of the clock have a little circle, it is gently changing the colour depends on the real-time millisecond. I use this colour animation to demonstrate the heartbeat effect in order to make the clock looks more humanely. 

The background colour will change to dark blue after twelve o'clock. It would help the user to know morning and afternoon.
