## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My idea is about a food culture. I want to communicate how differences of many food around the world. In the example, I choose a waffle, kimchi soup, and spaghetti. The waffle is representing of Western food culture. The kimchi soup is representing of Asian food culture. And the spaghetti is representing of Italian food culture.

The pixel on the food was looked a bit sensor on it, overmore likes an illegal image. I changed the background elements more bigger and added ellipses on the pixel of the food instead of rectangle. 

I was trying to add the randomness of elementspacing on custom pixel. It looked fine on the white mask but not on the black mask. It is recking a bit of elementspacing.
