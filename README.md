## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I tested out the smart mask on the second image which is the red orchid branch. It turned out pretty good but the inside pieces you can still see them so I think that i will used a the original mask. I like how the smartmask turned out but it isn't what i want. It was interesting to test it out non the less.
