## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I just did some small adjustments today, trying to find a balance with my layering so it's not too much. It's a bit more toned down but I like how it looks. I need to get some feedback regarding my theme and code so I can start taking the next steps if needed.

I've taken images from a recent visit to the Auckland Botanical Gardens, this place is very special to me. I absolutely love nature and landscapes. After experimenting with a more abstract approach, I want my works to represent how we've lost our ability to be at one with nature. We live in a fast-paced world viewing screen after screen, it alters how we view what was once so normal to us. Now, when we look at images through a screen, they're always altered, we don't know what is real. This is a dramatisation of the concept.
