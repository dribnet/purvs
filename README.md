## PS1 MDDN 342 2017


At this stage, I have focused on one face, and I want to give the randomizer the ability to customise the monsters colour, opacity, eyes, mouth and head tilt as well as the amount and size of the horns.

I have focused on my third monster, altering the colours, adding horns, and other elements, while also adding the ability for eyes of the monsters to look at the mouse position.

Unicorn monsters are less likely to appear than others, and there is controlled distribution on the size of the mouth too.

They are now randomly generated every second.
