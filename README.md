## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

With the code I wasn't sure what to do so I played around with the triangles and the rotate. I wanted to see how it would look if hte background ellipses rotated around and around but i cou;dn't get it to work so I skipped it for now. Changing the position of some of the triangles i ended up with this and I think it looks pretty interesting. I think it if I made them various thickens and changed the opacity of some of the triangles it would be better.
