Final README.

This should include a summary of all of the work leading up to the final version (which I am omitting in this example), so it should be longer than the other READMEs.

In my final version I have used a shifted grid layout with some jitter.

This is Part 1's synopsis.
What I have had trouble with is the transference from side view to front face view. At this stage, my eyes are in front view but I have the mouth look like side view. Hopefully continuing along, I should fix this.'
