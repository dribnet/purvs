## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2
Based on the feedback I had received for my design and my own judgment I elected that the next steps from my previous designs should be making the design fit within the bounding box and making it more readable. Conjointly the strengths are that it was pretty and recognizable as an alphabet.
So naturally, I spent the last few weeks making it as ugly and unrecognizable as possible while completely ignoring the bounding boxes and readability. I'm making the most of the unregulated experimentation I experience in my sleep-deprived state. I do however like the circles idea, and it reminds me of the logo for the TATE art galleries. I've gotten pretty good at halftone patterns and most of my projects tend to contain a grid of circles at least somewhere so I think I might as well lean into my strengths and expand upon that idea.
