## PS2 MDDN 342 2017


PART 4

I have continued to work on the properties of my face and have created the following paramters that can be adjusted and have adjuted them to the 100 faces as follows;

1) pupil shade - intensity of stare
2) eye colour - emotion (blue being happy)
3  teeth heigh - adjusted where needed to better sit in the mouth 
4) wide eyes 
5) squinting eyes

The majority of these properties are related to the expression of the eyes, however,  this was the core feature of my original PS1 face and it's random properties which I have tried to bring forward into this work.
