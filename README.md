## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I looked at manipulating colour using an if statement. I played around with values until I got a look that I liked. Image 2 was a problem because there was a lot of green and dark tones, so either it manipulated nothing at all or the entire thing. I solved this by bringing in a new branch on my if statement, this branch would take anything in between pure black and white and make something new out of it.
I decided to make these colour accents with my lines. As well as this, I changed my lines to be somewhat slanted, it gave a very blended and soothing look combined with the accents. I played around with the grey element on image 2 specifically.
Colour-wise I wanted an orange, to make the image seem more lively, but it looked really contrasting and out of place. After some messing around I decided on a soft blue colour.
I quite like how this pop of colour looks (especially on image 3), it adds a new element to all of my images. Creating a different feel. In future, I will look at making it so my images relate to eachother a lot more. Deciding abstract pops of colour or subtler blending. I will clean up my masks so that its more specific.

I've taken images from a recent visit to the Auckland Botanical Gardens, this place is very special to me. I absolutely love nature and landscapes. I feel that after the long amount of time we all spent indoors, it's nice to remember just how peaceful and beautiful our planet really is.
