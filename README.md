## Powers of 10 PRINT

This program is based on my sketch from part 3.

It creates a randomly generated map using noise .

The first and second zoom levels give you a zoomed out version of the map, allowing you to see it from a
general perspective. The 3rd zoom level provides more detail and starts showing key highlights from the map.
This allows you to zoom in further to investigate these features. The final zoom level gives you much more detail,
by showing all the small shapes and features of the landscape.

The program has 4 biomes : Tiaga, Jungle Forest, Decidious forest, and Lake. This allows for more variation and some
interesting variation at further zoomed out levels. All of the biomes have different spawn rates of the terrain pieces,
and hopefully encourage some interesting features when it's more zoomed in.
