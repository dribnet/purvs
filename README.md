## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have changed the three images to random photos and paintings I did a few years ago and created masks for them. I havn't changed the algorithim yet but over the weekend I will have a think about how I would like these images to appear as well as what themes I could explore with the images that will replace these ones.
