## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Main Concept:

Create an alphabet inspired by the Bauhaus typography from the 1920's. This type style foucsed on geometric shapes, vibrant colours, balanced layouts with harmony and sans-serif letters in upper case. In my type I am wanting to create this style through using 3 simple shapes, a semi-circle, a line and a full circle. Each shape has a different colour similar to the Bauhaus type.


The ten parameters per letter:

- circDiam: the size of the circle
- CircleX: the x position of the circle
- CircleY: the y position of the circle 
- lineX: x position of the rectangle 
- lineY: y position of the rectangle 
- lineH: height of the rectangle 
- lineW: width of the rectangle 
- flipX: Arc x to swap numerical value with y
- flipY: Arc y to swap numerical value with x
- StrokeW: Changes the thickness of the line


Changed the values of the circler to either be at size 50, or at size 70 for further refinement. The rectangles are also either at at size 30 x 60 or they are at 90 x 20. This gives a more set look. I still have a few letters to fix up though that don't fit into either of these numbers. I want to try and refine the alphabet to be somewhat linked to the sound that each letter makes, but this has been made very difficult to do as each letter sounds very different.
