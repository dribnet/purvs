## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Concept:
This alphabet is made out of two transparent arcs, which create the approximate form of english letters where they overlap. The goal is to make a full, somewhat readable alphabet from only two arcs. The bluish arc sits to the left and top, and the red to the right and bottom, in that order of priority. As it stands, this totals 10 parameters per letter.

====================================================================================

Various refinements

Made small refinements to a few letters. Tried adding an extra arc which drew at the same position and size as one of the others, but with a different start and end point (Which I should have probably bushed before binning..oops), in order to make leters like Q and R easier. It looked awful though, so I axed it pretty quickly.
