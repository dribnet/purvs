## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

after spending last session playing with shapes and parameters i have added a grotesk font to the files for me to keep an eye on each character and get a feel for the kind of shapes i need to make.

I think I am going to try the triangle style that i  began exploring last week.

I am now playing with the idea of using cyrillic instead of the latin alphabet just for funzies

If i do choose to continue with the cyrillic im going to have to re work my sketch ideas significantly though

tried doing the first four characters of the cyrillic alphabet in my existing style and i have to say im not a fan.
