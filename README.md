## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Name: Focus

Well, this is a bit of a trip. There's a few different things to cover here, so lets get to it.

I really wasn't particularly inspired by this project. Typically I like to set myself some extra rules for a project in order to force myself in a very specific direction (like avoiding traditional ergonomic shapes in the joint project for DSDN 111 last year, or displaying numbers without using them, etc). This project doesn't really allow that very well. The ruleset of the project encourages you to be more additive than subtractive with your workflow, so I started this out stumped and went through a couple different concepts before I settled on one.

The "Comfort Concept" commit is the first one. At that point I was just looking at places I find comfortable, and was going to progress from the real world into a digital one. The images were going to have soft, painterly backgrounds around some sort of window, which would look like it was raining. While this I think was pretty solid conceptually, execution on it proved rather annoying and was hard to make look right. In addition, it directly inspired where I went next, which was actually the opposite of it.

The next place I went was the commit "Stress Concept". The one linked in the purview is actually my last shot at that. I saw the rainy window in my PC screen came out looking kinda glitchy and warped due to how bright it was, which I thought was a cool effect and I thought would portray stress well. This one was to have a similar layout, with a backdrop and an object that produced stress. The backdrop was meant to look out of focus, while the object had that glitchy stress effect and drew in your eyes, showing how stress can make it hard to really see where you are.

This just didn't work out well and I spent a while lost before settling on what I actually ended up doing, which is about objects of interest and sentimentality. The idea was to look at how certain, seemingly random objects can be the most important thing in the room to someone. Pictures were taken in parts of my house I spend a lot of time in, each having one highlighted object of interest. In the final product, the background is supposed to look as though it was sketched with pencil or charcoal and then left unfinished, while the object appears to have been painted, making it much clearer. If it wasn't obvious, this is supposed to show how the object may be the only thing there perceived as important, despite the other things around them having more purpose (Most notably, in the background of the model car is my glasses, the blue controller is next to an otherwise identical black one, and the cube is sitting on top of a work book).

To be honest, I can't say I'm totally happy with this project, but at this point I'm just really tired. This has definitely been my weakest work in this class this year, but I think it conveys it's message and is pretty nice to look at. If I were to do this again, I'm not really sure what I'd change. My biggest problem here was just finding inspiration, and I can't really just choose to be inspired differently on a second attempt. It is what it is, I guess.
