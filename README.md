## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've started my alphabet, I'm keeping the same concept as my sketch, I like the idea of a slight abstract element (somewhat readable with a mix of upper and lower) and I think it will be further implemented with more complex letters. I've also started experimenting with colour palettes. I think a vivid colour palette should reflect the quirky fun nature of my alphabet. 

The parameters per letter:
  offsetx - the x offset of the letter components
  offsety - the y offset of the letter components
  triangleX1 - first x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY1 - first y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX2 - second x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY2 - second y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX3 - third x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY3 - third y co-ordinate of the triangle
  arcSizeX - arc length on the x axis
  arcSizeY - arc length on the y axis
  arcStart - beginning of the arc in degrees
  arcEnd - end of the arc in degrees
