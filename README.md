##VINPIXEL

From the very outset of this project, I wanted to create a font that was completely inspired by pixel art and vintage computer type. I have tried incorporating fonts like these in my design work for other papers this year because I love the retro and simplistic design language.

Another thing that stuck around in spirit is the concept that I wanted to make a very specific type of interpolation. I didn't know at the time that this would be quite challenging and something not a lot of my classmates desired to do. Really, my main inspiration was after I had thought of my initial concept, we were shown a project called [Type me, Type Me Not by Peter Cho](http://www.typotopo.com/typemenot/index.html). The third example which was one square that 'flipped' between letters as you typed was the fuel I needed to take thus project to the next level. What I really loved about Peter Cho's project was its ability to have the 'retro pixel' look while still being able to being something new and interesting to the table, I knew that I wanted to create a sort of spiritual successor to his project. The first interpolation that ...
