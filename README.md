## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Grid Techniques:
I explored the grid techniques and have made this as a background layer for my image. I'm not 100% sure if i'll integrate this into my assignment but if I do, it would be very little. I feel like there's too many pixels for the image but it was nice to be able to try out different techniques for the grids!
