## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Part 1

First idea - 05/05/20

My idea is to have a continuous line with a set amount of vertices along it, and each of these vertices can be manipulated depending on the letter. This idea came from talking abouot the project with my boyfriend, who suggested a worm that bends into each letter. I am starting out with only 3 vertices. Each letter has the same straight line as a starting position. It will be an uppercase alphabet. I need to make it more visually interesting and colourful as well, as it looks pretty boring at the moment. 
It is made using a beginShape() and endShape(), with no fill so just the outline can be seen. This creates a continuous line without having to draw each line seperately.

Refining ABC's 

I changed the colours to be more earthy and made the overall forms bigger and thicker. i had to add ROUND stroke effects so it wasn't all weird and pointy. 

My letter parameters so far are simply the x,y coordinates of each point.
  "pointoneX" - first vertex X
  "pointoneY": - first vertex Y
  "pointtwoX": - second vertex X
  "pointtwoY": - second vertex Y
  "pointthreeX": - third vertex X
  "pointthreeY": - third vertex Y

 Part 2 

 Designing alphabet - 06/05/20

 Today I moved all of my code so that it fits into the other js files. I have started using the editor to create the rest of the letters,  and it has been much easier than sketching on paper. I think at this point I can stick with just the three points, which leaves me a lot of room for adding details later. I want the letters to look like they are from an ancient tomb, I am not necessarily going for legibility with my language. A good visual example for me is the language from Zelda Breath of the Wild (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/8a/cf/5b8acfe2f1b1ebfef198778b7d8ad0a2.jpg), or Greek inscriptions like this (https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/fc/a5/65fca596a021dbd1b9e0df6f26efc52c.jpg).
