## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

Merged the code and started to add some of my shape layers and colours into it. I'm finding it quite difficult to get my head around and at the moment the shape on the right is going a bit weird when I zoom in. I'll continue to add elements of my old code into this one and hopefully I'll understand the code better as I go.
