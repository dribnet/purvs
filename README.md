PLAYING AROUND WITH INTERPOLATION

I played around with the interpolation between the letters. I was happy with how it originally was because the transition between the letters was smooth enough for my liking. Since all my letters contain every shape nothing flew off the page which I was happy with.  I felt like I could still make some small adjustments, so I decided to speed up the arcs interpolation from start to finish. Overall I'm happy with the outcome of the interpolation of each letter and number.

The thirteen parameters per letter:
  * `rectX` : x location of the rectangle
  * `rectY` : y location of the rectangle
  * `rectX2` : x location of the second rectangle
  * `rectY2` : y location of the second rectangle
  * `arcSize` : overall size of arcs 
  * `arcX` : x location of the first arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the first arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the first arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the first arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the second arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the second arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the second arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the second arc
