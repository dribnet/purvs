## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

My alphabet is made up of three semi-transparent circles and a line. The line was added in because I realised that three circles was not enough to create unique enough letters. The line is the same colour as the background so it looks like it's cutting the circle. So far I've only finished some letters.

I wanted my letters to touch. This means they don't fit inside the bounding box.

I removed the offset parameter because It was no longer needed. However I added in parameters needed for the line.

The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
