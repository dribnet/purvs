Today I finally turned my pen sketch into a full p5 sketch using parameters. This took quiet a lot of time because my letters are slanted and I am using quads so have to code every point of the shapes. At the moment i have over 20 parameters so my next step is to reduce it down to 20. I only realised this after completing it so i will have to work hard to not compromise the design while changing the way my shapes are layered. I thinking about swapping some of the quads out for triangles or rectangles so that less parameters are used.

i was also going to add more details to the letters but the parameter limit makes that impossible without a simpler font.
