Changed the default input images to one of a Chinese junk dock and a fishing boat sailing infront of a warship
Also made and added their respective mattes

Changed ellipses to lines for drawing water and muddled around adding loops within the if statement to independantly
change quantity of shapes drawn over each matte 

My two main ideas at this stage is either water or space themed, water because the code allows for a water effect to be made.
space would allow me to draw lines to make the subject look like its moving.

So far with the water theme I want to maybe highlight the junk in the centre frame, maybe use another matte to highlight it
with more detailed pixels
