Part 2: My Theme & Adding Images

My theme focuses on the beauty of house plants leaves. I wanted to highlight the detailed unique shapes and details of the leaves. The three plants I have photographed are called the 'Peacock Plant', 'Nerve Plant', and 'Ivy'. I really liked how different the three plants were and I especially loved the colour of the nerve plant.

I created a mask for the Ivy plant image using circles. I wanted to test how that would appear with the image. But in my next experiments I want to create masks using greys and whites. I want to create masks outlining the leaves while also using solid shapes such as triangles.
