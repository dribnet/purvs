Episode 04

I have finally fixed the remaining letters all the way from s to z with the angled versions of the letters thus far.

I have also completed the transitions for the letters changing but a new issue arose when the transitions of the letters were not showing.. hopefully i can fix this issue as soon as possible.

	(A TOTAL OF 20 values for each rect/circle)
  * this values goes onto 4 eg pos_x4 for each rect
  * `pos_x` : x position of the rect
  * `pos_y` : y position of the rect
  * `width_` : width of the rect
  * `height_` : height of the rect
  * the remaining values go on as pos_x2, pos_x3, pos_x4 and so on.

  
  * The value for x and y for the ellipse is fixed, x = 50 and y 135
  * `c_width` : width of the ellipse is stored here
  * `c_height` : height of the ellipse is stored here
