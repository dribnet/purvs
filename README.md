## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process and Development

I decided to keep my portrait images and work further with thoes images. I really like the fine details of the facial features, emotions and experssions, so I decided to base my theme around that from my images. So I played around with the code and made a distinct difference from the background to the main subject. I masked each photo so that there will be a contrast between the faces and body to the background.
