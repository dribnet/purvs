EXP1 Colour Research 

This version was my original colour choice idea. I like how colourful it is and I think the animation in the interaction is beautiful. Yet it looks way too busy in the exhibition and it is hard for viewers to read or focus on the words. Therefore, I have changed the colours into the ones in my final which are more subtle and in a lighter colour.

From
col1 = "#ffcc74"; //yellow
col2 = "#ff7991"; //hot pink
col3 = "#4fc4d8"; //blue

To 
col1 = "#f9d9e9"; //light pink
col2 = "#c3e6e7"; //blue
col3 = "#fefefe"; //white
