Face Sketches

Sketch two recognisable faces using P5.js

Face #1 is Rapunzel from Disney's tangled. I used a technique borrowed from Lewis Brewer, which basically involved plotting points on photoshop and using the co-ordinates to draw custom shapes. 

Face #2 is Ariel from Disney's little mermaid. I decided to stick within the same general theme for the two faces, and although I used similar techniques for both, I created two fairly different variations on the original characters.
