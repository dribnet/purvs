Progress

I played around with the shapes that were a but difficult to draw like the j, g and a few others. I also drew the numbers and the ? which were easy as I used some of the letters as a base/starter for the numbers and manipulated them into the number, I also decided to use the whole canvas for the numbers unlike the lower case letters. I kept the same 3 colours but I made sure that the colours were alternating and the same colour wasn't always at the top or bottom.

The parameters per letter:
  * `width` : for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `height`: for my arcs so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `arcx` : x position for my arcs and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `aarcy` : y position for my arcs and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `llinex` : I have 2 x positions for my line and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `liney` : I hvae 2 y positions for my line and I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
