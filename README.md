I made the first 3 letter of my alphabet, I'm not sure about the colours yet but I think I will have it a solid colour as having the centre transparent would be strange. I like how the arcs all the same size. I think I will keep them all the same size and just changed the rotation and position of then. 
The parameters I used are 4
Pos2x is the x position for the outer arcs
Pos2y is the y position for the outer arcs
Pos3x is the x position for the inner arcs
Pos3y is the y position for the inner arcs
They are drawn by individually by calling and rotating the outer and inner arcs and setting the position to the place I want them.
