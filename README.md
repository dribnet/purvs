## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My final project was based of my interest in large stained glass windows. I've always been fascinated by the transparency through
the colours of the glass, this is a concept that I wanted to itterate with my letters. I decided to use the triangle shape and 
play around with the opacity of the fill to reveal a third colour between the 2 shapes. This created more volume and made 
my design more dynamic as it emulated the stained glass window effect with the light peering through the glass. Early when
designing my shapes I had the intention of making my design abstract with the overlay of the shapes and the hard edges of 
the triangle. Playing around with the positioning was fun and going through trial and error of different colours of the background and
fill of the shapes was a complementary learning experience. One thing that stays consistant in stained glass windows is that they have 
white edges to break up the different shapes. This was a design decision that I made later in the project that I think really brought my design 
to life. With the complementary addition of the white dividing up the triangles and it blending into the background canvas.  
After countless re designs and adjusting the points of the triangles I finally believe I found a alphabet that best complements my 
concept and idea. Changing the background to white solidified my decision of my design because it really emphasises the letter 
characters and fill of the triangles as the black and previous light blue washed out the characters making the characters look dull. 
With my numbers I decided to not add any oerlay or opacity simply due to confusion and readability. It was important that you can identify
the letters from the numbers; I made sure that I kept the same colours so that it all looked cohesive. Overall the style is tidy, readible, 
colourful and exciting!
