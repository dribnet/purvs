## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

Started with my new code idea which is to use lines to represent the letters. 

I drew out all the letters on paper and ran into some problems. When I draw a lettter like C there needs to be a gap inbetween the lines to show the open part of the C so that it doesn't look like an O. Hazel suggested creating a shape that will match the background colour and go over the lines to give it the illusion of space inbetween.

I have also decided that there will be 4 lines drawn for each letter and there will be an even space inbetween each line.

The eight parameters per letter:
  * `Yshift1` : top of line position for first line
  * `Yshift2` : top of line position for second line
  * `Yshift3` : top of line position for third line
  * `Yshift4` : top of line position for fourth line  
  

  * `length1` : length/ bottom of line position for first line
  * `length2` : length/ bottom of line position for second line
  * `length3` : length/ bottom of line position for third line
  * `length4` : length/ bottom of line position for fourth line
