PART 3: RANDOMISE

This README explains my changes for part 3 of assignment 1. 

I have developed face 1 from part 2 (which began as a questionable gollum look-alike in part 1).

I chose to use face 1 as it had all 5 parameters in use for adjusting different features of the face (eye size and direction, brow height, mouth width, ear size). Therefore, I felt that this would lend the greates amount of variety for the random outputs.
