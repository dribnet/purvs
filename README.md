FOCUSEDRANDOM / WEIGHTED SELECTION 

I changed all my parameters to use focusedRandom() as I was using an array and the random() function to select a value for my discrete variables. I changed them to the focusedRandom() and just needed to tweak my code particularly the if statements to use '<' instead of '==' as focusedRandom seems to provide a decimal number between the min and max. I have played around a bit with the  'fous' and weighted selection and so far I have made my variables so that the faces are most likely to be at the largest scale with the biggest smile curvature.  At the moment I have left my ears and other variables as random as possible but I will refine them further once I have worked out how I want the distribution to work and gotten a little more used to the focusedRandom() method.
