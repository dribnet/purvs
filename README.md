FINAL EPISODE 0000000000008

I know all of my gits wont make any sense at all, due to the way i commited through my process but. Sorry if you also have to cipher not just my actual alphabet, but as well as my process..


## INSPIRATION

The pigpen cipher (alternately referred to as the masonic cipher, cipher, Napoleon cipher, and tic-tac-toe cipher) is a geometric simple substitution cipher, which exchanges letters for symbols which are fragments of a grid. The cipher is shaped directly into how the letters are viewed in a grid startng from ABCDEFGHI following on to the next batch. The main idea that i wanted to do for this code is to create an alphabet that cannot be easily understood, but will and only be understood by those who know the cipher.

## PROCESS

The letter form started as 4 standard rect, which form the very first 9 letters of the alphabet, the circle was created to form the rest of the remaining alphabet, along with the added final parameter of a rotation to form the remaning rotated variations of the alphabet. 

Understanding firstly how the code work for me was the hardest thing to do in this project. Since im not used to making code from another source other than my own. But once i finally got to understanding it. I just had to figure what needed to be done. In this cases adding parameters and creating the necessary transition for the change in letters.

The ending result was the creation of alot of parameters for each of the rect, which i really wanted to shorten, without breaking the entire code. But the end result of this downside was a positive side, which gave my transitions a unique smooth transition that i really liked and was unexpected.

## CONCLUSION

the many use of my parameters ended with a unique flow transition that i didnt forsee all at the cause of having a huge parameter library. But despite this downside i enjoyed and learnt an interesting connection between a library of parameters and how it interwined well into the changeing transition of letters.

the ending parameter Number was 20, and this could have been way bigger bumped up to 25 if i added to the moving feature which was discarded in order to keep the clarity of the cipher code without disruption, and i didn have enough time to properly debug that feature.
