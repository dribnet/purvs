## New colour scheme

I decided to try changing my colour scheme as I was thinking about how to make my exhibition have a visually appealing theme. I went for an autumnal colour scheme to match with the leaves but with a more considered colour palette than just green and brown. I like how this looks and I think it gives a more peaceful and natural mood than the previous colour scheme.

I currently have 9 parameters;
	"offsetx": X position of the first leaf
    "offsety": Y position of the first leaf
    "leaf2Posx": X position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "leaf2Posy": Y position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "rotate1": rotation angle of the first leaf
    "rotate2": rotation angle of the second leaf
    "rotate3": rotation angle of the stick
    "stickPosx": X position of the stick in relation to first leaf
    "stickPosy": Y position of the stick in relation to first leaf
