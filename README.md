## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Thanks to the feedback from Phoebe, the boundary boxes around my letters are fixed and in their proper position. I have also changed the background measurement line colors in each of the files. Before they were a dark blue that was way to hard to see, now they are a light gray that is visible but doesnt take away from the overall letter design infront. I am still yet to complete the exhibition and maybe touch up some letters.

Currently I am sitting on 10 parameters:
sizex
sizey
offsetx
offsety
cirsize1
cirsize2
ciroffsetx
ciroffsety
cir2offsetx
