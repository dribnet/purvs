New Clock Design

I've been playing around with a few different clock designs but they've mostly been a bit too ambitious and I hadn't gotten out of the early stages. For this one I decided to take my last working clock design and switch it on its head, with the numbers on the clock moving and the single hand being static. Gives the clock a new visual dynamic while also keeping relatively basic. Ye, cool
