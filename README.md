## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


On second look, I found notes on why I was doing these obscured portraits when I was in France. So, what I had semi jokingly described as a series of obscured portraits of people in France actually had a deeper meaning. The rationale needs a little bit further work though, so I will update that in the next readme.
As far as the renderer at this point, I am just working to see what sorts of pixel densities and passes will perhaps work for my custom shapes.
