## PS4 Infinite LandScape Part 1

Just took images of my problem set 3, which will be the what I base my ps4 off. I want to extend what I did in ps3 into the infinite landscape, I will do this by making it when you zoom in, it reveals details such as vegatation and trees and maybe some other objects if lag permits. I really liked the isometric view point, and hope it will translate well to the framework we will be using for ps4.
