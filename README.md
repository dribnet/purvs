I was fairly satisfied with the natural distribution for most of the parameters. Therefore I left most of the focusedRandom parameters alone.

The only values I felt would be improved through the addition of distribution variables, were eye number and teeth value.

I distributed the eyes to have a higher focus at a mean of two eyes. This made the instances of three and one eye more rare. I distributed the teeth to have a very low focus with a mean more geared towards no teeth. This meant that teeth would be a rarer occurence.

When looking at creating stronger focused distribution for other areas I felt that the natural variety of the design was lost, and that the use of focused distribution was hurting the overall composition.
