Part 4: Tour Zoom function (re-invented for 3D)
Since my design is in spacial 3D, having a tour feature, where it moves between the set points. With the added functionallity of being able to smoothly "tour" between the set points, you can view different set points on the control panel.


<hr>
here are the button based controls:
- Arrow_up: move up
- Arrow_down: move down
- Arrow_left: move left
- Arrow_right: move right
- "+" Key : zoom in
- "-" Key : zoom out
