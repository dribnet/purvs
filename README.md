## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I found that there was a small gap in between my initial framing and the highlighted part of the facial features. With Tom and Phoebe's help, I've managed to solve this problem. I've changed the color of the frames to make the highlighted parts more obvious. I've also deleted one of the gray shades because I found that it didn't have much effect on the whole image. I also realized that I didn't have to make a 'let' variable for each of my if/else statements and changed all the tile sizes to 5.5.
