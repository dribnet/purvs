### Clock Update

My Line clock is linear representation of time, I wanted to change the way time way displayed as it is usually shown in a circular or numerical fashion. The clock is a little hard to read but this was intentional to keep the look of the clock abstract. I did this by making the clock linear so that when the clock hits midnight the canvas is wiped and the clock starts fresh. The hours move down the page with the minutes, seconds and milliseconds moving across the canvas together.

My latest clock is what I am most happy with, the buildup to the alarm is smoother and when the alarm does start it does what an alarm does best. I am glad I made the change from my original clock idea as I was stumped as to how I would integrate the hours without making it look totally out of place, this was the part of the proejct that I struggled with the most. I feel like by using the hours, minutes and seconds all in one line it really tidied up the look. My project as a whole is nothing crazy technically but I feel that the overall aesthetic of it is where I wanted to put the most attention. I am very happy with the execution and concept of my project.
