Make some minor tweaks to my letters: M, W, X, U, V and F. These were the letters I wasn't very happy with, but I feel quite a lot better about them now. Small tweaks here and there make it much more legible. I've also named my font! 

"Spillage"

Named for the unfortunate event where I spilled coffee all over my laptop keyboard at the start of this project.




So far my parameters include:
  "size"    = hieght of ellipse
  "sizeW"   = width of ellipse 
  "offsetx" = x position offset from origin
  "offsety" = y position offset from origin
  "rectL"   = length of rectangle
  "rectW"   = height of rectangle
  "radi"    = radius of rectangle corners
  "ellPosx" = x position of the ellipse
  "ellPosy" = y position of the ellipse
