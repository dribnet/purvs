## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

  idea 1: draw the design out of circles with varying opacities so it has a sorta ghost-like effect. I could use true/false features to make cloudy effects in the back. The design I did in class today is like a super basic verison of what I eventually want to do

 I started playing around with possible shapes for my letters in code in the sketch.js file. Some of them look more effective than others so I think it'll be a good idea for me to go through and make every letter using only 2 circles as cutouts to see if this idea would actuall work. The "E" and "F" I made don't look that much like the actual letters, but I think that they're close enough that it'll still work.
