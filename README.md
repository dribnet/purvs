Totally forgot to post updates here but so far I decided to remain with using the class example which was done during one of the studio sessions. Why? because, I like the "bubbly blob/slime" look and I want to relate my alphabets to that idea. Here is what I have created so far. The next post will be the alterations to improve the code in order to fultil the idea of slime. 

14 para per letter:

r1x, r1y - r4x, r4y: 
t1x, t1y - t3x, t3y:
