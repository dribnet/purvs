### Times of Life


My idea for the clock is to have a traditional clock face in the centre and then have other "clocks" on the outside exept they won't be showing the real time they will be showing how of something happens in the world e.g. how often a baby is born which is every 14 seconds. I am yet to think of an idea for an alarm, but maybe something like the clocks shaking or rattling.


I have done some research and have found out that there are 4.3 births every second, 79.9 marriges a minute and 3.6 elderly deaths a minute.
I am hoping to use this information for the clocks around the main clock and aim for the have a an "alarm" go off everytime an event like this happens. I was thinking of them maybe flashing colours or changing colours when the "alarm" goes off.
I am hoping to find more statistics of life events like this and how often they occur per second/minute/day etc.
