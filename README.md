## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of paekakariki hill processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). My friends and I went to watch the sunset :D

Image 1: I was exrpimenting with strokes. I gave the rect a large stroke weight and it made the hill look more like a painting. As the sky I kept them as an ellipse because I wanted them to still seem like clouds. I actually added smaller rectangles top top too.

Image 2: Using a more stretched technique I used rects and ellipse with an extreme height integer.

Image 3: I tried to make this image look more like we were at a beach. Once again I used the same technique I did with the duck floating on the water. This effect makes it look like flowing water. As fr the unmasked area, I made the pointsize very small with a large stroke weight so it looks like sand.
