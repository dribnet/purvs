I have started creating my wallpaper pattern. I wanted it to have a sci-fi feel so decided to persue Hexagon grids. I couldn't quite figure out how to get a full grid with them spaced correctly so will continue to improve this. I chose a dark background colour with a monocramtic fill and a bright blue stroke. This to me seemed appropriate to the Sci-fi asthetic.
