### Butterfly Clock

I decided to alter my original idea of having birds to butterflies. To create this clock, I combined a few of my ideas together to create the most practical solution. I decided to have my butterflies moving in a more orderly fashion, otherwise it would be quite difficult actually being able to tell the time. I also decided to have a plain background so the focus would be on the butterflies.
