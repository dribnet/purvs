## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
So after leaving last class i had an idea that i wanted to explore, i re-read the breif and i thought my idea wasn't that personal except that the photos would be important people to me. I thought about things that were important to me, and what made the person i am today. A big factor of this was where i was brought up, Bay of Islands. I knew i had a bunch of photos of special places and moments from over the years, so i collected the top 3 that directly referenced my home. So first image is one of my family highland cattle, the next is a photo i took of a small apple and strawberry picked from my mums garden, then finally last is a view from a track that ive grown up walking along since i was 5.
