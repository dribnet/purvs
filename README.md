(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Each of my letters is composed with two round lines and two circles. All me lines and circles are not fixed, so they can have much different combinations.
=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].
>>>>>>> upstream/part2

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
