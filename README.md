Development

I decided for my alphabet I would use lines, ellipses and arcs to create my shapes, I currently have 16 paramaters but depending if using all those shapes are nessecary then I might get rid of a shape.

The parameters per letter:
  * `width` : for my ellipses so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `height`: for my ellipses so I can manipulate the shape of it.
  * `offsetx` : x position for all my shapes but I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
  * `offsety` : y position for all my shapes but I defined them by adding in the first letter of what the shape is.
