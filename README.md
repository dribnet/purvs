## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I changed the range of random into larger one, from 0 - 5 to 0 - 40, and now the different size of flower is visible. Also, I solve the problem of the random size of each leaf of one flower. I think that is because I put the random function in a wrong place. Previously, I put the random in the place that drawing leaves. After I move the random function to the translate part, the problem has solved and all the leaves in one flower are in the same size.
Next step I will try to render a high resolution result to see if there is something I can refine.
