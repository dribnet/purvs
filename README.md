## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme
Water cycle

I chose three image from three different weather to explain my theme. 


Elements
At this stage, I was trying to show the process of the water cycle. And I used different elements with different colors in my design. But it seems it is not really recognizable.


Smartmask
Because there are two parts in my input images. One of them is the sky. Another one is the land. They are not specific objects. And I checked the masking categories. It didn't mention the sky or the land. Therefore, I didn'y use smartmask in this project.
