### Outrageous clock

Describe the idea for your clock here - replacing this text.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your 
image above. You can also include
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
preview.jpg (960x500) and thumbnail.png (230x120).



The first idea I have for my clock will include day and night cycles, changing to a lighter colour during PM hours and will eventually fade to a darker colour as it turns to AM. As you can see in the image above, boxes will be selected for both hours and minutes. So far I want to have a sun for PM hours and a moon for AM hours, but the amount of numbers for the minutes section underneathe the clock will be too great. Therefor I am experimenting with different ideas to solve this probelm (Maybe it only displays the current time instead).
