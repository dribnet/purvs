## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Finished utilizing my letters into the proper paranter system utilizing 16 parameters. Each latter is made from the same 4 color coded shapes.


Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
