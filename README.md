So this is my idea which i have created my alphabet. I have a focused on the lower case styles of letters, along with this every letter and number is made up from 4 lines. ALso each letter and number has one thicker line which is the most stable point of the letter/number. By applying all these rules i have created my sans serif font. 

The 8 parameters per letter are now:
  * ptx - X cord for 1st line point
  * pty - Y cord for 1st line point
  * ptx2 - X cord for 2nd line point
  * pty2 - Y cord for 2nd line point

  * ptx3 - X cord for 3rd line point
  * pty3 - Y cord for 3rd line point
  * ptx4 - X cord for 4th line point
  * pty4 - Y cord for 4th line point

  * ptx5 - X cord for 5th line point
  * pty5 - Y cord for 5th line point
  * ptx6 - X cord for 6th line point
  * pty6 - Y cord for 6th line point

  * ptx7 - X cord for 7th line point
  * pty7 - Y cord for 7th line point
  * ptx8 - X cord for 8th line point
  * pty8 - Y cord for 8th line point
