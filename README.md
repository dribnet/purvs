## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my final design. 3 of my friends are the theme for this project and I asked them to smile. I wanted to express the bright and positive aura that friends give us through this project. In three of my image, it shows 3 different background colours which give the bright and cheerful feeling. 

The shapes of the pixels are quite simple and they are only consist of lines and rectangles. Since my codel had to be seen smiling, I made up pixels with only small rectagles. and I tried to emphasise the model as much as possible in this project, and that's why I used yellow lines on the model's outline.

For the mask, I used a total of  4 colours. (black, white, two shades of grey) A black mask was used for the background, a bright grey mask for the model, and a white mask for the model. Actually, I didn’t make the code for the dark grey, that colour is just used to prevent any effect from another codes.

Combining photos with coding and see how it turns out was interesting. Overall, I really enjoyed to experiment how the code completely changed my deign. I’m happy with the final design.
