## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This try kind of fail, I still use the Images which I took from Shenzhen MOCAP. 

I really want to use the line to create out the position of the lights that I use noise and line to create the pattern. In the first input it looks fine, however going to second and third one it like a disaster.

Especially, the second image it simple looks like a brunch of the mess fringe lol

In this experiential, I think I will do sth connect with natural such as, light or water.
