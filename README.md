my letters are composed of four rectangles placed in different positions to create different shapes. lines are drawn between each rectangle, but not between the first and last. very simple idea, probably could use some more interesting design elements.

The eight parameters per letter:
	x(n): x coordinate of point in letter
	y(n): y coordinate of point in letter
