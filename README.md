## AQUATIC TEXT


I am current experimenting with my own shapes to create something abstract/different. In the process I have made in making this alphabet I have configured the arc to create an interesting shape the represents each letter, along side the line which also helps seperate each letter individually.

I have experimented with different styles and finally decided on how im going to approach my lettering in my alphabet. I have named my style 'Aquatic' after its blue style along with how the letters are shaped.

The parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the line relative to the origin
  * `offsety` : y offset of the line relative to the origin
  * `arcX` : x position of the arc
  * `arcY` : y position of the arc
  * `lineX` : y position of the line
  * `lineY` : y position of the arc
  * `arcW` : width of the arc
  * `arcH` : height of the arc
  * `arcS` : start point of the arc
  * `lineOX` : x position of origin point
  * `lineOY` : y position of origin point
