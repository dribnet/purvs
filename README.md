## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

For my design, I am aiming to use mostly white negative contrasted by a black triangle. I am trying to stick to only using an ellipse, rectangle, and a triangle which is proving to be rather difficult so I might have another shape at handin. 

 these are my parameters:
 
 [triangle position]
 
 triangleX 
 triangleY
 
 [sizing, width being the 2 bottom sides of the triangle and height being the top]
 
 triWidth
 triheight
 
 [triangle angle]
 
 triAng

[ellipse position]

ellipseX
ellipseY

[size]

ellipseSize

[rectangle position]

rectX
rectY

[size]

rectWidth
rectHeight
