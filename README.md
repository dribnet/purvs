## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

idea: i like the idea of my design being kinda ocean-inspired. I'll show this through the colour scheme and through having a few little waves accross the main boday of the letter

today I spent the whole class trying to figure out bezier curves and for loops. I have one that I kinda like but I ended up deciding to use a sin wave instead - I might even look into how to make it move. Curves have been a real challenge for me to figure out though
