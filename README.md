Isocale - a graphic font designed with the intention of mastering the use of triangles in pj5s as I have never used them before. My main inspiration for my letterforms came from triangles and the colour scheme I chose early on. These tones are some I have worked with before so I knew they were aesthetically pleasing. I liked the contrast these soft tones had with the angular shape of a triangle which made me think of the sounds of letters. Some are soft and some are hard. This then lead me to experiment with how different letters sound and how I could visually represent this through the use of three triangles. Therefore, some of the letters appear to look similar to the traditional english alphabet letterforms and some are a bit more abstract. I wanted the letters to display the energy the letters gave rather than be a super readable representation of the letters. My colour palette never changed because it is what drove my entire experimentation and idea behind my design. 

I think one of the best design decisions I made was my use of stroke as it created depth and extra detail with it being the same colour and my backgrounds. Since I wanted my font to be super graphic I did not want a lot of detail or small decoration I wanted it to be solid and very linear based. I called this font isoscale based on the different triangles I used, being isoceles and scalene. I am also happy with my decision to draw my letters inside of the red constant triangle rather than in and outside of it, I think it made the design far more cohesive and satisfying when interpolating. I am happy with my interpolation because it shows a softness with the occasion sharp motion depending on the letter which is what my font is all about. My favourite letters are H, N and V. 


Here are my parameters for each letter so far - each letter may have different set of paramaters but every letter or digit only has 12 parameters.
   "triX1": first x point of first triangle
   "triY1": first y point of first triangle
   "triX2": second x point of first triangle
   "triY2": second y point of first triangle
   "triX3": third x point of first triangle
   "triY3": third y point of first triangle


   "2triX1": first x point of second triangle
   "2triY1": first y point of second triangle
   "2triX2": second x point of second triangle
   "2triY2": second y point of second triangle
   "2triX3": third x point of second triangle
   "2triY3": third y point of second triangle

   "3triX1": first x point of third triangle
   "3triY1": first y point of third triangle
   "3triX2": second x point of third triangle
   "3triY2": second y point of third triangle
   "3triX3": third x point of third triangle
   "3triY3": third y point of third triangle
