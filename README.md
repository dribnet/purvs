## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Stress themed experiment.

The image of my computer came out looking much more aggressive than I intended (likely due to it being a screen rather than a window), so that means we get an experiment on a stress based theme because I kinda liked how it looked. Current potential stress sources: Work, the outside world, the online world, people. Maybe do one where the outside of the image is the stressful thing and a book or something is the calmer bit? The area that isn't the stressed bit is meant to be fairly soft, and the bit that is stressed is meant to sort of spill out into the background - I might have to figure out how to do layers to really make that work. Image 2 will also have to be changed to something else stressful.
