Updated Idea again.. 

Using fixed lines to represent the letters and arcs. After trying this idea out i found out that the interaction section of this assignment wouldnt work with how i coded these letters. So i am back to drawing board.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `lines` : array that represents what lines/arcs are shown. [top,topright,botright...]
  * `box#` : just determines the colour effect.
