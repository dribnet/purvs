## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Worked on looking at the interaction between the letters. Updated variable names to make them more clear. For the interpolate letters, all my maps were set at 0, 100. This map made the animation run really smooth, however, i changed a few of the maps to be slightly more jarring and make the animation look more visually interesting. Although this means the animation isnt as effortless with the maps as they were, I like the new effect more.

The ten parameters per letter:

- circDiam: the size of the circle
- CircleX: the x position of the circle
- CircleY: the y position of the circle 
- lineX: x position of the rectangle 
- lineY: y position of the rectangle 
- lineH: height of the rectangle 
- lineW: width of the rectangle 
- flipX: Arc x to swap numerical value with y
- flipY: Arc y to swap numerical value with x
- StrokeW: Changes the thickness of the line
