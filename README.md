PART 2: INFINITE ZOOMABLE SKETCH

Following on from my sketch in part 1, as well as my work in PS3, I have tried to use print10 to create an abstract view of a night time city block (think of the really grid like Manhatten).

I used stroke transparancy as well as a deep midnight blue to try to create the glow effect and overall night-time feel.

I tried to think about what our cities might look like in the future. For example, would they look and feel completely inorganic - a block within a block within a block.

 I've also tried to incorporate the way streets turn into these base block geometric elements when you zoom right in on something like google maps.
