The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

I have started making my letter form in the alphabet.js. I have the max amount of parameters so it takes a while to create each letter. I like the rules I have set out for myself but because there is quite a bit of possibility in what I can create it also makes it hard to make all my letters aesthetically pleasing.
I'm thinking about making my idea simpler but I'm also aware that I am running out of time.
