## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Tuesday 04 June.

This is not the final as of yet. I added some fill colour to the background triangles just to see what it looks like. It does bring out the greyscale images well but not sure about it meshing together with the final image. I still like, however, I might go back and experiment more with the code to get a final look that I am entirely happy with. 

In terms of experimenting with the code I will look at the colour, stroke and tiles to see what else I can implement.
