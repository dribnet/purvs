## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I wanted to play around with the colour, stroke and transparency. For this design I used purples and blues. I like the way the colours look together, epically when the two smaller circlers overlap.  I didn't change the stroke weight or transparency for this particular design. 


The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
