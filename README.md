## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

During today's class I mostly worked on the shape of my letters in alphabet.js. 

I changed the colour to something more pleasing and the size of the ellipses because I realised the letters were too small. 

I also had to add another 2 parameters because the letter 'K' was quite complicated to do with the parameters I already had.

Next I hope to finish the whole alphabet and numbers and then adjust accordingly to the brief. I also need to do the editor.js stuff that was shown in today's lecture too.
