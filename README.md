So, this is my final for project 2. I have named my font 'lined up'.  My typography is referencing a very simple and clean style. I wanted to make my type front to be executed with a very readable style to emphasize the practicality of my font. I referenced ideas of structured and stability with the idea that each of the letters has one dominant line, underlining this point with a much thicker line compared to the rest. As I put a few rules in place for my font it generated a very structured font face. Looking into the translation between the letters again is very clean and simple to help enforce the initial idea of a clean and sleek design.

My typeface is made up with 4 lines, the lines are placed on roughly 90 or 45 degrees, except some of the numbers move slightly away from this rule. The numbers were a bit more complex with the angles as I really wanted to create a slight distinction between numbers and letters. This was taken through with the sizes of each. The letters being smaller not filling the whole 100, 200 boxes whereas the numbers did. The size was also different as I focused on creating the lowercase alphabet as I felt it was more clean and suited my parameters.

Looking at things I would have refined further if I had more time, I would invest more time into iterating a slightly more complex structure, to not take away from the initial idea of clean and sleek but to more push it that much more. I would have also liked to create unique transition for each letter and number. 


The 8 parameters per letter are now:
  * ptx - X cord for 1st line point
  * pty - Y cord for 1st line point
  * ptx2 - X cord for 2nd line point
  * pty2 - Y cord for 2nd line point

  * ptx3 - X cord for 3rd line point
  * pty3 - Y cord for 3rd line point
  * ptx4 - X cord for 4th line point
  * pty4 - Y cord for 4th line point

  * ptx5 - X cord for 5th line point
  * pty5 - Y cord for 5th line point
  * ptx6 - X cord for 6th line point
  * pty6 - Y cord for 6th line point

  * ptx7 - X cord for 7th line point
  * pty7 - Y cord for 7th line point
  * ptx8 - X cord for 8th line point
  * pty8 - Y cord for 8th line point
