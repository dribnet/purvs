### 18 hours of static is not nothing.

This clock is just 18 hours of static played on repeat. Once the pattern is learned the user can learn identify what time it by just observing the static feedback. 
Disclaimer: This clock has an extremely steep learning curve, users may require a degree in science and communication to actually use as a functional clock.
Additional Disclaimer: This is just a test to see if the tutorial setup is working please ignore this ridiculousness.
