## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final Summary.
The design that was used was made to represent the theme people in nature. There were originally supposed to be 3 layers to a mask but that changed to 5 due to the clothes pattern not suiting the skin and hair on the people and I wanted the people to be more detailed to show the people aspect to the design. The people pixels are all ordered and neat to represent man made objects which normally they are symmetrical and planned while the nature pixels used are random and jumbled to show what nature is like. The thing I liked the most in my design was the clothes pixel, I thought it was the best design for the pixel because even though most of it is black it shows colour and tone the best out of all the pixels.
