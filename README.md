## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I have redesigned my space scene so that it has 3 layers and is less intense than my original spirals.

The first layer is a scene of stars that represent the different galaxies.

The second layer zooms into a single galaxy and incorporates the old spiral design but is now more intricate.

The third layers shows a more detailed version of the galaxy where the stars represent all the different suns in that galaxy.

To further refine my design I will fix the issue of the grid being obvious and cutting off the shapes and add in my animation.
