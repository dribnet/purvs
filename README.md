## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

This is my font animated when a letter is typed. 

The keyframes are shown above and it shows the certain changes among the parameters. The main elements include the ellipses and the kinetic rectangle.

I noticed that the default mapping complimented my typeface really well, as there are no noticeable jarring elements such as severe overlapping and misplacements.

The updated parameters are as follows:

	"size": 		Size of 1st ellipse
	"offsetx": 		X pos
	"offsety": 		Y pos
	"size2": 		Size of 2nd ellipse
	"offsetx2":		X pos
	"offsety2": 	Y pos
	"qua_x1_1": 	Quad 1st vertices x pos
	"qua_y1_1": 	Quad 1st vertices y pos
	"qua_x2_1": 	Quad 2nd vertices x pos
	"qua_y2_1": 	Quad 2nd vertices y pos
	"qua_x3_1": 	Quad 3rd vertices x pos
	"qua_y3_1": 	Quad 3rd vertices y pos
	"qua_x4_1": 	Quad 4th vertices x pos
	"qua_y4_1": 	Quad 4th vertices y pos
