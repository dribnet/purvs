 Currently my 10 variable per letter are:
  - vertX: X position of initial start of the line(anchor point)
  - vertY: Y position of initial start of the line(anchor point)
  - ctrlPx: X position of the control point for vertX
  - ctrlPy: Y position of the control point for vertY
  - vertX2: X position of the end point of the line(anchor point)
  - vertY2: Y position of the end point of the line(anchor point)
Added:
  - ctrlPx2: X position of the control point for the second curve
  - ctrlPy2: Y position of the control point for the second curve
  - vertX3: X position of the end point of the second curve(anchor point)
  - vertY3: Y position of the end point of the second curve(anchor point)

  Completed the alphabet part of this project, I've added "? / =" as I wasn't really sure what i'd do for the custom letters. 
  For the numbers since some of the numbers are similiar in shape to letters I decided to make them a bit smaller than the alphabet just to aid the viewer in distinguishing which is a letter and which is a number for instance 5 and S look similar.
