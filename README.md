(Note - For this iteration I have refactored a lot of the code to allow for a more
  dynamic usage of the shape generator. You can now get each layer of shapes to
  draw only in certain areas and in different colors. Through this I will use it
  to create a "sea" in my landscape by layering the pattern on top of itself.)

This program draws either a wallpaper, or a landscape.
You can press the spacebar to switch between the modes.
You can click on the canvas to generate a new wallpaper or landscape.

--Wallpaper--
The wallpaper uses simple rects and lines
to create a detailed pattern.

The color scheme is neon and bright,
taking inspiration from future japanese night lighting. The goal of this wallpaper
is to create an aesthetically pleasing composition using simple shapes to create
a complex pattern.

--Landscape--

TBD
