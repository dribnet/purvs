## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Each of my letters is composed with 12 circles. Each of the 12 circles is shadowed by another circle of different colour.

The 24 parameters per letter:
  * circle(#)x = x position of circle. x12
  * circle(#)y = y position of circle. x12
  * squareback = fixed.

Just updated the letters all individually, with help with slider. Decided to copy and paste all 24 parameters, and // out the dots that were not needed so that all dots were aligned and the alphabet was consistent. I now need to create the backboard of each letter/number to make the text look like my inspiration. I made the numbers also smaller as i wanted the 0 and 1 to differentiate from the letters.

Changed colours however, finding a way to make all letters readable. Maybe different colour letters per space - however not sure if that is possible.
