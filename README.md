(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters consist of 4 cresents made up of 2 arcs each, all based at the center and rotating outward from there. None of the postions are fixed and they all move with the letter and are postioned so they dont overlap most of the time.

The eight parameters per letter:
  * `rot1`: Controls rotation of Arc1
  * `rot2`: Controls rotation of Arc2
  * `rot3`: Controls rotation of Arc3
  * `rot4`: Controls rotation of Arc4
  * `offset1`: Controls the X offset of Arc1
  * `offset2`: Controls the X offset of Arc2
  * `offset3`: Controls the X offset of Arc3
  * `offset4`: Controls the X offset of Arc4
