## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

In this project, I have taken the monsters I made in PS1 a step further and applied slightly different details to create a new and more slightly detailed monster with a less blocky feel, but I still wanted this to be a bit cartoon styled.

I have incorporated elements from the devil and applied a refined colour scheme to reflect this. To push this idea further, I have used photos of well known dictators as my input for the code to map these devil masks to. The idea is to show these dictators as devils/monsters but also to make them look silly, as they are very serious characters.

This idea of making them look silly has led me to exaggerate elements, such as the hair, eye size and mouth size. The nose size can also be adjusted, as well as hair colour, moustache, eye direction, horn length and horn colour.

In training the code, I have tried to keep the aspects relative to the photos, but added characteristics, such as the horn length/colour are based roughly off the age of the person in the photo, and moustache depends on whether it is a man or woman and the size of the mouth is based on how open the person mouth is, so a big smile means a big mouth.
