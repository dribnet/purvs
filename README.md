### My Version of Maedaâ€™s 12 clocks (Number 4)


This is a recreation of clock four.

I made some changes when I recreated the clock. I found that the overlapping and partly transparent numbers were difficult to read so I didn't make mine overlap and made them solid colours.

The numbers on my clock are larger than the numbers on the original to make it easier to read.
 
I also did not include the seconds in my clock so it was simpler to recreate.

### Moon Clock

The idea behind this clock is the cycles of the moon.
The amount of the moon showing is related to the time.
As the day progresses less of the moon is shown. So the full moon is 12:00am and no moon is 12:00pm.

This was my inspiration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase
