I have continued developing my code to express more letters of the alphabet. I have changed a few of the parameters as they weren't doing exactly as I was intending. However, now I have run into a new problem as the small rectangles are now moving with the larger rectangles. I have run out of time today so will have to find a fix for this next time.


I now have eight parameters and they are:

  * `size` : The length of the second wide rectangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the thin rectangles (having issues with this)
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the first thick rectangle
  * `offset3x` : x offset of the second thick rectangle
  * `offsety` : y offset of the first thin rectangle
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the second thin rectangle
  * `offset3y` : y offset of the third thin rectangle
   * `offset3y` : y offset of the second thick rectangle

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
