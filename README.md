## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Carbon Emissions

For my final project I wanted to try and fulfill the criteria of the project which engages the community/viewer. I was really stuck with what to do for quite a while until I stumbled across a map that showed carbon emissions by country. I was unsure about how to approach this data or how to display it. Then I stumbled upon another great find which was the Atlantis Map projection, this map projection allowed me to display the globe in portrait. I slightly adjusted this projection to fit in New Zealand because in the default version NZ is cut in half. Link to map can be found here https://www.mapthematics.com/ProjectionsList.php?Projection=53. 

With this new found information I set out to display the world with a map of CO2 emissions per capita, found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita, naming and shaming the worst offenders by mapping the data to size and lightness of the cubes, I decided on the light purple tone as it was what I pictured how CO2 would look, even though it is mostly a colorless gas. After I put together this render I was unsure of where to go for the next two images. I thought about using the same map projection and displaying more data related to global warming / the environment but I felt like it was cheating by using the same code and image. 

I decided on taking some pictures of traffic to engage the viewer so that they were more aware of the impact one person can have I drew a mask of smoke and using the cubes I drew a "visible" smoke from the exhaust of the vehicles. I completed this but was visually boring to me. I got some feedback and decided to introduce some noise to get a better visual representation of smoke. I liked the final output of this and decided to use it for my final hand-in. I was very happy in the end with the outcome of my project despite many hiccups along the way both creatively and technically. I would like to explore noise a lot more as I think many cool visuals could be created from this effect.
