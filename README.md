## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Today I knocked out the letters A through to L but may end up changing them  later on if I become happy with them, I added in the code required to use an arc in my writing and may eventully swap the ellipse to either a square or a triangle later on to add a different view



The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  'start' : First angle for my arc
  'stop' : Second angle for my arc
