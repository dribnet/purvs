<<<<<<< HEAD
I did a bit of experimentation on my code today and have created a parametric font which I am quite pleased with the look of, composed of six parameters.
I may have to end up adjusting some of these parameters when it comes to creating more complex letters, or find a way to stylize the letters in a way that suits my paramaters.

The six parameters per letter:
  * `size` : the size of the thin rectangles.
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the first thick rectangle
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the second thick rectangle
  * `offsety` : y offset of the first thin rectangle
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the second thin rectangle
  * `offset3y` : y offset of the third thin rectangle

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
