(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two round lines and two circles. All me lines and circles are not fixed, so they can have much different combinations.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
