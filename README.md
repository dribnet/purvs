## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2


Introducing three triangles and refining the letters to be cohesive. So far I am happy with my A, E, F, G, L, O, U, 2, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9. I now need to get the other letters to match the aesthetics of these. 



Here are my parameters for each letter so far
   "triX1": first x point of first triangle
   "triY1": first y point of first triangle
   "triX2": second x point of first triangle
   "triY2": second y point of first triangle
   "triX3": third x point of first triangle
   "triY3": third y point of first triangle


   "2triX1": first x point of second triangle
   "2triY1": first y point of second triangle
   "2triX2": second x point of second triangle
   "2triY2": second y point of second triangle
   "2triX3": third x point of second triangle
   "2triY3": third y point of second triangle

   "3triX1": first x point of third triangle
   "3triY1": first y point of third triangle
   "3triX2": second x point of third triangle
   "3triY2": second y point of third triangle
   "3triX3": third x point of third triangle
   "3triY3": third y point of third triangle
