### Episode 04 Like clockwork

Still sticking to the main idea of concept three but some changes will be made 
in order to keep the idea witihn the clock.

In this cases i still need to find a way to change the background depnding on the time, as well as change the actuall digital time's colour too copensate for the alternatives of colour, due to the black background.

i have yet to figure this out i hope i can do so in the following days.
as such there will be alot of changes to how this clock will go through.

a few of the planning sections are show above
