## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

  idea 1: draw the design out of circles with varying opacities so it has a sorta ghost-like effect. I could use true/false features to make cloudy effects in the back. The design I did in class today is like a super basic verison of what I eventually want to do.

 I added arcs to my letters to help make it look more like the actual letters. At first I was struggling because I couldn't figure out how to get it down to 12 variables from 14, but then I realized that I could remove the opacity variable and just set the size to 0 if I wanted things to disappear. I'll just have to accept that everything will be the same opacity all the time. I also changed the "cutouts" from white to purple, orange, and yellow to contrast with the green. I'm not sure how I feel about it - I think it looks cool but I did like the ghosty effect I got from the white. I'll worry about that later one though when I've drawn the whole alphabet.

 I started playing around with pinks and blues like I planned to in the last assignment
