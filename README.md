Today, I worked on creating my animation between the letters. I now need to create the rest of my alphabet but I'm finding the animation helpful as it is showing me what transition between letters looks better.

The parameters per letter:

  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `offset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one

  *	`StrokeW` : Weight of the stroke
  *	`opacity` : Colour opacity

  * `offsetx2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offset2x2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset2y2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `offset3x2` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `offset3y2` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one
