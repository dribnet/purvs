(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

So far I've exhausted my parameters and use all 20. They are the following

The three parameters per letter:
  * "posx" : X position of the rectangles
  * "posy" : Y position of the rectangles
  *	"pos2x" : X position of the smaller triangle
  * "pos2y" : Y position of the smaller triangle
  *	"pos3x" : X position of the larger triangle
  * "pos3y" : Y position of the larger triangle
  * "pos4y" : X position of both arcs
  *	"pos4y" : Y position of both arcs
  * "arcS": Start of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arcE": End of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arc2S" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  * "arc2E" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  *	"recA" : X-coordinate/size of both rectangles
  *	"recB" : Y-coordinate/size of both rectangles
  *	"triX2": first X-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2": first Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2A" : second Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2A" : second X-coordinate of each triangle
  * "triY2B" : third Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2B" : third X-coordinate of each triangle

  Both the alphabet and the numbers are done at this point. I wish I would have used the parameters more efficiently, in order for me to add more shapes and texture to my current primitives. My initial plans included hatchings, dots, iines etc. embedded inside the current primitives. But I think for now I'll focus on creating a harmonic color scheme/palette.
