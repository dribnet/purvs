## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I experimented with using lines to get a sketchy effect and changed the i value from 2000 to 4500. I quite like how it looks, I'm trying to find a balance between detail and gentle abstract. I may need to bump up the warmness to make the colours really pop!
I've taken an image from a recent visit to the Auckland Botanical Gardens, this is because I enjoy visiting this place and I love nature.

I found the code quite easy to navigate and understand.
