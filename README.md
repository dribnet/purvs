## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

This project has definitely been my favorite creative coding assignment so far, from first and second year. This was really the first project where my idea came to me straight away and it became a little passion project. My alphabet is flamboyant, quirky and very out there. I have transformed the traditional simple rainbow design into an array of energetic abstract designs, while still following the rainbow rulebook - multi-coloured, multiple rays, and the semi-circle rainbow shape. Each one is unique and captivating to observe. My alphabet follows a very laid back system, like the traditional Latin alphabet many letters possess similar qualities in appearance, such as M & N, I & J, E & F. But then there are letters that deem a more powerful and substantial form, these being H, K, U, G, O, Q, D. While some of my letters have resulted in following similar forms to their latin siblings such as my version of the letter C, it too follows a curved ‘C’ shape, you will then also look at my version for other letters like X and see not a single similarity. This is part of the fun and surprise that comes with my alphabet design. I hope that this is exciting and it’s seen as a positive that my alphabet is very different to the traditional Latin form.

I had a point of real worry once I had created my initial sketch.js of the simple rainbow design (that is now A), I had drawn the rays of my rainbow in a for loop, instead of drawing each ray individually. I tried this individually initially but struggled to get each line evenly spaced, evenly lengthed and at the correct rotation. The for loop ensured precision and perfect proportion. But when it came to begin to create my parameters, and interpolate each letter to make them different I worried that I would not be able to carry out my plan as my code looked very limited and I assumed the for loop would restrict me from changing each letter. Through trusting the process that I had been through, I played around with testing different variables as parameters to see what I could do. My idea sky rocketed into something I never first imagined it could be. While I thought my idea was out there and spontaneous, it was nothing compared to what it ended up becoming. My plan was just to change the way the rays were positioned or rotated for each letter. Having them pointing out to the side, all together, pointing outward from a narrow beginning, but I never considered changing the thickness, making them spin, cross over one another, form a wheel-shape, a fan-shape, or to look nothing like a traditional rainbow. This has really shown me to just go with the process, each step and detour brings you to a more interesting outcome, things you may perceive to be mistakes could end up being what really transforms your project into something awesome.

The biggest obstacle throughout this Parametric Alphabet journey was the first part of creating the rainbow shape and establishing them all correctly positioned in the alphabet.js. I am still learning to hurdle over little code mistakes that come with great detriment, such as not using a push(); pop();. Once I fixed the wacky positioning of the rainbows in my alphabet.js, the rest of this process was exciting. 

I am also proud to admit that I fixed my thumbnail size issue for this project! In Project One, all of my thumbnail.png commits were way too big for their frame which was messy and did not look very appealing in the purview.json. But with this project I have taken my time to ensure all my commits are done correctly. 

Parameters:
posx = X position of each letter
posy = Y position of each letter
linex1 = X-Coordinate of the first point
linex2 = Y-Coordinate of the first point
liney1 = X-Coordinate of the second point
liney2 = Y-Coordinate of the second point
numRaysVal = Pushes the rays all together or moves them further apart
numRaysVal2 =  Moves rays around, rotates them differently 
rotateVal = Determines how far apart rays are from one another, rotates them further 
rangeVal = Determines the range that the rays are rotating; around the rainbow
rayAmount = Determines the amount of lines drawn that make up the rays
strokeVal = Determines the stroke of each line that make up the rays 
arcStroke = Determines the stroke of the arcs that make up the rainbow
