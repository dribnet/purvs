### Clock-'Diary of a seed'
My final work is about a 'seed' story which happened in a crystal ball. 
I choose this idea because of most of time when people talk about time they will be all really worried and anxious, so I give up my first concept about create a time-keeper or the real clock, for instead of them I create a kind of toy which can make people feel relaxed and peaceful when they look them.
The seed is like a cartoon character and its eyes folowed millis, the rain also follow millis and the bud of seed grow up for each second.
I use the flower to express minutes and hours, flower will bloom in 60 minutes and the color change from red to yellow in 24 hours.
