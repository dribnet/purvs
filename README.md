## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

7/5 - My initial idea was to use colour theory in some way to represent the letters. I wanted to use contrasting colours to represent the progression of- the more contrasted a square, the further away from the middle of the alphabet (a square that is half blue, half orange is likely to be an a or a z). I then planned on making everything greyscale, as the contrast between black and white would come across better than other colours. However, this idea wasn't  readable (it was really hard to tell the diffrence between A and B, as the change wasn't obvious enough). So I started thinking about other representations of black and white contrast that I really liked, and I remembered the symbols of the alien heptapods from Dennis Villenueve's 'Arrival' (https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acXGjI8_53DZdz8SNugbVlR8qW8=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7469305/ArrivalInk.png). Not only do these symbols contrast really well, but also are an amazing, original representation of a language that I can draw inspiration from. 
Going off of this idea, I created a grey rectangle that (like my original b+w idea) has a white fill that decreases height the further along the alphabet a character is. Over this rectangle, I have two black arcs that, when combined, will show the letter. This means drawing letters that consist of two arcs. I'm using two arcs, as there are two heptapods drawing symbols in the movie, and because it's easier to draw a letter with 2 arcs rather than 1. 
From here, I want to make the ends of the arcs less rounded (I really dont like the rounded ends). I also want to develop on the thin/thick line weights shown in the heptapods symbols. My plan with this is to create a full circle with a thin line weight, and then use a thick line weight to draw the arc. When the two thick lineweight arcs are combined, they will form the letter.

10/5 - I've jsut tried copying over my code from sketch to draw letters and I'm having some issues, it seems like draw letters isn't getting any data from letters? I don't really know, I'm gonna post on the slack to see if anyone can help.


The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
