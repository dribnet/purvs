Each of my letters is composed with one Half circle and one Triangle. 
1) The size of circle is fixed, but the start point and the end point of the first circle is controlled by two parameters. 
2) Three point of the triangle is controlled by six parameters.

The eight parameters per letter:
  * `arcS` : angle to start the arc, specified in radians
  * `arcE` : angle to stop the arc, specified in radians
  * `movetriX1` : X1 offset of the triangle relative to the posX
  * `triX1toX2` : X2 offset of the triangle relative to the posX
  * `triX1toX3` : X3 offset of the triangle relative to the posX
  * `movetriY1` : Y1 offset of the triangle relative to the posY
  * `triY1toY2` : Y2 offset of the triangle relative to the posY
  * `triY1toY3` : Y3 offset of the triangle relative to the posY
