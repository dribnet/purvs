## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

At this point i am fairly happy with the typeface. Small adjustments can be made. I want to experiment with trying to realise some other ideas i have had to add to my design.

This commit attempted to add this idea of adding various custom shapes using the vertices of my original shape. the idea behind it is to have different colour values that could give the illusion of depth to the shapes. Although I am really unhappy with how messy the outcome is so i'm not going ahead with it. I think i may have been able to make this if I had built my code around the idea from the begginning.
