## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel



I changed the 3rd image to another image of Kerosine creek to keep the green theme going across all three images. I will work on polishing the masks to emphasise certain areas. I like the white area of the third photo as the stars create a water splashing effect. I'm not sure if this is too abstract or not but I would like to make it look more realistic. I tried changing the numbers and size of lines but this was the best result.
