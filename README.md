My theme for my final code is boundless, i want to show different images of areas with large mountains or areas that have one large feature within the image for example mountains seas or rocks. for all the images i used a mixture of areas, the first one is from Taupo NZ, the second is also from Taupo and the last one is from Wellington. the reason i chose this as my theme is that i really enjoy taking photos of the environment and landscapes because they can just look spectacular if taken correctly. My code is mostly made up of squares and i made it so that the colour really pops out as the same from each image to make the mask items really stand out from the image.
