Update 4: Today I have been working on my animation between letters, I have found this really helpful is creating some variation between letters in my code, I also like how the opacity spits in at the end, I like it a lot as for some letters there is no variation and others there is a lot so will create a different experience between letters. I am now just working on making the letters appear more like they would in a regular font so switching the I and J height as the J curves under so should be placed lower

Update 3: I needed to do some cleaning up of my code. All of my paremeters are now labelled correctly and making sure I'm commenting where I need to and that its too too confusing for me

Update 2: I am fixing up some of my letters, adding the final flare to them. I have also done a few swapping of colours as I have down this for variation between I and J and N and Z but they look too simiular to the ones next to it. I also find it very satisfing watching the animation to figure out what works well and what doesn't

Today, The editor has since been fixed is very helpful in making my design a little more quirky, I have also added some letters into my exbition. I defenity want to fix my G,2,5 as they work but look similar N,S,Z but that makes sense as they outline the shape of the movement more. I will also play around with my animation cause I think I could have some sharp movements for my red as it doesn't use a opacity which softens it up

The parameters per letter:

  * `redoffsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `redoffset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `redoffset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `redoffset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `redoffset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one

  *	`opacity` : Colour opacity

  * `yellowoffsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `yellowoffsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `yellowoffset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `yellowoffset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the second one
  * `yellowoffset3x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the third one
  * `yellowoffset3y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the third one
