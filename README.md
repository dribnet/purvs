This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 
At this stage I have been planning and creating the base code from which I will build my faces, which is why nothing exciting is happening in the images yet. I want to create three drastically different drawing styles. To help me keep everything clear and organised I am putting the faces and sliders into objects. They will keep track of their own dimensions, and be drawn onto their own graphics objects, which are then returned to the main sketch. Passing around all the slider values was getting silly, so I placed them inside an object. This object is passed to a face object, and not only returns the value required, but scales it as required as well.

I want the first face to be very simple, exploring what can be done with mostly basic shapes. At first I thought a monster or a robot, but I wanted something a little more whimsical, and perhaps less intuitive; I have chosen a ragdoll. The main theme I want to play with within my paramaters is changing the mood and style of the face. To do this I intend to have the various parameters transition between a cute childish ragdoll, and a creepy, Coraline-inspired ragdoll.

For my second face I want to play with the idea of abstraction and art. What if the flowers blooming on her cheecks were actual flowers, and what if there were real stars in her eyes?

I don't know yet what I am going to do for the third face.
