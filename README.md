## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

This version has the parachuters rotating without being cut off by the grid. I still want to play around with the point of rotate. I am also experimenting with making the clouds repeat instead of disappearing after reaching their boundaries. At the moment, it jumps when it resets but I will change the values to make it smooth.

I have made the speed slow and I think that the rotation matches the speed nicely.
