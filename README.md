Starting work on my landscape I have decided to explore a spacescape. The number of stars that forms the background can be varied from a lot of stars, to very little. The layout of the stars is determined by a nested for loop, with random variation in placement to create an organice feel. The opacity of the stars is alos generated randomly to create a more realistic backdrop.

The foreground is going to be made up of planets with varied size and colour.
