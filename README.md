I've iterated the sample code to have a new colorway and different sizing for the ellipses.

I intend to make linear fonts and perhaps a bold font with both circular and rectilinear elements.

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
