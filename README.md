## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

FLIPPY INTERPOLATION
In an earlier version of my font I wasn't paying attention to using each point in the parameters consistently, so I ended up with an animation that has the triangles flip and mirror a bit awkwardly during the interpolation.
You'll see in my final commit that the interpolation between the animations is smoother, more purposeful with it's loose Illustrator idea, and doesn't have the triangles cross over one another. I included this commit as I wanted to show off this style of interpolation because it was a route I considered sticking with, but ultimately moved on from it due to it looking too rushed and haphazardous.
I hope you enjoy. Christopher.
