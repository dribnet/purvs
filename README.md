## PS1B MDDN 342 2017 Title

This README explains the three different paramaterized faces for part2. 

In my case, in each of my faces I use 3 sliders. For the first face I used my previous solution but added controls for the tilt, mouth openess, and number of eyes.

In the second version I was mostly thinking about eyes and hair. For the eyes, there is a true/false variable which determines if the face is blinking as well as a continuous variable for shifting the eye left and right. The hair ranges from stubble to bushy.

In the third face I tried out a darker robot idea. This robot is always staring right at you and might have a wide or narrow head. His middle eye is a lazy eye.
