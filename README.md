## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I've played around with the "rain effect" on my slinky from pheobes tutorial. I really like the results on the slinky, it shows really cool transition into the background of the object. I want to move onto trying the crosshatch effect, I had a play around with making the lines horizontal but it didnt complement my design at all. I also increased the density so there was less background void. Im going to continue experimenting and try to find a design that suits one of my images tonight. I want to then apply it to the other images and then see if it complements them aswell.
