Alphabet Finalized

So I did add that other parameter and it gave me so much more freedom. But I think I was right in thinking it isnt the most legiable font. However I think my change in colour has helped to alliviate this issue as it makes everything darker and easier to view agaisnt the background. Some of the letters are more clear than others but I think I have worked within the constrainst well to deliver a good looking product. Something I primarily focussed on was the creation of a coherent font, in terms of all the letters looking as if they belong in the same family. Thus I am happy with the results. I am interested to see how it will work with the transitions though.
