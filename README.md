## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

As of right now I do not know what kind of image I will go for. I believe I may go for something like landscapes and city skylines or even portraits.
Currently I have 3 images from my year one DSDN144 photographics project 2 which looked at light. My thought process for this project was to show big name companies products in a type of evil light.
