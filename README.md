## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

In the exhibition, the animation of my words transformation is smooth and looks very 3D surprisingly. But the position of some letters are weird and not in the right position.

Next step:
- Reposition and adjust some alphabets.
- Develop on colour template for my alphabet.
- Research on exhitbition letter choices.
- Reduce the parameters use.

The parameters per letter:
  * `x1` : x offset of the first cube 
  * `y1` : y offset of the first cube 

  * `x2` : x offset of the second cube relative to the first one
  * `y2` : y offset of the second cube relative to the first one

  * `x3` : x offset of the third cube
  * `y3` : y offset of the third cube 

  * `x4` : x offset of the fourth cube
  * `y4` : y offset of the fourth cube 

  * `x5` : x offset of the fifth cube
  * `y5` : y offset of the fifth cube 

  * `x6` : x offset of the sixth cube
  * `y6` : y offset of the sixth cube 

  * `x7` : x offset of the seventh cube
  * `y7` : y offset of the seventh cube 

  * `x8` : x offset of the eighth cube
  * `y8` : y offset of the eighth cube
