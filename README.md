Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 12 parameters.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

I have completed the parameters for my alphabet so am now looking into different styles and what style will be used for my final alphabet.

 - Style Three
 	- Solid Colour/No Overlay

 	This style aims to resemble a more ink based medium, with each layer being solid black with no transperancy.

 	This allows for each letter to appear as a block form rather than a form made of two layers overlapping.
