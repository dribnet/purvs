My design was inspired by Chinese Zodiac Clock.
Each of the animals symbolized specific time.
The total order is Rat, OX, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig.
Rat is signified 12 and 24 and so on.
I draw the animal's features based on their ears. 
Mostly of my code is about rotate and translate, sometime is hard to figure out where is the X, Y.
When the alarm is on, I create a halo in the center of the canvas also it is the hours area.
I choose the main colors are Black, White, Gold and some Gray. It makes the clock look old-fashion.
Because it only has twelve animals, when the time past 12pm, the hours color will change to gray. That means the time already past a half day.
I didn't follow my idea for some point, I'm thinking make the hours rotate as a cycle, but I make it jump up and jump back, it's more lively for show my zodiac clock.
