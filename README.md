## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

I added the interpolate function and tested it in the interaction.html. I also added the sliders with the editor.js. I only added the editor.js just to test it out, however, it is not necessary for my alphabet. They both work fine though.

I have come up with a font name!! "Medieval" because when I look at it I think swords or knives and vikings.

I also adjusted my stroke and size of my letters so that they allow the words in exhibition.html to be legible. In saying that I have added the interaction and looked at the exhibition code and changed the SwapWords- Medieval, Creative and ETC12345.

I feel as though I have little details to fix from now on. I don;t want to make drastic changes as that is just not necessary. I think my alphabet functions well and is legible enough. I will continue to try develop my idea if needed, tweak it abit and then hopefully be able to hand it in next Tuesday.
