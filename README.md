## Powers of 10 PRINT

### Part 1

1. Groupings of small ellipses not unlike the stars in my PS3 atop of a green/dark blue background
2. Mountain shapes become apparent instead of the green/dark blue background
3. Ellipses change to become the crystal-like columns in my PS3
4. Increased detail on the columns and full zoom on the mountain shapes (should take up entirety of screen)

### Part 2

I've adjusted the example_fence.js code to fit my stars design for the first zoom level.
Initially I struggled with understanding how the design would be translated to pixel space, but talking to Tom helped me figure out how I could get my design to work.
I think I will fiddle around with how many 'stars' are drawn initially, and how they are grouped, as I think it would work better in clusters. But for now, I am happy with the progress.
