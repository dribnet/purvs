Polygon Alphabet
=======

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have made my letter forms have a polygon shape to them. The have over 4 sides on most of the shapes with only 4 points in the vertex that are moveable while the the tops of the shapes or 2 of the vertex points could not be moved which gave me a limitation on what I could and couldn't do with the shapes. I really like this letter form because It was a challenge and when you look at the letters it is still clear on what the letters are which still makes the alphabet readable.
This included updating the parameters to having only 8 points of movement instead of 18, which is moving the vertex points on the x and y axis for 4 points. I found that it was going to be difficult and long trying to move 18 points so I limited myself to only be able to move 8 things. I still kept my origional idea in a way where the shapes are still polygons, but in this way they can are simpler and less complex.

The eight parameters per letter are now:
  * `offset1x` : x offset of the horizontal movement of one of the vertex points.
  * `offset1y` : y offset of the vertical movement of one of the vertex points.
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the horizontal movement of one of the vertex points.
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the vertical movement of one of the vertex points.
  * `offset3x` : x offset of the horizontal movement of one of the vertex points.
  * `offset3y` : y offset of the vertical movement of one of the vertex points.
  * `offset4x` : x offset of the horizontal movement of one of the vertex points.
  * `offset4y` : y offset of the vertical movement of one of the vertex points.

These parameters are all nessasary to be able to move the letters into readable forms, while if there were 10 parameters the shapse would have a nicer more readable form, but I wanted there to be a challenege. Next step is animation.
