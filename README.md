## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

STRUCTURING AND LAYERING MY FILTER

Today I further developed the masks for all my photos. I ended up layering my code so that I could cover up any parts that bleed out of there masks. In my last commit, I was using the pixels in a grid and the pointillism code however in order to have my filters to looked more structured I decided to just use the pixels in a grid formation. This overall looks a lot cleaner and works with all 3 photos. Next, I want to add in some more detail that relates to my model feeling upset and angry maybe coding an upset face, this is something I will experiment with next.
