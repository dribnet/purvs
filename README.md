Today I nearly finish my alphabet, but I still have some nice ideas want to realise. I plan to set a random colour of the inside of Oreas so that the colours will change randomly. For example, using pink to present shrawberry flavor and brown with chocolate flavor. Also I want to create more on the number "0" because so far it is the same with letter "O", which is not so satisfying.

The parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
