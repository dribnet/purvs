## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've got my masks set up, I may eventually do more with layers but I've got the basic concept down so it emphasizes the hand (or foot) in each shot. I also made the background red just to do something fun. I Like having the background be an odd color, it's kind of like when you do an oil painting and you start with a really different base color. I definitely want to have red as the predominant color in the piece but I'm not sure if I want to do that by keeping the background red and emphasizing another shade or if I want to emphasize the red in the pixels and make the background some other color.
