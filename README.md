Lego Faces

I have begun to add to the face drawing code, adding additional sliders to allow for more variation, whether all these direct controls stay in the final design is unclear, but for now it allows me to explore different values directly rather than randomly. 

The eyes are in a good state, with a large level of variation and control. Showing a broad range of emotions, however aesthetics may change as well as value range refinement. 

The mouth has a primitive version working at the moment, with the basic range of emotions being available, I will look into different methods of integrating more unique shapes.

So far so good.
