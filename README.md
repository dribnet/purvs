## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

I tested out some random code by just playing around and messing with some things and I ended up with this hairy triangle stuff. It looks really interesting and I think it would be nice to see it experimented further however I'm not sure if this is too abstract. I want the hairs to be denser and longer, however it with the triangles I want some on the top along with squares so that you can see still see the flower. I'm not too sure about this but I think it would be interesting to test it out some more.
