## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2




I started off working on sketch.js to get the used to the way this Assignment works. It took me a while to understand the way this code works, but it started to make more sense after I added some variables. Once I had a better idea of what I was doing I started working on the alphabet. I chose to use triangles as I thought I would be able to manipulate different forms more easily. I also used a lot of ellipses for assignment 1 and thought this would be a good change. I chose different shades of turquoise for my colours, but I might change the opacity later on once all letters/numbers are finished and I can see it all clearly. While I was adding on letters, a few new ideas came to my mind, but I will edit them once I actually get all the letters done.

 Update 2.
 I finished the alphabet and added some shapes to letters that only had 2 triangles. My next step is to do the numbers. Once that is done I will play around with stroke and opacity.

Update 3.
I really like the way the animation turned out. Especially A to V as they are the same, but opposite directions. I also really like X and W.

Update 4.
I finalised my exhibition page and chose the words freezing, glaciers and diamonds. I thought the colours gave the font a cold theme. The triangles reminded me of ice and crystals which is why I chose glacier and diamond. Those words also use the letters I like the most (such as NDS) and show a good range of letters.

I changed the background colour a few times and settled for a dark blue. I also liked black because of the contrast, but I thought a dark blue would link back to the "cold" theme while still contrasting the colours.

I polished some letters and luckily realised my letter S was backwards. I ended up using the backwards S as the number 2 and flipped the S the right way.

Update 5

I stuck to the same idea throughout the project, meaning my gits are relatively similar. However, I did change a few things throughout the process such as the colours. I also added a triangle to letters that only had 2 triangles in order to keep it more consistent. This included letter A which did not "need" the third triangle to look like an A. Some letters, such as X, are only made up of 2 triangles as I did not think they needed the 3rd triangle. I could have added a 3rd triangle to the letter C, but I thought if very few characters used 2 triangles they would look out of place.

My least favourite character is number 5, although it looks like a 5 and looks better than it originally did. I thought about it for a long time and could not think of another way to draw it which was slightly frustrating.

I created the letters in order from A to Z, to ensure each letters were different colour wise. In other words, I wanted the 3 colours to be spread out evenly. Triangle 1 is the darkest, Triangle 2 is in between and Triangle 3 is the lightest. I did not end up adding a stroke as I really didn't like the look of it.

Below are the 18 parameters used. Each correspond to a point for each triangle. As triangles have 3 points, they have 3 x variables and 3 y variables. In the beginning, I was working with 2 triangles, which can be seem in my sketch hmtl. However, when I started working on the full alphabet, I realised I could do a lot more with 3.

Overall, I am happy with my final alphabet. Although, I started this assignment relatively late, which caused a lot of stress, I am happy with the outcome.
