## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I got an idea to add some graphics that aren't in the photos using the masks from seeing the previous students work shown in class. I decided to create patterns of repeating drawings based on the theme on top of the main dark area in each photo. For the first photo of the shelter in New Zealand, I made a koru pattern to represent New Zealand art. For the second photo of the torii gate in Japan, I made a wave pattern inspired by the great wave which is a famous Japanese artwork and also ties into the water in the photo. For the third photo of things I bought from Japan, I made a globe pattern which shows both New Zealand and Japan to represent being globally connected.

I wanted the effect of these graphics to look like the paint had been scratched away. I did this with tiny randomly placed circles filled with the colour of the background. I like how this clearly shows the shape of the pattern and still looking hand made. I didn't change the opacity of the fill, but the circles are all different opacities. I'm not sure why this happened but I like that it has variation. Because of this I also added random variation to the size of the circles as well. I tried both lines and circles and I decided the circles show the shape of all the graphics better than the lines but I still might change this as it doesn't really look like a scratched line. I also removed the background colour manipulation as I decided that it didn't add much to the effect I'm going for.
