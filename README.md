Chose to refine the 1920's cartoon / street art character.

Introduced two additional styles for the characters "nose". This provides more variety whilst retainging a cohesive feel. Added a dog and bird style.

Added new value parameters, including; pupil size, eyelid height, eyebrow height, teeth value, and face type.
