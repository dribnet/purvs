## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Iterating

In iterating my design I've started experiementing with multiple masks, one to outline the subject of the photo and another to identify the face of my subject. Trying this in a way to further distort and abstract the face of my subject, which is our main identifier when looking at other humans. At first I wanted to create larger ellipses for the faces so that it'd be less defined than the rest of the render, however I found that the way they were layered verticially made the resolution difference not that noticeable. After trying unsuccessfully to fix this issue by creating a seperate element spacing for my second mask, I decided to go more in line with the background,  smaller shapes with white space between them. This is interesting because it creates a somewhat transparent effect. Still want to develop this further.
