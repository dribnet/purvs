Today I finally turned my pen sketch into a full p5 sketch using parameters. This took quiet a lot of time because my letters are slanted and I am using quads so have to code every point of the shapes. At the moment i have over 20 parameters so my next step is to reduce it down to 20. I only realised this after completing it so i will have to work hard to not compromise the design while changing the way my shapes are layered. I thinking about swapping some of the quads out for triangles or rectangles so that less parameters are used.

I was also going to add more details to the letters but the parameter limit makes that impossible without a simpler font.

Today I redesigned my alphabet so that it complied with the 20 parameter limit. In order to do this I had to use two triangles and two rectangles rather than 4 quads. I also had to take the slant off of the letters because it needed consistency and I couldn't accomplish slanted cut outs using rectangles.

After redesigning it on paper I applied to my files and started crafting the letters. I am having trouble getting the triangles to appear in the alphabet at the moment so I have been focusing on the squares for now. This allows me to lay down the basic shapes in the editor so when I figure out the triangles I know where to put them.
