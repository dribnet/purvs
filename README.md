## Morse Code Alphabets

After some help with friends, I've managed to set up my parameters and have finally figured out what each of them control. Right now, I have an A and I will be continuing on making the rest of my alphabets. I've also deleted the default code and restarted from sctrach which made things a lot clearer. 


The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
