I chose to refine the 1920s style cartoon design. I felt this presented the most refined and unique style, whilst providing sufficient capacity for experimentation with parametric design in conveying distinct emotional states.

In the randomised set I introduced two new face styles for the character. This was to increase variety in the design and allude more strongly to my artist precedents.

I added a bird design and a dog design. These both provided new form to the style that helped break up the similar looking designs.

I also opted for a new mouth design that I felt again more strongly suited the style and tone I was trying to convey. The changing number of teeth offered a further range of form and emotion.

A further change I added was the inclusion of eyelids. This is largely one of the most significant inclusions in providing more emotional states in the design.

I now felt that the degree of variety in form and emotion was sufficient in producing a successful output. My next task would be to look at potential iterations with colour and also distribution of certain variables.
