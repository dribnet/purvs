## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

i tried making the background pixel length look really long (like 500, 300), and it looked really cool on the first image, but didn't look as good on the latter 2, so i settled on 250, which still gave a similar cool effect.
i also made the front pixels smaller than before to get more colour and definition now that the background had less and also made them slightly more opaque to see the colour more.
