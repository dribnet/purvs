## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

I had to switch somet things up once I realised that I had too many parameters. I had to remove two parameters because I had 22 parameters in total. I knew that I could remove rectsizex because it was 20 in everything single form. I then had to decide what parameter to remove next, and I decided that removing offsectrectx would cause the less amount of aesthetic damage. So I tried removing it and made the rectangle(tape) constantly in the middle. I aactually like how this looks better than how It did before because I think that it makes the forms alot more interesting. 
Following this track of making my letters more interesting I wanted to make my black tape look more like real tape. So i decided to change the tape to be white and see through. This added even more interest to my letter forms I thought because you could see all the imperfections in how I placed my triangles.
And finally to add even more interest too my letter forms I decided to make each of my triagnles a different colour so you could see how each individual triangle was placed.
