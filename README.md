Theme:
My theme for this problem set grew from the emotions felt during level 4 lockdown. Originally this idea was inspired on different ways to pass time during the time spent in my flat being bored. However, this idea progressed with time and instead looked deeper into self-care practises in order to keep a "sane" mind. This was something I definitely became more aware of during lockdown and had to practise in order to not go crazy. One thing I spent a lot of time doing was drawing and doodling which is where the mask designs came from.

The images themselves are super simple, being self-portraits shot in my flat where i spent my 5 weeks in lockdown. I looked at things such as symmetry and angles to try and create a visually interesting photo out of a boring background.

When coming up with my theme I knew i wanted to create quite a graphic design image with drawing in the mask to create an almost psychedelic art that represented my emotions. I knew I wanted to include multiple masks with grey scale in order to make as much visual contrast as possible. This meant using multiple for loops with a bunch of different effects, all with different vibrant colours. I loved the way the grid system looked right from the start when experimenting with random photos, which I then progressed over time to use in my images to isolate the model. However, for the other effects in the other masks I found ti really hard to come up with a solid idea as I felt there was much possibility in terms of code manipulation and that every idea i tried I thought looked quite cool. This was a challenge as I really had to refine my work down so that it did not look to abstract/crazy. I ended up keeping a very grid based system apart from the coloured ellipses which gave a nice contrast between the two.

The masks themselves became a challenge to create and i had originally kept the mask idea the same for all 3 images, but then realised that this lacked in creativity and did not highlight what I was feeling and expressing in lockdown. This led to a lot of time spent trying to come up with mask designs that I felt truly represented the emotions felt while still keeping some sort of link to the other images in the series. In the end I was happy with my masks, but definitely felt that the 2nd mask was a lot stronger than the other 2.

Deciding on colours was an easy decision as I knew i wanted the traditional psychedelic colours of purples, pinks and oranges. It was then just about deciding when I would manipulate the colour already there or use a solid fill. In the end I think the colours in this were super successful and demonstrated my ideas well.  

I think my images are a lot different to a lot of other peoples due to the graphic nature of them which at first was quite daunting wondering if i had done it right but then I understanding that my theme, based on emotions and thoughts through self-care required an abstract thinking approach and I would not have done this differently.
