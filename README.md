## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

For the first part of my sketch I created a simple mockup of
a direction I'd like to go in using my sketch from part 3.

I decided to continue my sketch for part 3, as it lends itself well
to this project. I plan on keeping the simplicity, grid based design,
and black outlines as a core design feature. I've already got a good
base to start my sketch on. I would like to add more features and
refine the cute aesthetic.

The different sections of the mockup represent different zoom levels
of the map.

The first zoom section will be similar to what my sketch
for part 3 looked like, zoomed in so you can see individual features
such as trees and rocks.

The second zoom section will allow you to see more biomes, with various
different environmental features and colors. It won't be in blocks, like
in the mockup, but will blend out in a random pattern.

The last zoom section will attempt to divide the biomes up into sections,
and display a simple icon that shows what kind of biome it is. I'm not sure
how this will end up looking, and I would like to experiment a lot to refine
the design.
