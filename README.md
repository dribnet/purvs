### CMYK Brail Clock

The idea for this clock is to confront the visual aspect of 
a clock by being written in brail which is predominantly a
language for the blind. On the inverse however as it is a
digitally visable clock it is also inaccessable to the blind,
rendering it fairly useless for telling the time. Complexity 
is added via the overlapping of the seconds, minutes and hours
symbols, each layer represented by a colour but if a dot is used
twice it fuses the colours eg yellow and cyan will make a green.
In this way you will theoritcally be able to tell what the time is
if your brain can figure all these things out fast enough but otherwise
it is fairly useless.
