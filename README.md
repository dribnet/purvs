## Leafy ABC

I made ABC out of two ellipses and a rectangle as placeholders for leaves and a stick. I think it will be easy to make most letters with these shapes so this could be a good idea to continue with. The parameters I used to make these were: leaf2Pos, leaf2Posy, rotate1, rotate2, rotate3, stickPosx, stickPosy
