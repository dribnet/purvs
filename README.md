### Dial Clock

The dial clock is a clock which has three rotating
dials which tell the second, minute, and hour.

I've managed to get the foundation code working, with the dials turning and moving properly, with text rotating with it.
Now, I need to focus on making the clock look appealing, and how I originally wanted it to.
