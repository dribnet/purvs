Each of my letters is composed with four triangles. each point of my triangles are controlled by 6 parameters each.


The parameters for one of the triangles are:

  * `offsetx1 tri 1` : x offset of the first triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety1 tri 1` : y offset of the first triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsetx2 tri 1` : x offset of the second triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety2 tri 1` : y offset of the second triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsetx3 tri 1` : x offset of the third triangle point relative to the center
  * `offsety3 tri 1` : y offset of the third triangle point relative to the center

  this is the same for the other 3 triangles with different offset values

 So far I have coded my letters from A to M, I have not done the Interpolation yet. I have utilised the editor code to make my letters as it is a lot less time consuming than changing numbers constantly.
