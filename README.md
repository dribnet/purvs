## Assignment 1 - MDDN 242 - Creative Coding II 2018

### Super Clock Land

---

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time. Adhering roughly to the capabilities of the Super Game Boy, an add-on peripheral for the Super Nintendo.

---

#### Changes:
+ Made the alarm regenerate the island
+ Tidied up comments a bit

#### Current Issues:

+ Pretty much it I think

#### To Do:

+ Finish up this readme
+ Update the json

#### Notes:
+ I Elected not to add clouds or an underside to the island due to how they obscure the more interesting parts of the scene
+ There's some weird inconsistency in behavior between browsers and even different computers. I don't think I can do much about that one
+ Ocean does not use palette swapping scheme, though *technically* is still within the limitations of the SGB. That per-pixel function was never really used in any commercial game
