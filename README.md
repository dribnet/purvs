The type of person Zamasu is called, is a Kaioshin, Kai for short. They all aspire to one day become supreme kai’s and so I’ll be calling this a Supreme Kai Generator from this point on, as I'll be trying to incorporate features of other supreme kais into the faces. 

As a start I inserted the face from part 2 along with the five parameterised values that already existed. It looks quite nice, but some glaring things that pop out to me as becoming a bit stale between the faces are the hair, ears, and earrings. These three features I’ll look to change next.
