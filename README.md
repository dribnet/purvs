(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

This is the final version of the letter I design. 
Those letters are design for girls. I use pink and blue as the base color, and hard edge to make the letters look simple and clear.
 I keep the base shape of the letters. Use tilted line to replace the curve. The blue look like a piece of glass setting on the pink frames.

Parameter explanation:
I used 18 vertexs in total.


The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
