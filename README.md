Polygon Alphabet
=======

I have decided on the colours and style I want to go for with is an 80s theme for my font because polygons and 3D effects were a big thing in 80s design styles. The colours I chose were mustard yellow, orangey red and aqua blue because when I think of the 80s those are the colours that remind me of it, and also purple but it wouldnt have gone well in my font designs because I want darker colours. I have also completed the animation side of the project and am happy with it but I might add some movement to the design font to show a 3D computer generated effect. I have also taken out the stroke because I didnt like how it wrapped itself around the font shapes.
