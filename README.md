For now i have dropped the BLUR filter as it is causing too many issues with loading and not working. this is my chosen alphabet design
<<<<<<< HEAD

The 5 parameters per letter:
  * left : Left line of the shape
  * top : top line of shape
  * right : right line of shape
  * middle : middle line of shape
  * bottom : bottom line of shape
=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The 5 Prarameters i am using is:
Left = left side of shape.
Right = Right side of shape.
Top = Top of Shape.
Mid = Middle of shape.
Bot = bottom of shape.
