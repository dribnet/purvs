### A drop clock!

For this project my ideas are going to start with some sort of fluid movement of a numeric value dropping down into the screen and then progressively fall of the screen, going from left to right.

Another idea for this project for the clock is having a old classic hand watches with the multple different dials/clogs rotation around the centre. If i could create a new querky personality and apply it to this vintage style watch it could be interesting.
