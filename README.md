## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme:
My overall theme for these images is space and astrophotography. I chose this because outside of Uni and Work, my hobby is to take images of space such as Nebulae and Galaxies. I think it would be cool to use my images because these objects in space all have wildly different shapes, sizes and most importantly colors.

Changelog:
I have added all of my images, they maybe set to change in the future but for now they all fit my theme so they are good for testing. I still have unwanted white lines appearing due to my masks, I will work to find a way to get rid of those lines as they look out of place right now.
