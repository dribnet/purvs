Each of my letters is made up of 2 triangles. I am currently having issues with the rotation and translation of the second triangle. I may look into a different way of setting it up so I avoid using the rotate feature. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `rotate' : rotation of triangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second triangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second triangle relative to the first one

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
