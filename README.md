### Old clock

My idea for the clock is based on old forms of time keeping. I want to try something with a grandfather clock. I want to explore the idea of pendulums. 
I want to draw on my childhood memories of all the wall clocks that my grandad had. Either a stand up grandfather clock with a swinging pendulum or a wall hanging clock with weights that have to be adjusted. Maybe even have a pop out like the old cuckoo clocks.
