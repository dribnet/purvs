Did much development today in class. Realized that the AM & PM squares were redundant, because we can know whether it's AM or PM by looking outside.

Thought about and integrated stylistic choices. 

Implemented the working clock text, but not sure how I will create an interesting moving visual for the clock, since the original idea of rotating circles around the bigger circles was too complicated.

Made a colored stroke around each circle and mapped the stroke's rgb to hours,minutes,seconds.
