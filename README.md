## PS4 MDDN 342 2018


FINAL: 
The final design I have created is to magnify into the water of a Koi Pond the zoom
layers explore what the water contains and then explores the water molecule H2O. 

Zoom 0 - Koi Pond w/swimming fish
Zoom 1 - Zoomed in view of the fish moving as a pack through the pond.
Zoom 2 - Water Particles begin to emerge, moving in a random way.
Zoom 3 - Water molecule displayed as a graphic 
Zoom 4 - Displays the Water molecule as H2O. 

Review: Overall I am happy with the design I have produced. I found it very difficult to 
set the parameters of the grid and remapping each zoom function so I could draw outside 
of the grid. However, I managed to work around most of my issues and managed to get a working
final design.   


FOURTH:
The boat design didn't turn out how I would have liked it to, so I have gone with the same
concept but made a Koi fish pond instead. This design has allowed me to add randomness 
and animation to the design which is ultimately what I wanted. When zoomed in on the water 
you can see the particles moving and when zoomed in even further you can see the actual water
particles. 

THIRD: 

Layers have been added, in the mean time I am designing a boat sitting in water for the first
zoom, each layers in this example will display how the water molecules apear as zoom increases.
Animation will be coming to the water soon also.

SECOUND:

This iteration has been made through modifying the example fence 3. First I want
to design the top layer which is meant to represent a wave like motion through using 
randomness.

FIRST: 

This sketch has been developed from one of my iterations in PS3. I used shades of blue on 
a grey background for one of my wallpaper designs. It reminded me of a water molecule, this
sketch has been developed from that concept to create four layers which will you will be 
able to zoom into. 

Zoom One: Liquid motion 

Zoom Two: Stiffer closer/faster motion (boiling water)

Zoom Three: Wave motion 

Zoom Four: Static H O H
