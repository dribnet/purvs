## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So after messing around with the code for a while, I am starting to get a feel for how I want the algorithm to look. I like the look of algorithms that give finer details so I will try and stick with that. I have decided to not change the colours for the time being as it doesn't look too great right now. For the 3 photos that I will do, I will still be going with the Desk idea and have decided on the photos. The left will have gadegets like headphones, the middel will have the monitor, and the right will have a stack of books. Basically I bunch of stuff that I like. I have also been messing with the photos and should have them in the next update with a more final design.
