### The concept of clock

I just want to show my concept of my clock. I was inspired by the traditional philosophy. That means the time is equitable for anyone so that it keeps the balance in the world. I just want to give the sense of contrast to show the balance.
The further idea aiming at putting all the elements together to create the cohesive aesthetic style. when the inside circle rotate, it pour the white or black into the outside circle.
That's just a rough idea.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your
image above. You can also include
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
