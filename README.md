## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Andrija Djorovic

After a few iterations and experiment, I finally found a custom pixel that I enjoy and find visually pleasing, that also holds my previous points; using hexagons as the main(or all in this iterations) element and the background and foreground focus of the theme.

I added more images that follow the theme, using simple and mono-coloured(or duo with the water) background.

I looked into the smartmask but in the end I found in to as detailed as I wanted. With the foreground holding  a big part of the image, as well as a big problem with my there of a clear foreground vs background. As such I made a one image with my custom mask and one with the smartmask.
