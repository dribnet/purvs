## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is just a touchup to my previous commit, I changed the mask around for the third image to highlight different chess peices which I believe is more effective. I also went through my first and third image and added the same 'glitchy' effect that I did in my second image by adding random pixels to the mask that make it look like its broken, and I went through and added the small ellipse at each of the points of convergence of the grid in both areas of the mask, black fill in the 'filled in' areas of the mask to create contrast as usually these are bright colours, and then I kept the 'pix' colour of the ellipse in the grid outside of the mask, I really like this effect. I'm still not sure about how I chose to do the masks. I think just using masks to crop out the focus points of image is really boring and makes the output look to predescribed and manufactured. I want to go for the kind of 'glitchiness' effect that feels organic. I think thats why I liked my previous very abstract commit a lot, because the colours were created just through experimentation, I didn't plan that appearance out. In this commit I also went through and tidied up a lot of my code as it was extremely messy. Since I am repeating my pixel in the different areas of the masks, just with different colours and strokes, I chose to create a function just for the pixel, and then call it in an if statement based around the mask. This reduced a lot of the code. I also went through and commented everything, which was a lot easier and faster than some of my other coding projects.
