(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I have started porting my code into draw letters

For my sketch. Each of my letters is composed an arc circle and a triangle. The size and position of the arcis fixed, but location of the arc start and end changes. the location and size of the triangle changes to complete the letterform

The 6 parameters per letter:
  * `size` : used to change the width of the trianlge
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the triangle relative to the circle
  * `offsety` : y offset of the triangle relative to the circle
   * `ArcStart` : starts the arc for the main circle
   * `ArcEnd` : ends the arc for the main circle
   * `TrianglePoint` : is used to change where the bottom right corner of the triangle is used to get around using a rotate function

   For the final letterforms i am looking an english design studio Spin. They do a lot of interesting generative and interactive letterform and fonts


   I have since started reconsidering my alphabet idea. What i am considering doing is constructing each letter as
