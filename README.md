## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this commit i have added in my own images that i have found inspiring. all these images have been taken around wellington in places that i have remembered seeing.

When initially putting my images in i didnt like how flat they looked and wanted to make it look at little more inspiring and have the artwork pop of the canvas. I decided to change my rects that were the main artwork of my images and have them offset slightly. This gave it a nice 3d sort of effect.

After playing around with this a little more i have discovered that it works a lot better with colourful things, as my image three isnt that great but my first two i really like.

from here i want to play around a bit more with my masking and do some more manually and try work out stuff that enhances the images to make them inspiring to others. I have started doing this in image two and so far i think it works quite well as it captures the image and highlights a lot of the distinctive feaures.
