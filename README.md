## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Another design i thought of. I swapped the squares and circles so that the circles now create the background. I have also made a changed to the circles, so i added a smaller inside the circle giving it more of a different looking effect which i like the look of. I don't think this is my favourite deisng as the main focus isn't on the sky anymore.
