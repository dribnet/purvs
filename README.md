## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I changed the stroke weight to be thinner and changed the colour of the small circle to be red. I adjusted the size and positions of the lines and circles to fir better now that I've removed strokes and changed the stroke width.

I really like the "cut-out" sections because it gives and interesting look and shape to the letters. The red gives it some colour and adds interest instead of it being black and white. 

The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
