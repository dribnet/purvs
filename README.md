## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have added more photos as a test, which are two friends of mine.  Who are close to me. The capture at the start is to capture the moments I shared with them. 

The capture represents me capturing memories and storing it somewhere.

One sitting down on a couch and one walking up stairs. Continued using Tom's code with some minor changes to the sizes of the ellipes.

The couch I wanted to capture the person with ellipses. 

The one walking up, I wanted to capture the green which were little branches and I masked the person walking up as well.
