Here I have experimented with the code including noise. I wanted to have an abstract landscape which relates to my pattern. This landscape was at first not intentional, but after looking at it longer I actually think it is quite interesting. It has some good contrast and the grey areas look like clouds. Abstractly, this could be interpreted as a cityscape from top view on a cloudy day. 

The main issue I am frustrated and having issues with is the fact it generates the designs very slowly. I want to figure out how I could keep this asthetic but make the code run faster. 

Also to switch to pattern mode you can press the space bar.
