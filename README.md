## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Part 3: Playing around with Grids

I have used Phoebe's code in making the grid style image. It was interesting to play around with but I'm not sure if it suits my theme. Since my theme is about emphasising the unique appearance of each plants leaves I don't think it will highlight that aspect too much using grids. I've looked at the past years work and I was intrigued by the wavy appearance by Brock. I might experiment with the wavy style in the future. I am also planning on experimenting with using lines and triangles to form my image, as that may highlight the small details better.
