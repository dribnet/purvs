## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I chose three photos all taken in New Zealand. First one in Rotorua, second in Hamilton, third one is Napier. New Zealand is such a beautiful country which is why I want to show it through these pictures. Currently the circle & Rectangle point size are all different as I am still exploring designs.
