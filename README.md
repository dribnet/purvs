## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

I was focusing on animation on this part. For me, the most diffcult part is to make rotation for the tail part. I realized I can't use p5.rotate() directly in this code. It effected all the elements in the canvas. So I changed p5.rotate() as p5.sin() and p5.cos().

For animation, I will think more about Marill's facial expression. Because when we move to zoom3, it is hardly to see all the things I drew. Therefore, I will make more effort on facial expressions.

Zoom 0: Poke balls
Zoom 1: half Poke balls
Zoom 2: half Poke balls & tail part
Zoom 3: half Poke balls & head part

This part: updated both images keeping their original sizes:
