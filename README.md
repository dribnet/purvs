   The idea of this concept is from the audio pitch. 
   The yellow arc show the level of pitch.
   For example the A tone is lower tha C tone, 
   the arc of A is more smooth than the arc of C.
   
   x,y2 and x5,y5 control the blue arc
   x2,y3 and x6,y6 control the filled arc
   x3,2y and x7,y7 control the green arc
