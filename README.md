## Powers of 10 PRINT

For my pattern I wanted to allude to the idea of lines of code and wiring, making up the foundation of the computer.

I adopted an abstract style to help influence a more appealing aesthtic. I pursued a bold and simple geometric style, using repetitive variation to create a visually interesting image.

I chose to have three different dot / line lengths as I felt this offered enough variety, while still remaining structured.

The colours were chosen to be bold and vivid, aluuding to the idea of various networks of wires and code.

Moving forward I will need to adapt this pattern into the infinite space.
