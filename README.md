## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I just uploaded my final sketch, this final sketch shows how I want my final alpahabet to go.  The grey rectangles are going to be roads, and the red rectangles will be the cars).  I will add road lines (white/yellow dotted line to create sides of the road) and include regular streetlamps/bushes etc. 


I have a half working alphabet currently, however I need to do a lot more.  Right now, my letters are using 21 parameters, so I am going to change it to less.   Therefore, I need to be strategic on what 'cars' go where.   I also want to design the rectangle boxes into more details -adding dotted lines and bushes.  

As you can see, I have cleaned up a little bit my 'cars', however, now I've decided they can't be crashing so will spread them apart again.   I have also added traffic lights and the road lines to make sure my design looks like a road!   I think this already looks a lot better, and I like the theme that is starting to go on.  I decided to change my design up a lot more to neaten it up!

and again

started to spread my cars out again :). 

Spreaded out my cars, this way they're not crashing!


Final write-up: 

I have made an alphabet through inspiration of a road from a birds eye view.   My rectangles that are shown driving along both sides of the road, make up the letter, whilst the background remains a road - with traffic lights on either side.  


My font is made up of two major components - the rectangles, (whiich are coded to be the red rectangles (also kown as my cars)), as well as the background road pattern.   I used red for the colour of my cars, simply because lightning McQueen was red in 'cars' by Disney!  I then designed a road by figuring out what exactly a birds eye view of a road would look like.   I like the overall look as it is quite cute!  

When creating my alphabet, I started with a slow process of just trying to dissect and understand all parts of the code and what it was asking me to do in certain places - this is important for me to fully understand the software before I can start!  Honestly, by doing this I got to learn the software more, and over the time of having the assignment, I learnt a lot more about code - leaving me feeling more confident and to have a deeper understanding of the subject!   

A thing that I did at the start of the assignment, and for no apparent reason?  Was setting the x's and y's to have original paramaters, but this just made me have to use quite a lot of negative numbers.  Before I realised why I was using such negative numbers, it was too late to change.   That is something I would change for the next process! 

I chose 5 parameters - three of which are rectangles that go downwards, whilst the other two are rectangles that go across!    I chose the lucky number 5 after I sketched my alphabet as hand-drawn, and realised that my lowest-maximum paramater I could use was 5!    I ended up changing a lot of my font in the last day (past the time the assignment was due), and honestly I'm really happy I took the late penalty, as I know I've produced much better work!  :)  


Overall, this assignment has been challenging but has made me understand a looooot more about coding!  Normally coding can be extremely intimidating, however, with this project - I have gained a lot of confidence in which I can take into the third project - and I'm really excited to be able to better my skills and show off more of my understanding!
