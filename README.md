## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Thought it was going to be hard but I have implemented the 'masking function' into my code and have created a mask for the 3rd image input. I have masked it so the viewer can distinguish between the sky and the rock pool mass. The code I have generates randomly placed points(lines) that are pushed around by a flowfield force, the colour input is based on the rgb and alpha values of the image which is assigned to a variable and input into the stroke colour. The 'mask function' changes the line weights so when drawing the sky the line weight is thinner(strokeweight of 1) and the rock mass has thicker lines(strokeweight of 25). For this image I generated 1000 particles. I want to try and add more parameters to my code as it is generatively created currently.

I chose this image because it fits my cultural/environment theme. It fits the cultural theme as I see it as a representation of the Maori mythological story of Rangi and Papa and the Ta-Va theory through my explanation in my last commit.
