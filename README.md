This program draws either a wallpaper, or a landscape.
You can press the spacebar to switch between the modes.
You can click on the canvas to generate a new wallpaper or landscape.

--Wallpaper--
The wallpaper uses simple rects and lines
to create a detailed pattern. It uses the same shapes
as the landscape, but colored and sized differently.

The color scheme is neon and bright, randomly changing between 3 color schemes.
taking inspiration from future japanese night lighting. The goal of this wallpaper
is to create an aesthetically pleasing composition using simple shapes to create
a complex pattern.

--Landscape--

I changed the landscape to be a black and white, minimalist map. In the future I
intend to add more shapes to make it seem more like an actual environment, such as
trees and rivers.
