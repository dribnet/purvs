## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.


So because im in austria right now i thought i would try using photos i have taken while here

tried two different pictures each with only one mask so far - now im going to change the effects before i experiment with multiple masks

Changing shapes and stroke, now im going to work on multiple masks
everything unmasked is foreground
