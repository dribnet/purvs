My letters are built up of a fixed rectangle, in addition to two further rectangles and two squares the location of these four being controlled by 8 parameters. 

The 8 parameters per letter:

3:

Square One: (centre right)
  "sq1x": Position of the square on the X axis 
  "sq1y": Position of the square on the Y axis
Square Two: (bottom centre)
  "sq2x": Position of the square on the X axis 
  "sq2y": Position of the square on the Y axis 
Rect Three: (top left)
  "rect1x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect1y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis
Rect Four: (centre left)
  "rect2x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect2y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis

4:

Square One: (centre centre)
  "sq1x": Position of the square on the X axis 
  "sq1y": Position of the square on the Y axis
Square Two: (bottom right)
  "sq2x": Position of the square on the X axis 
  "sq2y": Position of the square on the Y axis 
Rect Three: (bottom left)
  "rect1x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect1y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis
Rect Four: (top right)
  "rect2x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect2y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis
