## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

First week
I started trying some ideas. I would like to be able to combine the traditional alphabet and the Braille alphabet. I also started to see what a combination of colors can be. This time try something monochromatic on each letter using a different color.

Second week
In my second week I was researching about alphabets and how to implement my idea. My main problem is the limitation of parameters that we have, in this work I would like my letters to be as close as possible to the real letters and not to be so abstract.

Holidays

on my vacation I broke some git and I can't make changes to the page. anyway I kept working on my alphabet but I did not save the changes and I only have a copy on my computer that I will keep when I can fix it.

I decided to make the letters as similar as possible to the original alphabet and I decided to use capital letters, in my opinion it is more aesthetic to maintain a unified height size with all the letters



<!-- Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one -->
