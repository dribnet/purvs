### Super Clock Land

---

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time while waterfalls splash into the ocean below, aesthetically adhering roughly to the capabilities of the Super Game Boy, an add-on peripheral for the Super Nintendo that was capable of recolouring greyscale Game Boy games in 8x8 pixel regions.


This design isn't typical for a p5.js scene, but I wanted to push myself and see what I could do under these constraints.
The time is represented by colour changes in the scene and the rotation of the island. The alarm exhibits the palette-swapping techniques in action, and will also regenerate the island scenery.

I'm most pleased with the water effect, which relies on the order of iteration across pixels to create the shimmering flow by manipulating the red and green components.

By the end of this project I was running up against many inconsistencies and weird behaviours in drawing to the canvas that made it difficult to add more elements to the scene, which is regrettable but was difficult to plan for. I have done my best to mitigate these.

Were I to do this again, I'd have the scene viewed from the middle of a much larger island instead, with a more sophisticated camera and detailed landmass so that I could populate it with plants and animals. This would also be an opportunity for having more parts of the scene driven by the individual time components.


Ultimately this was a very rewarding project that I gained a lot from and I'm glad I was able to pursue this aesthetic.
