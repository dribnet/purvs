## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Exhibition
   
I added in the last part to the code which was the exhibition and I think that it works well. I like how the animation looks, how it rolls and rotates along to form a new word. Typing it out looks really interesting as well which the rotation of the arcs. I like the colours and opacity which I think fit well with the letter forms. The animation is smooth and it doesn't fly too far away with each of the letters changing along, rotating, and flying in different directions is cool. 
I chose the name crescent for my letter forms because the colours and the arcs reminded me of the crescent moon. The soft light dark blue and white fits well together and I think that it is better than just plain black and white. 
Looking at the various letter I like how they turned out in that they sit high and low as well as in different angles which makes it more visually interesting. It is simple and difficult to read in a way which is what I want it to be. 
My next steps is to refine and clean up the code and see if there is anything I need to add or can improve. However as of now I am pretty happy with how it turned out. 


pos2x this draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y this draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x this draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 this rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 this rotates the inner arc
