## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I changed the size of the squares and ellipses as well as the background colour to black. The mask is ovee her eyes to show the contrast.

The images above are photos of my friend from an assignment from last year in the studio algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects.
