## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The image shown is the result of my 'mask' generating code that essentially functions as a sort of edge detection, with white areas representing areas with higher contrast and black with less. I will be using this information to drive a turtle-based tendril visualisation.

This code was actually largely written a little bit ago, but health problems have gotten in the way of working on this a bit.

I believe this backing mask will serve my image concept of "Connectivity" well, by using the contrast areas for chance of tendril splitting.

#### Issues:

- Values might be a bit too noisy for my intended purpose.

#### To-Do:

- Implement a map-smoothing component to the delta map function.

#### Notes:
