### Overflow Clock

Initially the concept of the clock was to 'overflow' the user with information whilst still presenting the current time differentiated. This was a play on the capacity of information as well as the mundane and simple design of a classic digital clock. This goes further overboard with the alarm. As the alarm goes off, every number and the background is red or near red with variation to present the number and background differently. Although the alarm in combination is very obnoxious, the current time is very predominant and is consistentally clear. 

The design is not intended to be confusing but rather present the viewer with information that is not needed or not necessary and still draw the current time in a varrying color. Life and the internet especially can be filled with a overcapacity of buffer surrounding what your essentially looking for. On websites, there are ads, in stores there is a large variety in terms of products, even when rewriting text the selection of editors is far and wide. This clock was meant to represent the confusion and the overabundance of information that surrounds our day to day lives. However, at the end of last few seconds of every minute, the numbers clear from the canvas and the expanding area from the center without random numbers, are intentionally meant to represent lucidy and clarity that comes from finding what was searched for or the lapse moments of the day. 

Overall, throughout the project the largest issue fell on how to cascade the numbers properly as well as correctly portray the overflow in a way that isnt too confusing and astray from the original concept. After playing with blendMode() and different gradients I overcame the complexity and found that a basic palette of contrasting and complementing colors made more of an impact than continuously changing backgrounds and numbers. As this drew even further from the currently drawn time, and thus defeating the point of the clock itself. Four different map functions and two different random arrays create the background numbers as well as a variety of different individual functions that form the project.
