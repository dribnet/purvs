I was having a lot of trouble getting my old code to function properly and map correctly with the zoom. So I have basically redone it all, using code from other students as a guide. I've decided to switch from triangles to quadratic shapes as this allows a lot more options. I have just have a basic pattern set up rihht now but I will continue to add to it.
