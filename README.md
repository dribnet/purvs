## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The three images on top are my experiment not my finals. I just wanted to see how I can do this assignment and what I can do for my theme. 

The pictures I have chosen are pictures of different coloured sunset I have took when I was back in Nelson. The family house in Nelson has a beautiful view of the beach and the sunset. It's sometimes different colours. So I had to choose that theme as I always love watching the sunset.
