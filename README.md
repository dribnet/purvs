  "sq1y": Position of the square on the Y axis
Square Two: (bottom centre)
  "sq2x": Position of the square on the X axis 
  "sq2y": Position of the square on the Y axis 
Rect Three: (top centre)
  "rect1x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect1y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis
Rect Four: (top right)
  "rect2x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect2y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis

7:

Square One: (centre right)
  "sq1x": Position of the square on the X axis 
  "sq1y": Position of the square on the Y axis
Square Two: (top left)
  "sq2x": Position of the square on the X axis 
  "sq2y": Position of the square on the Y axis 
Rect Three: (bottom centre)
  "rect1x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect1y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis
Rect Four: (bottom right)
  "rect2x": Position of the rectangle on the X axis
  "rect2y": Position of the rectangle on the Y axis
