## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I had afew problems with my last commits where my exhibtion html wouldnt show, all solved now though as I had renamed my exhibition.html index.html instead of actually changing the code manually. So try to ignore the last few commits I did by accident. Anyways.. Afew last minute changes with colours! I though I would go and changed the hard black background to a all white background for the exhibition and the alphabet. I did this because I thought that the black washed the colour out too much and you could see how the stroke points on the triangles would'nt meet nicely with one another. I decided to match the background colour to the stroke so that the edges look really clean and that the white line passing through the triangles would look as though it breaked the two triangles up so they look as though they are seperated. This was a good design decision because the white emphasises the form and shape of the letters without the background becoming distracting.

My letter parameters


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 3y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.

opacity - colour opacity

strokeWeight - weight of the shape stroke
