(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Each of my letters consist of 4 cresents made up of 2 arcs each, all based at the center and rotating outward from there. None of the postions are fixed and they all move with the letter and are postioned so they dont overlap most of the time.

The eight parameters per letter:
  * `rot1`: Controls rotation of Arc1
  * `rot2`: Controls rotation of Arc2
  * `rot3`: Controls rotation of Arc3
  * `rot4`: Controls rotation of Arc4
  * `offsetx1`: Controls the X offset of Arc1
  * `offsetx2`: Controls the X offset of Arc2
  * `offsetx3`: Controls the X offset of Arc3
  * `offsetx4`: Controls the X offset of Arc4
  * `offsety1`: Controls the Y offset of Arc1
  * `offsety2`: Controls the Y offset of Arc2
  * `offsety3`: Controls the Y offset of Arc3
  * `offsety4`: Controls the Y offset of Arc4
=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
