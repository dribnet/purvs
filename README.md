## Hexagons - The Bestagons
Today I created a hexagonal design for my font, the idea came from [CGP Gray's "Hexagons are the Bestagons"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY) video. I'm not sure about how it will work with interpolation and how some letters like e could be improved, so this is definitely not the final idea.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `visible` : 10 length array of numbers denoting the visibility of each of the hexagons
