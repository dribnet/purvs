This is my own clock for Project One, and I change some codes in the sublime. After reviewing from the previous sketch drawing. I changed my mind for the design of my own clock, I would rather using waving effects than simple circle expanding. Therefore, I coded a files for background effect 1, a huge amount of ellipses moves with the transformation in width, height, PositionX, PositionY. In the second background effect, I use the codes arc() to create the lightyear's effect. For the clock itself, I want it look more like a digital device for timing. The colour selection, I choose pink and ligthblue and they are exactly a good combination. 

Correction in the next step:
I would try to make the number more like a modern digitalised text. 

And continue fixing some unperfect things in the clocl and background.

Attempt to adjust the lighting of background, make it brighter during daytime and dark at night.

:)

In the second Step, I coded the background effect and the waving would be changed due to hours. And then I start coding the clock outline for next step, I also change some unperfect arcs with adding some fading for each arcs. For color, I change the brightness for two color, there is a contrast for colour section. Thus we can easily see the time. Lastly, I just add the millis clock with gray colour.  

And the coding and designing, I would try making digital style for my own clock.
