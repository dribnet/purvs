## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I have chosen for my photos is my experience going to Japan a few years ago. The first input photo is of a shelter where I'm living now, the second is a torii gate I visited in Hiroshima and the third is some things I bought while I was in Japan; a giant shoji piece and a geisha doll with a fan in the background. I chose these photos because they show three different sides of the experience; being in New Zealand, being in Japan and the things that stay with me after the experience. I also chose these photos because they are visually similar in the colours with reds, browns and light blues. This visual connection also ties them together with the idea that different cultures are connected and influence each other and the people interacting with them.
