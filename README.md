Stress final

I'm kinda over this whole stress thing. It really just seems empty. I'm either going to go back to my comfort based one, as I think it has more of a message (Showing you can find comfort in many different places), or maybe look at how just a handful of seemingly random objects can accurately portray a person's character, if I can get the kind of images I want. Yes I realise there are only two days of this left. No, I'm not sure I'll enjoy them.
