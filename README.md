## Part 3 - Randomizer
The colour is a discrete value of either oranges, blue or purple. Each colour has focused random variables accordingly. I wanted the orange one more eye catching with a brighter colour, bigger scale and different mouth shape. It is meant to express more shock.

The blue is the most calm with its mouth closed. While the purple is just slightly shocked and slightly out of it/spaced out.
