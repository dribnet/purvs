I have animated the clouds to move up the screen to give the illusion that the parachuters are falling. The animation is a a bit choppy when it is faster but If I make it slow and smooth then it is too slow to notice. I have kept it fast for this so it is noticeable. 

I haven't figured out how to make the parachuters swing without being cut off by the grid.
