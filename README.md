Here is a progress pic of my alphabet so far, I also changed the green and blue to a red and blue. I really like the colour balance with the form of the letter, it really unifies the whole thing. The shadow in between the two shapes is also a really cool feature.


My letter parameters

section y - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - x offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.


section 2x - y offset of the first triangle relative to the first one.
