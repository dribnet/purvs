## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have started experimenting with the code and changing minor things like the colour mode and size of the objects to get an idea of how the code works etc 



The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
