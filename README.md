### Outrageous clock

My second idea is to have a normal digital clock but with a pill-like eclipse as the background underneath it. The "pill" with be divided in two sides, left and right. One side for displaying the hour and one for minute. The way this clock displays second is by changing the colour of 2 sides of the pill into eachother's current colour per sec. For the alarm funcition, I want the display of the hour and minute to keep enlarging and getting smaller repeatedly and nonstopply until someone clicks the clock to stop or snooze it.
I think this clock idea is the most doable but still can be a cool design.
