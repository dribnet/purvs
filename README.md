## PS2 MDDN 242 2019 - Sketch

I made some small adjustments to the alphabet.

Each of my letters is composed with one arc and one line. The size of the arc is fixed, but the length of the line and location and angles of both arc and line is controlled by eight parameters.

The eight parameters per letter:

  * `lineX1` : The x coordinate of the first point of the line
  * `lineY1` : The y coordinate of the first point of the line

  * `lineX2` : The x coordinate of the second point of the line
  * `lineY2` : The y coordinate of the second point of the line

  * `arcX` : The x coordinate of the center of the arc
  * `arcY` : The y coordinate of the center of the arc

  * `start` : The angle in degrees of where the arc starts
  * `stop` : The angle in degrees of where the arc stop
