## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final: 

For my 3 photos I select is sunrise mid-day and sunset, I take those photo on those day, the color change of the sky especially interesting, I use code "rotate", cause I find if I give this rotate code a big number it makes some space, it highlights my main part of the photo. I also use code "triangle", this code helps me draw a sunshine line, those nice line simulation a real sun in the bottom left side which is cool. One thing I not happy with that is I don't know how to change the position of the triangle because my 3 photo is sunrise mid-day and sunset, I try to put that at a different position, so the line can start form differents sun position.
