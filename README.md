## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

With some help from the tutor Michael, I managed to create a for loop for the lines that are the rays of sunshine coming out the rainbow. This looks much better, and the fact that it's in a for loop means the lines are all perfectly even. To make each ray a different colour of the rainbow I created an array which contained all the colours, and then inside where I called the stroke colour I had the array % by the array length, this basically meant that for each line, the for loop would cycle through each of the five colours, when it got to the fifth colour and realised there was no more to cycle to, it would return back to the first colour. This is a new piece of code I havem't used so I'm excited to use it more in the future.


I also spent some time moving my code from sketch.js into drawletters.js. It's a little messy at the moment, as the rays of sunshine are too big for each letter canvas in alphabet.js, so this is my next mission. However I'm happy with my progress so far.
