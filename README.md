## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - 31/05/19

Progress Update

I'm still experimenting with and trying to get my head around using grids, and I came up with this. I like it because I could use it to completely obscure things in an image like they've gone missing or disappeared. If I use sustainability as a theme, I could use this to take trees/natural elements out of the picture.
