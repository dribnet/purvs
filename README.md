### Episode 05 day/night shift

After figuring out how to change the background colours in the previous episode. It was now time to step up the alternatives in the change of colour.

Which was to make the colour alternate between day and night for the numbers, this way the colours for the analog time are easily desirably understood when the day/night shift colours.

the current update to this is shown above. The next step is to find a way to make this more interesting than it currently is set out now.

(tip: the current change in colour is set to sec, due for testing purpose, and will be later drafted into the hourly sections soon)

TUNE IN FOR MORE.. clockity clock works.
