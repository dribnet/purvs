Style 3:

I decided to go with another abstract shape design, but this time bringing in a curve as the main form. Each letter will contain a curve and at least one line. There are 4 parameters controlling each of the two lines and 2 parameters controlling the arc curve. To develop this idea further, I would like to bring in some colour and maybe trial with the idea of using transparancy for the curve.

The 10 parameters per letter:

    arc start: angle in degrees of ring start point
    arc end: angle in degrees of ring end point
    line1(2) length: length of line
    line1(2) tilt: angle in degrees of line
    line1(2) x: x axis position of line
    line1(2) y: y axis position of line
