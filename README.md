## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Thankfull I read feedback from project 1, and one of the things I took away was to speak about my process more. Like why I made choices and instances where maybe I don't like something, and think it could be better etc.

So to catch-up on things that I have done previously...
At first I wasn't sure about the 'a', because the circles are so close together and I just thought it looked a bit weird, but when returning to the computer after a break, and seeing the image from a distance, I thought it all looked fine and readable.

I chose to only make visible 2 circles for the 'c', because it looks clean. Same idea for the 'i'.
I probably could have used less or no circles on the 'L', but I wanted to include them because I think it's a part of the font theme. 

I decided to make the 'e' the way it is, because having the circles like that allows me to have the curved top of a lowercase 'e'.

I chose to make the 'f's top cicle a bit higher instead of being level with the top of the rectangle, because I thought it looked better with a curved look instead of a straight and stiff look.
Likewise for the way the 'h' is curved.


One thing I am finding is, I'm not sure about the gaps between geometry in some cases.
I think it is more readable to have geometry closer together, so I might come back to letters such as, 'e' & 'n'.


I'm currently unsure about the 'm' and the '0'.
I expect to give it a few days, and come back with a new design for those.




I feel like the stroke could be darker.









I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
