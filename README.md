## PS2 MDDN 242 2018


This is my final of PS2, and I firstly want to created diamond-shaped font by using only vertex(), but I found that there would be more 12 parameters, as a result, I gave up the first idea. I used the backup version, the font of the final is called Magic Circle and the reason is they are formed by three different ellipses. I get inspired from Ancient font (Maya) and Magic patterns in Star Wars. My idea is about creating new font replaces English letters. It is an abstract font.In conclusion, I think this project is interesting, especially the final exhibition the letters can be formed into different words, although my font is strange, but it is funny for looking the combinations. First one is 55555555 and the following word is STAR WARS. My Favorite movie.  



There are 10 parameters in total,
they control postion of the two lines and three ellipse (even the radius of ellipses).
And then the lines and a diamond shape is the key element for every letters. 

The parameters:
size_i is controlling the diameter of ellipse one 
size2 is controlling the diameter of ellipse two
size3 and size4 are controlling the diameter of last ellipse

xi,yi,x1,y1,x2,y2 these are the position of ellipses.

For final font's color selection, I chose my favourite color light green, and black background.

For 26 letters, each shapes is represented a letter, for instance, first shape in first row is A. 

For numbers, I also make different shapes for ten numbers. For example, first shape in last row that is 0.

10 parameters:
xi x_co-ordinate of ellipse1 
yi y_co-ordinate of ellipse1
x1 x_co-ordinate of ellipse2 
y1 y_co-ordinate of ellipse2
x2 x_co-ordinate of ellipse3 
y2 y_co-ordinate of ellipse3

size_i : width and height of ellipse1
size2  : width and height of ellipse2
size3  : only width of ellipse3
size4  : only height of ellipse3

!_!
