Each of my letters are built with four static triangles arranged to make a square as well as one square on top which cuts through the triangles to create the letters. The triangles can change colour and transparency which will also help form the shape of the letters.

 The Seven parameters per letter
 * =========================== *
  * `topFill` : Fill for top triangle
  * `rightFill` : Fill for right triangle
  * `bottomFill` : Fill for bottom triangle
  * `leftFill` : Fill for left triangle
  * `SquareFill` : Fill for Square (usually white but colour is more flexable than booleans)
   
 Irrelevant at the moment but neccisary for future Letters
 * ===================================================== *
  * `quadHorozontal` : Squares position on X axis relative to where the letter is drawn
  * `quadVerticle` : Squares position on Y axis relative to where the letter is drawn
