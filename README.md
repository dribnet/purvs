# Feedback
Tweeked my letters to ressemble the bahaus movement a bit more. To do so, I added a stroke arround each letter as the bauhaus movement usually as a bit of black.
I also chose to change the background colour from black to white for the overall design to go easy on our eyes.

# Interpolations
I started playing around with interpolations, making the shape sizes go towards the default before moving to the new shape size.

# other student's work
Found that another student has a very similar font to mine!
We had a talk and her idea is very interesting as well.
She was trying to recreate the pop art movement in her font whereas mine is inspired by Bauhaus.

# Other comments
My "w" and "M" are slightly out of the boxes
But it seems fine on the exhibition view.


# Inspiration
This alphabet takes inspiration from [**Wassily Kandinsky**](https://www.wassilykandinsky.net), a Russian painter and pioneer of abstract art (1866-1944).
The [**Bauhaus art**](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/be/fb/afbefbd7da9a1aea6ddf6237a48f7b50.jpg) movement inspires the colour palette because Kandinsky took part in it.

# Letters composition
Each of my letters is composed of a circle, an arc and a rectangle. The size and position of each shape vary, the arc start and end, the rectangle rotation, and the rectangle rotation.

# Parameters
There are twelve parameters per letter:
  * `size` : height of the rectangle
  * `recOffsetx` : x offset of the rectangle
  * `recOffsety` : y offset of the rectangle
  * `rectAngle` : angle of rotation of the rectangle

  * `size1` : radius of the ellipse
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the ellipse
  * `offsety` : y offset of the ellipse

  * `size2` : radius of the arc
  * `arcOffsetx` : x offset of the arc
  * `arcOffsety` : y offset of the arc
  * `angleStart` : angle start for the arc
  * `angleEnd` : angle end for the arc
