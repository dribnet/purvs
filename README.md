## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Alphabet

To achieve a visual layout of a complete letter form, I placed the “barbell” on different location in a vertical or horizon way, experimenting with different start point and the end point of black and white lines (“levers”).

I didn’t figure out how to incline rectangles instead of only vertically or horizontally demonstrating them; obviously, there still need a few steps to achieve the most ideal page outlook as my assumption due to limits in my technical capability.

20 parameters:

The blue rectangle:
  rx1: rectangle x position
  ry1: y position
  rw1: width
  rh1: height
  

  x, y position, width, height of mint green: rectangle:
  rx2
  ry2
  rw2
  rh2

  x, y position, width, height of yellow: rectangle:
  rx3
  ry3
  rw3
  rh3
  
  x, y position, width, height of white line:
  lx1
  ly1
  ex1
  ey1
  
  x, y position, width, height of black line:
  lx2
  ly2
  ex2
  ey2
