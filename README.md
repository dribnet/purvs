## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I tried setting up the grid thing and fooled around with that for a bit but I'm not sure I like it. I think I'm going to make another layer in grey on my masks so I can try to make the composition more interesting. seeing as the pictures arn't that great I'll have to make up for that in other areas. I'm still not sure where I want to go with this in terms of what I want the pictures to be like. I was thinking about having some areas random and some in a grid form.
