## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've updated the thumbnail and preview to include all 3 image outputs.
I've also updated my theme slightly- I want to shift focus from promotion of local music in general, to promotion of my friend Gajuar (Cathal Dickson). This is for 2 reasons. Firstly, I rewatched Phoebes video about theme and something she said stuck with me, about how the theme should be something you're proud of. I'm so proud of Cathal and his artistry, and want to give it the recognition it deserves. The second reason is that it was hard to visually link photos of different artists together. By having it be just Gajuar, I can use similar looking photos and have a text element on all of them. I currently have split my draw function up into different code for each image, but I don't know if that is what we're meant to be doing.
I'm really concerned about the amount of rendering that I need to do. I can't get the image to be filled, with no background visible, without 100,000 loops at the very least. I don't know if I've messed up the code or if the elements I'm drawing are too small.
