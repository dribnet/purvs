## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel Experiment 1

In this update, I attempt to mask the background with my
empty heart glyph from PS3 and turn the empty heart glyph
to a full heart by filling the heart glyph once the image
is finished render. But I realise that it won't work out
the way I want it to. I think it is because the image is done
rendering so I can't make any changess to an already done
image. Placing an png on top works is because it is not
changing anything to the already rendered image but just
placing the png on top.

The reason why I want to mask my empty heart glyph in
is because it matches how the person in the image
feel. Empty heart background when the image is rendering
into a bias perspective(with just 1 religion glyph on
model's skin/hair) to show they are empty inside when
others are linking their skin colour to a specific religion.
Full heart when they can be themselves(when the image is 
actually done, png art is placed on top).

Sadly I can not achieve this effect otherwise I think
it will add more meanings to this project.
