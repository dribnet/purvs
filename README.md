Alphabet Change Log - 15/05/2020

Alphabet Letters change log.
Here's the changes I made to each letter and why. *adjusted means the letter was sized because it was either too big or small and minor changes to the triangle points.

*ADJUSTED: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, S, V, W, X
*NO_CHANGES: Q, U, Y,
A: redesigned because it looked too empty, couldn't really see the triangle.
C: redesigned because I used the gray box as the main shape to make the letter C, but it didn't blend well with the other created letters
O: redesigned, same issue as C. There was too much gray.
R: slight redesign, it looked flat and not as sharp as my other letters, so I made the triangle slope.
W: filled in the gap connecting the letter
