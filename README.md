My parameters are as follows:

triangle 1
pos2x, pos2y, pos3x, pos3y, pos4x, pos4y);


triangle 2
pos2x2, pos2y2, pos2x3, pos2y3, pos2x4, pos2y4);


 triangle 3
 pos3x2, pos3y2, pos3x3, pos3y3, pos3x4, pos3y4);
  
  
 quad
 x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);

 As of yet, I haven't had any luck getting anything drawn in my editor. I have managed to change some of the other colourschemes in my search for wherever the break in my code is though. I have an update of what my editor looks like under "sketch editor".
