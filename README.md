FACES ONE AND TWO

So far I have put my parameters for face 1 (Panda) which are : face height, mouth curve, ear type and cheek type/blush and for face 2 (Brown Bear) which are : face height, mouth width, ear type, and eye patches type. I am going to have three ear types for each bear and am aiming to have three options for all of the discrete variables. I still need to finish adding my parameters for face three and then refine the overall look and function of my faces and the arrangement. I would like to create more differences between the faces so I will continue to work on that. 

UPDATE: I have updated some of face 3 (ears and colours) and added mouth curve to face 1.
