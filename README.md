My inspiration for the creation of this font was Ancient Mayan civilization, in particular the technique in which they used 90 degree, geometric forms in order to create a variety of imagery and lettering. I wanted to take inspiration from this and create something similar when designing my letter-forms.

To get to this stage of the design , I went through many iterations with different rectangle positions, thicknesses and spacing. I have
spent a lot of time ensuring my letters animate smoothly and consistently with the rectangles all remaining in a position relative to each other. I also experimented with different colors to see which would suit my font the best before finally deciding on fold.

My main challenge in creating this alphabet were creating letters which usually consist of angles such as X and Y, when it came to creating these letters I opted for a more abstract approach using my arrangement of rectangles to resemble these letter-forms. The three thinner rectangles have a consistent spacing in order to achieve consistency and legibility throught the alphabet (for example; the top line spacing of M is the same as W, creating a universal language for my letter-forms).

Another challenge I had was ensuring each letter and number looked different from each other, such as 8 and B and O and 0. To overcome this challenge I implemented the use of my thinner rectangles, using their spacing to change up my letter forms (for example; 8 has more negative upper spacing than B).

I have also put time into refining my code to make it more readable and clearly labelling each section of code, as well as naming variables appropriately. I have also added a few parameters, to make a total of nine. 

To further improve upon my code I have added a "rectWithShadow" function which adds a shadow to the letters, giving them a three-dimensional look. This allows for the letter forms to look more like geometric blocks, which gives them more of the Ancient Mayan feeling I was aiming for in the conception of my font.

My nine final parameters.

      * "lengthV1": The length of the first vertical rect.
      * "lengthV2": The length of the second vertical rect.
      * "offsetxV1": x offset of the first vertical rect.
      * "offsetxV2": x offset of the second vertical rect.
      * "offsetyH1": y offset of the first horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyH2": y offset of the second horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyH3": y offset of the third horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyV1" y offset of the first vertical rect.  
      * "offsetyV2" y offset of the second vertical rect.
