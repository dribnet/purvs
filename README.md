## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

More Iterating

Two updates: 
1. have added a third mask. This is currently just being used for my second image which involves transparency, I added this mask so that the background spacing and size is reflected within the beer bottle in which you can see it through
2. made the size of my background squares increase the with the y value, so they gradually get bigger vertically. Using this to try and create a more dynamic style of background, will continue to develop on this idea.
