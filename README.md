## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Stress continuum.

Just some tweaking to the design. I've chosen rotated rounded squares for the background to give it a soft but out of focus feeling, like you can't quite level your eyes on it, and have made use of the render counter to get the stress section to really spill out of it's bounds. I'm not totally sold on this, to be honest. The stress bit needs to be sharper, somehow, and I feel like there should be more to it. Currently it just feels a bit...bland.
