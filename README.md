## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My custom pixel is made up of a gridded circle layout where there is a mask with multiple different layers of a greyscale colour that is picked up by the sketch code. If the colour is within the set range it draws the circle on the grid at a different size, creating a scaling effect.

I added an offset to see what it would like.
After doing some research ive decided to go towards a roy lichtenstein art style for my finale image.
