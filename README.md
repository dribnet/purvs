## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The 3 images I have used are:
1 - A photo I have taken of my little brother at lorenzen bay, Raglan.
2 - Sunset at Ngarunui beach, Raglan.
3 - Power lines in central park, Brooklyn.

For my images I will focus on using patterns/shapes created in the masking process to add an interesting element to picture.

Have started working on my first image now. after playing around with some patterns/shapes I think I will use the silhouette of the subject in the photo instead of just a pattern or shape.
