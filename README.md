## PS4 MDDN 342 2018
For this project, I still want to keep the similar idea with my project 3 (http://www.purview.nz/versions/a6a66e9046c557d66e9b3b8c996a114d.html ). I only removed the line between the water wave because I think it is not important for this project and I also think it will resemble water better without it. 

I tried to base my idea on my initial sketch of this project, however, during coding process, some of the details were needed to be changed. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the final result of this project. 

I implimented as many animation as possible in the project and the details for them are:

1. Zoom 0: The whole canvas is filled with the wallpaper animation that similar to my Project 3 and the animation is based on globalFrameCount() and sin() to animate the water back and forward.

2. Zoom 1: Still the same animation but closer view

3. Zoom 2: The first animation stop and the fishes were added for this layer. The fishes are also coded the same way with globalFrameCount() and sin(). Also, the fish was drawn using function to add even more of them in the future but for now only 2 each grid because of the framerate can be annoying.

4. Zoom 3: This is the last zoom and it has the most details. This one everything from all of the previous layers and more details of the water wave plus bubbles. The bubble animation was implimented by the getRandomValue() for random movement. For the water waves, I only put the color animation in and the animation once again using sin().
