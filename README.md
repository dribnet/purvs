Alphangl

In my final development of my coded font I changed up the font ever so slightly. Making some adjustments as some of the letters needed to be a little more obvious. I also obviously added the exhibition but no need to make that a seperate git upload. I added A-Z, 0-9, and .!? into the swap words so everything should be shown at least once. Other than that I just made a few comments here and there in my code and fixed my Sketch.

To summarize my project I would say I am quite happy with the font. Possibly more abstract than I originally intended, however I was naive to think that all the letters would be as simple as ABC were. However I think I found ways around my issuesusing the layering provided by the Alpha Opacity I put in the project to make it look nicer. It turned out to be a god send and helped me define not only areas which need to be highlighted but also used to indicate where the negative space should exist in the over lapping triangles. 

I have dubbed the font Alphangl, it's root words being (Alpha[As in the Opacity drop essential for the project]/Alphabet, and Triangle). However I removed the E from the Triangle part because of the 8 letter constraint. 

Over all I think the font is fairly successful in terms of a coded font. The transitions a linear but still look good, and the letter mostly legible. There are a few which take a while to recognise. I do recognise that the was a little more trial and error in the making of the fonts however. Most of the fon't were made by guessing the coordinates and checking the results after I had come up with a basic shape. Furthermore I used all 12 parameters making this a lengthy process and the point of the parameters is to be able to work more efficiantly, so I only really half achieved that. However I believe that the font is a good combination of my conceptual ideas, a font and the code used to make it so I am happy with it.
