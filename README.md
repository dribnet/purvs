## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2


Did some subtle changes to my code to make it perfect. I changed the yellow to be more vibrant and made the opacity of the lemon lower. I feel like this really helped my letters be more understandable. I also changed the detail of the rind, made it more yellow. Now i just have to touch up my code and make it all neat!!
