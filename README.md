### Coded Clock	

At this point in the project, I have kept with a very standard looking clock. I need to find a way to make it more visually appealing. My last itteration used circles, but this one goes back to arrows. I want to incorporate element of both, but i want them to stand out. I will work on this before the hand in date.
