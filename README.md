At the beginning of this project chose to use Princess Leia's face but as I got into part two I realised that it would be more interesting to do Yoda. I felt that it'll be easier to add different variables to his face. 

The variables I chose to include are wrinkles (the whole face in general not just the forehead), amount of hair, hair color (light/dark), face color (light/dark), eye color. 

I chose to pick images of older people to fit the variables. Some wrinkles don't seem to work as they appear on young children. In the future I would make the gap between having no wrinkles and having wrinkles smaller. This could be done by not making it a discreet value and instead make the line widen the older the person is.
