I based my concept on vintage maps and charts that document the sun and moons movements. 

I animated and designed the circles so that they would travel outwards with each passing millisecond, second, minute and hour. 

I plan to add more visual detail and the alarm mode, as well as rules and markers to give a numerical indication.

### Outrageous clock

Describe the idea for your clock here - replacing this text.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your 
image above. You can also include
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
