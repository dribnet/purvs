I have added variables which include wrinkles, hair, hair colour and face colour. As the face colour goes darker, the stroke for most of the facial features seem to disappear so therefore I have made them grey instead. 

Phoebe suggested to put pictures of old men for Yoda's face to be mapped onto. I think this is a good idea as the features I made into variables could work nicely.
