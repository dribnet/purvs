## Assignment 1 - MDDN 242 - Creative Coding II 2018

### Super Clock Land

---

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time. Adhering roughly to the capabilities of the Super Game Boy, an add-on peripheral for the Super Nintendo.

---

#### Changes:
+ Fixed a bunch of little inconsistencies including the erroneous palette information in the middle of the island
+ Made the alarm more alarming
+ Tidied up waterfall stuff

#### Current Issues:

+ 

#### To Do:

+ Get some sleep

#### Notes:
+ I Elected not to add clouds or an underside to the island due to how they obscure the more interesting parts of the scene
+ There's some weird inconsistency in behavior between browsers and even different computers. I don't think I can do much about that one
+ Ocean does not use palette swapping scheme, though *technically* is still within the limitations of the SGB. That per-pixel function was never really used in any commercial game
