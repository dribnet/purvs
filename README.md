In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have decided to use 3 lines to make each letter that stays within the circles. I wanted my design to be very simple and clean looking. I have a lot of ideas, to use arcs, circles, triangles, but i decided to stick with this idea because it stood out to me the most and looked the nicest. 

I will be using all 12 parameters per letter,

The three parameters per letter are now:

LINE 1:
 xval1 
 xval2 
 xval3 
 xval4 


LINE 2:
 yval1 
 yval2 
 yval3 
yval4 

LINE 3:
 zval1 
 zval2 
 zval3 
 zval4
