## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

I've added some more letters and played around with the colour. I made the transparency different for the big circle and the two smaller ones so that the smaller ones stand out more.

The line is no longer the colour of the background, but instead a cream colour. This is the same for the big circle outline, cream matches better with the brown. 


The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
