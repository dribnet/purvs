### Bouncing Blocks

Having changed my idea slighty so that a block falls at each time (each second/minute/hour etc) so that each block will bounce down the surface.

Replaced the smooth ground plane with stairs to better match my idea as well as creating an interesting relationship between the ground and blocks.
