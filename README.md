## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters contains circles and arcs. The arc size and position is fixed, but the angle is affected by parameters. The circles can change in size and position.

The parameters in my program are:
  * `size` : radius of the circles
  * `offset1x` : x offset of the first circle relative to the arc
  * `offset1y` : y offset of the first circle relative to the arc
  * `offset2x` : x offset of the second circle relative to the arc
  * `offset2y` : y offset of the second circle relative to the arc
  * `arcStart` : starting angle of the arc (degrees)
  * `arcEnd` : ending angle of the arc (degrees)

  At this point my program uses 7 parameters.
