## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I've been unsure if my code has been working in my commits because I work on a different folder and then port my code over into ps4 folder without testing on the local server.

Iteration:

Iterations with another image, i've decided for progress I will keep this format as my algorithm that i'm applying is generative and  changing the parameter on my strokeweight/rendering time of the image change the output drastically each image will look similar but be 'one of a kind.'

In this image I found a snapper card that was dropped into shallow water. The light created some interesting rainbow colours on the rocks and the current of the water made the rock/card and colours distorted looking. I mainly chose this image because of the colours are really pleasing for me.

The parameters for these images are similar to the last commit except the rendering times were different and this time I was using different masks. For my masks I was trying to track the rainbow colours so that they would render those colours over the colours of the rock. I want to try create a mask that looks like the 1st images surrounding of the card and the 2nd images, render of the card.
