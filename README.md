## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I am currently taking Typography, where I've been researching how geometric shapes make up letter forms and today I felt inspired to create my letter forms from geometric shapes in p5.js

My colour scheme is inspired by pop art colours.

Most of my parameters include:
- The size of shape
- Width of the shape
- Height of the shape
- Multiple x positions
- Multiple y positions

23/03 - Took me a while to understand the different ways of declaring parameters, calling them and calling the functions.

Homework: I am going to further brainstorm my idea and build on it + work on my sketch.
