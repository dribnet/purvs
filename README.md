## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

The nine parameters per letter:

- size2: the size of the circle
- X2: the x position of the circle
- Y2: the y position of the circle 
- start2 : angle to start the circle
- end2: angle to end the circle 
- rectX: x position of the rectangle 
- rectY: y position of the rectangle 
- rectH: height of the rectangle 
- rectW: width of the rectangle 

  First tutorial for PS2. Getting used to using github desktop and changing files. Made a simple design using arcs as a basis for my design. Also uploaded a variety of different sketch ideas.


  My idea is inspired by bauhaus typography. I looked at the shapes used which include arcs, triangles, and squares. Each letter is made up of 2 arc's, each arc can be altered by position, size and degrees for the amount of rotation of them. So far i have 8 parameters. I could try make the first yellow arc at a fixed position in order to get less parameters. At some point I will try and change the 2nd arc into a triangle. I updated my draw_letters.js and letters.js from sketch.js.

  Further workings on my type include adjusting the colours back to the original idea based on the primary colours from the Bauhaus period. I have made up to the letter L during class today. I am trying to make the font readable but also fun with the colours. Some of the letter such as E and J have been super hard to draw in capital letters. I want to further my designs I think by making them slightly more abstract just due to the Bauhaus style.
