Have cleaned up some of the positions of the rectangles. Also have gotten the interpolation working for the interaction and exibition.

The 12 parameters per letter:

  "lineX" - x and y coordinate for first point of the first line
  "lineY" - " "
  "lineXX" - x and y coordinate for second point of the first line
  "lineYY" - " "

  "lineX2" - x and y coordinate for first point of the second line
  "lineY2" - " "
  "lineXX2" - x and y coordinate for second point of the second line
  "lineYY2"

  "offsetx" - x and y coordinate for first small rect
  "offsety" - " "

  "offsetx2" - x and y coordinate for second small rect
  "offsety2" - " "
