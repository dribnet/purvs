## Powers of 10 PRINT

I am trying to get my webbed, curved pattern, building upon the fence code to try and create ellipses of interest that zoom into more detail, while the ropes inbetween make it more of a web.

I have made some curves to work with this isdea, however I have moved slightly from my initial idea to make this slightly underwater feel, mainly due to the colours and flowing curves, as well as particles that appear as you soom in.

With this zooming in, I just want to add more detail the further you zoom in. This will make it exciting to push further into the map. I will need to work more on creating places of interest however.
