### Moon and Sun clock

The clock has the sun and the moon moving in a circle as the hours go by. A full circle is 24 hours. 
The background changes depending on the time of day (At midnight it's black while at dawn it's orange and at noon it's blue).

The position of the sun and the moon represents the time (for example the moon is at the top at midnight and the sun is at the top at noon).

When the alarm is set you see the phases of the moon and when it goes off you see the sun rays.
The clouds now fade in and out and I made the time in the middle slighty transparent.
