## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Version with opposite map for middle fill

Turns out it was an easy fix for the numbers not having the right colour while interpolating, I forgot to add its map to interpolate_letter.

I added another line which follows the original to split up the line into two.
This makes the letters more interesting rather than being a single line being drawn.


Letters I don't like:
H - Needs a third wave but want to stick with just having 2 lines
I - same with H
U,V - very similar
Z - short bottom

Todo:
Make it more interesting, adding decoration?.
Fix colours for the numbers.
