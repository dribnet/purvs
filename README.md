In this commit, I've begun to work out how the coordinate system works and implemented my brick wall pattern into it. I need to clean up the function into a for loop so that it creates draws the brick wall with way less lines of code but I wanted to do it manually to make sure everything was working fine!

I also added a window function with a window sill that stays in proportion throughout the zooms. I added a moon that you can see when you zoom up closer to the window. I would like to add clouds that float (ambient animation) with randomness incorporated into it ?
