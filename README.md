## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The 3 images I have used are:
1 - A photo I have taken of my little brother at lorenzen bay, Raglan.
2 - Sunset at Ngarunui beach, Raglan.
3 - Top of my house.

For my images I have focused on abstracting the image by duplicating the silhouette of the subjuct in the photo (done in the masking process) to create a cool and interesting effect which creates a constant flow and brings all the images together when looked at on the whole.

Have slightly changed my idea from random shapes to duplicating the subjact. Have also changed my 3d photograph because the one before it was simply not working with my code.
