## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel : Trixle Pixel

I have decided to change the theme last second since I didn't like it a lot so I thought about something a little bit more relevant to me which is why I decided to do some consoles/games, mainly the ds. I chose this theme since its been a big factor in my life. I loved to play games with others, which is generally how I started conversations and found friends in primary and in high school. I decided to do something to try and show the connection between all 3 of the images just using the code to some extent. It is nothing amazing but I just added a white mask in between the 3 images so they all connected when they are shown all together.

Changes are just the background. Instead of 2 ellipses, I changed one of them in to a rect function since I think it looks better with the dark background. Played around with the sizes a bit, but nothing too drastic of a change. Added a few comments and such.

Changed the images that are a bit clearer with the pixels.
