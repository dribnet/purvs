## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

image 2 progress
with all the help from my teacher and TAs, I gain a deeper understanding of the perspective and I employed the camera() function to explore more possibilities. Then, I have found the better angle to show.

For next step, I will bring my own version to image 1 and also finsh my image 3.
<!-- work on my style
Finally, I built a consistent style of series. I took this sort of shots from the different spots. When I employ my concept to these photos, I can show a specific sense of dimension. The viewers could feel something come out, fade away, pass by.

There is sort of challenges at this stage:
1. background texture( have to learn how to create 3d texture, like 3d supershapes or noise.
2. When I transfer my code to the class system, something always has been changed. I have to work it out the rule of it.
3. viewpoint control
4. how to calculate the angle of rotation on X, Y, Z axis.

<!-- smart mask
My story setting and smart mask
It's an amazing system to make a mask of a wide range of objects. Also, I finally select my series of images. To ensure express my consistent style explicitly, I choose the image from the different angles to view the object, upward view, vertical view, side view to make sure the 3d visual effect stand out.

For next step, I will refine the details of the shapes and adjust the perspective to fulfil my intention. -->


<!-- progress

I was inspired by the work form processing. The initial idea is if I transfer the whole thing to the Z axis and I may find a specific angle to give a sense of 3d to viewers.
I referenced Isometric projection, An isometric view of an object can be obtained by choosing the viewing direction such that the angles between the projections of the x, y, and z-axes are all the same. It points out the mathematics method how to calculate the rotation angle.

I push my experiment from 2d to 3d, that's the key point of my plan. I adjust the height of the part of mask. I have done some research about how to control the camera viewpoint ortho(). I am still working on this part though.

<!-- The start

I spent about two weeks to explore the field of image processing both in p5js and processing. After I gained deeper understanding of it, I was going to think about custom pixels.

The first step is how to locate each pixel in the image. Definitely, there is a way offered in the example file. I also have learned another way to locate the pixel in image.

Then, I roughly create different shapes for the pixels to take a glance of the visual effect.

By the way, I was thinking of the animation effect for this project. I am betting that would be cool. surely, in this case, I have tried sorts of methods to figure it out.
