## PS4

For my final layer of progress I tried very hard to get an additional layer of detail with spaceships flying around, to show an abstract idea of flight paths or something similar. However I ran into the clipping issue again and it was a very big downside this time around. The clipping would cut my spaceships and throw the pieces in very weird locations. I spent a long time trying to fix this but with no success. 

Due to time constraints I switched the final layer of detail to a sort of information pop up that appears when you zoom in to stars. Some stars might not have any, but others can have up to four at a time. This is another feature that I think works well enough to make each star more unique and interesting. 

There is a portion of stroke weight enhancing with zoom, and alternate stroke and fill colours to again, make the information pop up seem more unique.
