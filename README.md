## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

### 29/03/22 - FIRST ABC

In today's class, I worked on the first part of the project, creating an A, B and C letterform.

I have based my letters off the Mondrian art style, which uses squares, rectangles and lines in primary colours to create abstract artwork. Each letter has a red square, a blue rectangle and a black line in varying sizes and orientations. I have made 11 variables for each my letters, encompassing the size, orientation and position of each element of the letter. I could probably refine this and so that some of the variables rely on each other or are more constant, but for now I am just getting a feel for the project and the code framework.

The 11 parameters per letter:
  * `squareX` : x offset of the red square
  * `squareY` : y offset of the red square
  * `squareSize` : the length of the sides of the red square
  * `rectX` : x offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectY` : y offset of the blue rectangle
  * `rectWidth` : width of the blue rectangle
  * `rectHeight` : height of the blue rectangle
  * `lineX` : x offset of the start point of the line
  * `lineY` : y offset of the start point of the line
  * `lineLength` : length of the line
  * `lineAngle` : orientation of the line (either vertical or horizontal)

I am not sure yet if this will be the idea I continue with for the rest of the project but I think it could look really cool. I could add more shapes to it or add in some yellow to create more variation in the letters. I will have to do some more research into the Mondrian art style.
