This is a system where characters are drawn by the motion of 1-pixel particles tracing a path between
four points that they approach in sequence.

###Changes:
- Totally forgot to commit my code to git until now because I haven't been doing anything interesting to look at

###Issues:
- Currently nothing much to look at
- Class variables are currently a bit of a mess
- Lots of tidy-up needs doing

###To-Do:
- Commit to git more often! I've been bad about it
- Get my particle systems drawing on-screen
