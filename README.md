### Coded Clock	

This is the final itteration of my clock. I attempted to do my initial fan idea, but ended up going from circular motions and shapes to a more traditional shape that i favoured over the fan for the simplicity. I wanted the time on my clocks to be readable very quickly, but i also wanted to have other elements to look at. My designs are simplistic.
