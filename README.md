### Outrageous clock
So I wanted to make a wacky skin for a clock.
I like the idea of having this clock on a tv in the corner of the room, watching you with big The Great Gatsby eyes. 
The center of the eyes would have the hour in them, and then the amount of eyelashes would indicate what the minute of the hour was. I also like the idea of it blinking every 30 seconds or so. Maybe I could also incorprate the moving of the eyes, but I don't want them to follow the mouse because thats overdone. I also like the idea of having this set up and not having to interact with it. 

I will see how this code goes, and if i get inspired my idea will change. That said I think this should doable within the scope of the course.
