## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

I completed the entire alphabet but still have yet to do the numbers. Sorry for the long description but I thought I would talk about the thought process behind the current letterforms:  

* a,b,d,p,q
...are all based off of each other and the shapes easily came together in a pleasing way. 

* c,e,o,s,x
...are all similar and based off the starting letter c. these forms were more challenging in terms of designing them for maximum readibility given the constraints of my letterform system. the letter 'x' was especially challenging but the reasoning for its current design is that I've determined that a defining feature of the letter 'x' is it's intersection which I've tried to communicate with the two rectangles intersecting each other in the center.

* t was based on f but to differentiate it, I've made the circle for the 't' bigger and at the bottom to further communicate the slope of the 't'.

* y is a rip-off of g. these forms are unique because their shape components have no overlapping qualities like the other letters. 

* j,k,l was based off of i. all these letters posed a challenge that required some outside of the box thinking and numerous iterations. 

* m and n was inspired by h. the 'm' was challenging because of its two curves. although it is not entirely readable in itself, i settled on its current iteration and also, the 'w' was based off of it. the circle on the 'm' is aligned to the top of the form while, it is aligned at the bottom for the 'w'. 

* from 'w', 'u' and 'v' were formed. these forms are very similar to each other and it doesn't help that they are placed right beside one another. the 'u' and 'v' were challending to differentiate but I decided that the sharpness of the 'v' is important to communicate to distinguish it from the roundedness of 'u.

so far, i've tested out some words w/ friends and they were able to read their names, "stupid", "jealousy" and "lemonade" but, "excited" was very challenging to decipher.
