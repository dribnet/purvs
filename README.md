## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

My letters are made up of 4 lines. The first point is set on each letter and parameters make up the other points. each letter can be made from these 4 lines and if the letter only requires 3 lines, then the fourth is used as a decoration.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `point1X` : X offset of the first point
  * `point1Y` : Y offset of the first point
  * `point2X` : X offset of the second point
  * `point2Y` : Y offset of the second point
  * `point3X` : X offset of the third point
  * `point3Y` : Y offset of the third point   
  * `point4X` : X offset of the fourth point
  * `point4Y` : Y offset of the fourth point
  * `point5X` : X offset of the fifth point
  * `point5Y` : Y offset of the fifth point
  * `point6X` : X offset of the sixth point
  * `point6Y` : Y offset of the sixth point

=======
In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
