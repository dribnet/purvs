## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

I initially struggled to think of ways I could successfully use the focused aspect of the random function, because many of my parameterised values had small ranges and the possibilities in that small range allowed for many expression changes.  To preserve the emotion variance, I looked more towards what aspects would be useful for each face to have similarities with. I ended up going with both the ears and the jawline. 

My reasoning for this is that if someone were to look at my group of faces, and half of the characters had very sharp ears pointing straight into the sky, they may not pick up that my faces are based off of supreme kai’s (As the ear shapes are quite an identifiable point between them). A similar logic was applied for the jawline as well. When the jawline spreads too far it gives off more of a box face shape, and loses the anime/ dragon ball type appearance to it. 

I also used the percentage based return of the discrete values on the earrings. 80% of the time the face’s will have both earrings, while having a 10% chance of having a single earring on the left, and another 10% chance of having one on the right. Earrings are also an identifiable point of supreme kai’s and they almost always have both on at once, so I thought it would be fitting to use the distribution like this.
