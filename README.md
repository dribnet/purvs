For a theme, all my photos are of personal memorabilia, and I like the idea of giving the objects this blurry asthetic, as if it's being imagined.

Teddy bear from childhood.
Camera from Granddad.

The 3rd image I'm not completely sure about, but the FirstAidKit was from my Mum. She put it together for me to bring to Wellington, but also for many years when I was younger, my siblings and I were apart of "St John's Cadets".

So all these objects are related to my past, and I think the way I've rendered the first 2 photos so far, through a bit of a blurry look, capture that memory asthetic.
