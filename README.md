## Powers of 10 PRINT

I have started again using the fence 2 code which helped a lot as I know how it works now. So I have made three levels; the grid, red and black dot pattern and have added a square in within the black dots. 

I initially wanted to make two grids for the dot pattern and rotate one but this didn't seem to work the way I wanted it to. So I decided to draw two grids, keep one as a normal grid and move each individual dot from the other grid to 'rotate' it. 

I'm happy with the second layer but I still need to add more detail to the first and third layer.
