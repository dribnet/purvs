## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Originally for this project I wanted to create a retro / geometric inspired alphabet, however after some sketching I found that this idea didn't come out with my desired result. While I am still sticking with a retro theme, I'm shifting my inspiration towards the font of old video games with a pixel art staticky feel. I want to be able to create the illusion of movement with this alphabet even though it is still a static image, hence the blue and red colour splitting and slight blur effect of CRT monitors. The shapes of the letters are very pixelated and blocky which also takes reference from this design style. While the shapes this alphabet is composed of are relatively simple, effective colour and illusion of movement, as well as having an overall sense of cohesiveness and nostalgia will be the main goal.

Currently I am in the middle of scaling down my pixels that make up the letters from 30x30 pixels to 15x15 pixels and shifting each letter 90 pixels down and 45 across since I originally drew them in a weird position. This shouldn't take too much longer to clean up.

Another thing I might play with a bit is the static effect on each letter and either adding more colours to it other than red and blue or making the static colours a bit bigger.

Each of my letters consists of 10 square pixels in a 5x5 square grid which can be altered by their x and y co-ordinates.

The twenty parameters per letter:
x1 = Pixel 1/10 x co-ordinate position
y1 = Pixel 1/10 y co-ordinate position

x2 = ''
y2 = ''

x3 = ''
y3 = ''

x4 = ''
y4 = ''

x5 = ''
y5 = ''

x6 = ''
y6 = ''

x7 = ''
y7 = ''

x8 = ''
y8 = ''

x9 = ''
y9 = ''

x10 = ''
y10 = ''
