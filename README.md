## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
I've got my three photos taken and theme decided. My theme is autumn, I took all three photos with my film camera of one of a friend surrounded by leaves, and autumn colours. With photos 2 & 3, I kept the same effect I had on my last commit, but just changed the masks in photoshop. However when I came to do the first photo last (random order I know), I had decided I wanted to have hearts as the pixel shape in the mask. The photos have a very 90's, cheesy, and wholesome feel to them, so I thought a heart shape would be fitting. I've created the heart in the sketch.js code and I love it's shape. However I have a little problem as you will see from output_1, the heart is taking over the whole image, I tried integrating it into the mask but it wasn't changing so I'm hopefully going to get some help from one of the tutors to get my mask functioning properly. Apart from that, I'm still trying to figure out what sort of masks I want to have on my photos, and am still getting my head around the code.
