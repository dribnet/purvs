## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

CHANGING TO A GRID STRUCTURE

I change to a grid format so it would be more structured, however whenever i wanted to add in my designs to the squares or even change the shape of the pixel when I wanted to save the output it would download like 300 files each one would add a new line to the grid, it seemed to be doing the whole process, not just the final output, I wasn't sure why it was doing that so I ended up deleting the code and re-watch the phoebes video on how to make the grid, once I remade it and add in my if and else statements its seemed to be working, I wasn't sure what I did wrong but I'm glad that I have it working now.
