My alphabet is named PEVERELL after the family in Harry Potter that were in the deathly hallows tale. I decided on this name as the deathly hallows is commonly associated with a triangle symbol.
For my exhiibition code I included a 8 letter word for each letter of the alhpabet to showcase each letter indiviually.

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have only made subtle changes to make my letters work. My intial idea was to use 3 triangles and change the colour to create more defined letters but that would have been to many parameters because most of my letters were using 12 parameters with just the 2 triangles. 


The twelve parameters per letter are now:
  *    These are the x and y cooridates of each point for the triangles,
  a - c being 1 triangle and 1 - 3 being the other.
  *    "pax": 
  *    "pay": 
  *    "pbx": 
  *    "pby": 
  *    "pcx": 
  *    "pcy": 
  *    "p1x": 
  *    "p1y": 
  *    "p2x": 
  *    "p2y": 
  *    "p3x": 
  *    "p3y":
