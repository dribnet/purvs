## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So for this update, I have mainly focused on optimization and cleaning up my code as opposed to changing the fundementals of the algorithm as I am pretty happy with it so far. So what I did was:
	- I added in a lot more comments which should make it a bit more readable
	- Focused on reducing the render time. I know that this isn't nessassary, but I thought that it would be a good thing to do as. This was done by primarily trying to reduce the amount of function calls required for the program to run, as well as reduce the amount of maths needed to be performed. All this as added up to a considerable gain in performance. 

Some things I may still do would involve tweaking the background. This would primarily involve tweaking the star sizes, the colours etc. I may add more symbols, like say the playstaion symbols, which would work well with the the darker background
