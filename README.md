## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Part 2: Theme

My Theme is based around friends, family and the outdoors/nature. At the beginning of this assignment I was experimenting with a lot of different reveal methods when drawing these images since it also been raining heavily recently I thought about using the effects of water to help me render these images. This also went along with my theme of the outdoors/nature.
