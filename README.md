(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Through a bit of trial and error im working out how to do my own letters by changing around the code provided. 
I have changed my idea a little bit to just iusing two triangles at most as this will allow me to change a max of 12 parameters through changing the six points of the two triangles. 
So far the most parameters i have had to change is 10 (by keeping the starting point the same this saves me 2 parameters.)
