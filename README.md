## PS4 Infinite LandScape Part 2

Got my landscape drawing infinitely with some noise going on, took a bit of playing around and had to steal some of the example code but its working. From here I want to start adding in more details to different zoom levels and add some more variety to the landscape in general (thinking biomes). I'll try and add some waters and trees next before moving onto mountains. Lag doesn't seem to be too bad at the moment, so I won't worry about that now, but will keep it in mind moving forward.
