MODIFIED VERSION TWO:

To futher modify the font, I redesigned the digits casuse I think the previous version is too abstract to understand.

[To modify the letters,I asked my classmates and roomates to read the words for testing the intelligibility of my font. Then i decided to change the letters that hard to recognize. I redesigned the "G","I","J",K",S","T" and "Z". And also, I adjusted the "c", "D", "U" and "X". I make effort to make my font understandable and express clear concept.At the same time, each of them should different from each other. ]


 The ten parameters per letter:

 size1 : radius of the first sector
 size : radius of the second sector
 offsetx1 : x offset of the first sector 
 offsety2 : y offset of the first sector 
 offsetx : x offset of the second sector 
 offsety : y offset of the second sector 
 aecS : start of the first sector
 aecE : end of the first sector
 aecS2 : start of the second sector
 aecE2 : end of the second sector
