## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today after design feedback I have made a few changes. In sticking true to my theme of natural beauty, I believe it would distract from the overall design if I was to use a solid colour to make the background pop more. I have opted to use the PIXmod however I have a few bug issues with it which I will fix before my next upload

I have also decided to change my middle image. I feel as much as I liked that image, it doesn't show off the pattern of the flower as much because they are all solid and less variation between the colours. I have found another image I took and I think I like this one a lot better. I think in the future I might move around image 2 and 3 because image 2 is the 'odd' one out as it only displays one type of flower
