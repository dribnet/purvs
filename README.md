## Final
My final code can be found in the file "example_framed_dot.js"

My final image draws on the tree motif from my last project. I have chosen to further the drawing look, but this time take it down the road of a sflat-colour cartoon. I have chosen to play with patterns as the zoom level increases. 

The image I created to showcase what I imagined myprogect looking like

My laptop is struggling to render these images, and won't go past a level 4 or 5 zoom, because of this it is really hard to set up and test the tour feature, in place of this I have added screenshots highlighting key areas.


Actual screenshots of key areas in case they don't show up properly on other computers

I have added multiple areas of interest. In the green section near the bottom grass becomes represented as the zoom level increases, at first as simple lines of green, and then as complex, symbolic rows of triangles.

I have taken the leaf motif and tied it intp the border of the image, using the leaf shapes to create a braided border at top and bottom when zoom is increased. 

I have also added detail to the leaves as zoom increases, adding some subtle lines to abstract the basicx leaves into a pattern. 
The tree leaves themselves I have decidd to leave all a single colour, however I have moved them about based on noise and created a more randomised, varied population of leaves.
