## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Experimenting with input 2
This is an iteration I got to after about four versions of experimenting with code, specifically shapes, size, and pixels. The reason why I didn't upload the previous iterations was because in this project particularly it's hard to determine a significant change without gettig distracted and hencefore unintentionally continuing without documenting the significant changes. Nonetheless I have come to a point in the project where i have reach a point where I am happy with the design and output of this photograph and intend on implementing a similar design and output on my other two photos.
