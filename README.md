## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

First attempt. Used a picture of friends and my cat to try and see how it works. I have found accedently that my pictures have an outline almost which I find quite interesting and want to try and potentially develop further later on in the project.

At the moment I have played around with shaped and have tried to take insiration from Low Poly Art to make my images. I have made some progress and am quite happy with it at this stage. I want to try using different shapes or polygons. Also trying to implement a randomness to it with regards to size or shape if I get that working. If i can I want to map the shapes to the fill/colour but dont know how well that woul work or how to do it.

WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH TRYING AND USING A VERY GOOD CLEAR IMAGE THAT HAS A MASK FROM A DIFFEENT IMAGE AND PLAYING AROUND TO SEE THE EFFECT THIS HAS. OR EVEN TWO DIFFERNET MASKS MAYBE? - COLOUR AND SHAPE?
