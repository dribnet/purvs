Final

My final parameterised map is exploring how the use of ellipses and opacity can make unique patterns and shapes. I used problem set 3 as inspiration for this project, and while my final turned out quite different from my sketch, the overall concepts didn’t differ much.

I began by bringing over the most simple circle arrangement from my previous project and continued to experiment with the complexity as I added the zoom levels. It was when I changed the background from white to black that I felt the aesthetic really started to come together. 

I have used a pulsing animation in the map, both randomised and not randomised. I chose this animation as it highlights the unique forms being created and loosely replicates a breathing motion – an idea continued from problem set 3.

The overall map is quite abstract and can be interpreted in many ways, which I like. While the only shape used is ellipses, I think I managed to add complexity through the composition, size and animation of them. 

While the code was a challenge, I was able to learn from this new framework and am happy with the final outcome!
