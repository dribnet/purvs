## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In this version i created a function called spider to generate lines from the random xy point. I'm aiming to make the function create 
a similar look to what the lines on the skin/face look like but showing a little more detail.

I also set up my code to do a second pass after doing the background and body it does the face so that that will always be in the front.

After playing around with the lines a bit i have decided i am going to try and make the skin of the subject render as 
the scratchy lines, the body and hair will be a smoother pixel maybe using elipses or shorter lines and the background
will be made of triangles another polygon to give off a shattered looks
