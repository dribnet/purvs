### Clock Example

This is my clock idea, I took the idea of the water clock and abstracted it into my interpretation of a water clock. The idea is for the taps to "drip" after there respective time measurements have passed(seconds, minutes, hours) with each tap representing its own time frame, after the time reaches the point it can continue in its sequence (e.g minutes going upto 59 will change to 1 therefore wont continue the pattern) the water balloon will pop and a new one will replace and it will start again.
