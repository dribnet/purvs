## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Today, with the help of Phoebe, I am now able to have different layers of mask, I also think it could be interesting to see if I could use a draw function to either draw a shape resebling a leaf or a flower. I will develop this idea further and see where it takes me.

Also I am having trouble with the draw leaf function. The random function isn't as controled and the red dots are appear on other parts of the background. Not too hard to fix just annoying more than anything!

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
