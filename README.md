## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I changed the inner circles to arcs and using some extra parameters. I added some more parameters to control: Size X and Y, the arc angles for ArcX and ArcY. With the size parameters I am able to size and stretch the arcs how I please. With the arc angle parameters I am able to changle where the arc starts and begins in degrees, this means I able to sort of rotate the arcs like I did with my letter "C".
