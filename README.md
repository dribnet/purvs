This is my preliminary idea for my alphabet. It is based off two types of triangles- one with two thick sides and one thin, and one with one thick side and two thin. There will be 2 of each triangle availible to be used or hidden to creat each letter. Every letter consits of 1-3 triangles and is made up of a combination of the two triangle types.
