Updated code so the letters animate! I've added my parameters into the interaction.js file and sucessfully animated my letters. Because my letters are quite simple, the standard animation works quite well for it. I need to create my numbers, then I will work on the exhibition section.




So far my parameters include:
  "size"    = hieght of ellipse
  "sizeW"   = width of ellipse 
  "offsetx" = x position offset from origin
  "offsety" = y position offset from origin
  "rectL"   = length of rectangle
  "rectW"   = height of rectangle
  "radi"    = radius of rectangle corners
  "ellPosx" = x position of the ellipse
  "ellPosy" = y position of the ellipse
