Episode 06

To further make the transitions more smoother, i fixed up the letters.js by adding a full line of the const variables for each of the moving rect/ellipse/rotation.

by adding all these values to their respective letter const, i can get a smoother transition by hiding as well as merging the shapes when not needed into the background. The resulting change made for an interesting interpolation of letter changes.

using the reference as shown:
      "pos_x1": 0,
      "pos_y1":0,
      "width_1":0,
      "height_1":0,

      "pos_x2": 0,
      "pos_y2": 0,
      "width_2":0,
      "height_2":0,

      "pos_x3": 0,
      "pos_y3": 0,
      "width_3":0,
      "height_3":0,

      "pos_x4": 0,
      "pos_y4": 0,
      "width_4":0,
      "height_4":0,

      "c_posx": 0,
      "c_posy": 0,
      "c_width": 0,
      "c_height": 0,

      "r_letter": 0
