## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
 
My final theme is/represents the interdimensional world between the digital world and the naturistic world. I have taken three wholesome, autumnal photographs and remixed them with highly stylized, fluorescent colours and rotated shapes with funky patterns to imagine what a crazy dimension like this could look like right at its core. It’s a very abstract idea, and was not my initial plan, but through my experimentation process this is what it has become. I see it perfect for a billboard, as it catches your attention immediately, the three images have so many elements to look at, to question and interpret as your own.

At the heart of each image is a girl who’s figure you can just see made from shapes and in two of the images digitised colours, the nature surrounding her is peaking through rectangular pixels that have been rotated to convey a sense of motion. Each image has a colour theme that makes up ‘RGB’, the first being an electric blue, the second being both a neon green and a calm khaki green, and thirdly a warm mix of reds. The effect that each colour has, being spurted into different shades that align with the tones of the original images, is what makes them so spectacular. The girl’s skin tone, and lighter colours on the body convert to much lighter versions of their RGB colour, then the darker colours become more bold. There was no real outside inspiration for how I intended my images to look, it was all just my imagination going a little wild and trying to think outside the box to create an array of capturing billboard images. It is almost as if they have a very ‘random’ element to them, when in fact they are pretty much the complete opposite. Each one carefully considered, with lots of time. I have tried and tested almost every pattern, size, shade, and rotation imaginable. This project has consisted of a whole lot of trial and error. The most difficult part was really just developing my theme, and taking time to test different code, rotations, colours, etc. It’s interesting to compare this to project two where I had my idea from the start and didn’t vary too far from it, but here I have done the complete opposite. Though, I am still very pleased with the result, and am excited to see how it looks plastered on a billboard!
