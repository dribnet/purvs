## Powers of 10 PRINT

I am trying to get my web pattern, building upon the fence code to try and create ellipse of interest that zoom into more detail while the ropes inbetween make it more of a web.

I am struggling to get the curves into the flows from the ellipses at this stage but have developed this further from the last commit. It is beginning to take on an element of underwater inspiration, through the colours and things floating through the water, like bubbles and seaweed.
