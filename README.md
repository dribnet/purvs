## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Further Refinements of Background Details

I have adjusted the grid code so that it is more consistent, as the old code didn't fully work with the third image of the ivy. I've adjusted the colours of the lines and circles to make certain elements stand out. I like how this grid detail made my images look brighter and livelier like its been hit by the sun. I might play around with the background details more to see if I can find better outcomes.
