## Powers of 10 PRINT

I started doing just the bases of 3 zoom layers. 
The first one is a grid and I'm planning to make each square be either yellow, red or grey. This will be randomly chosen.  

The second zoom layer will have ellipses and the third layer will be inside one of the ellipses.

I have noticed when zooming in a grid layout it won't zoom closer, it stays the same. But zooming into the single dot, it works. I'm not sure why that is.
