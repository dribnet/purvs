FLIPPY INTERPOLATION
In an earlier version of my font I wasn't paying attention to using each point in the parameters consistently, so I ended up with an animation that has the triangles flip and mirror a bit awkwardly during the interpolation.
You'll see in my final commit that the interpolation between the animations is smoother and doesn't have the triangles cross over one another, however I simply wanted to show off this style of interpolate because it was a route I considered sticking with but ultimately moved on from it.
