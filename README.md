### Test Clock

A clock that uses extruding and retreating panels to show the passage of time. The three concentric circles of the clock represent hours, minutes, and seconds.
Moving the mouse horizontally will orbit your view of the clock.
Clicking on the clock will activate the alarm sequence, which will 'sound' 20 seconds later by extruding the clock to a huge degree.
