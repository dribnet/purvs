## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Animation
   
This time round I played around some more with the rotation making it more random and fast. When you type different letters this time it rotates but it is much faster. It ends up creating the letters quite dramatically. With letters that are heavy on rotation it makes it fly off the screen for some and then come flying back really fast. It's amusing to see but also really disorientating. I like how it rotates however I don't think it is very practical, as it flashes around if you type. I think that maybe slowing it down would be better or decreasing the amount it flies. Although I like how it way over shoots and come snapping back like a magnet. It looks as if it is being pulled apart and it gets excited and flies around but get pull straight back to the out arc to form the next letter. Maybe adding some colour into the animation would be interesting as currently it is plain black which I like. But it seems too plain so maybe adding some colour would be interesting like if once it gets to a certain point it changes colour then it changes back perhaps that would be interesting. 
Looking more at the animation at some letters then outer arc would move slightly then come back but in other cases it would fly out of the screen in a circle and then fly back in. When typing the letters it's interesting to see move subtly but then the next letter it would be fast and gone. I found that no matter how far it flies it will always fly in a circle shape which is interesting. I think I will use that circle idea but I'm not too sure about how fast it flies. 
The outer arc flies within the screen and in a much smaller rotation, however the smaller inner arc flies in a much bigger arc which is a contrast that I find interesting, but not too big on it. I think I will continue to play around and test out colour and see if it will work out. I'm not sure how to make the colour but maybe adding some variables would work.



pos2x this draws the x position of the first point 
pos2y this draws the y position of the first point 
pos3x this draws the x position of the second point 
pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
rotatearc2 this rotates the outer arc
rotatearc3 this rotates the inner arc
