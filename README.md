Part 3: Interpolation

 During the creation of my alphabet I continuosly considered how each line would move so that this interpolation stage was pretty much finished for me. I think the idea of using all 4 lines and colours helped make the letter changes more seemless if compared to some lines not used. I'm happy with how the characters moved from another. I especially liked how the characters X, K, J, S, and U changed from different characters. I'm glad that I thought about the values for X and Y axis during the process of creating the characters, giving me a rough idea in how they can change to a different character - which also helped finish this interpolation part of the project at the same time.

 I have also changed the background colour to a pale baby blue as it helped add a tint to the background. I tried other colours such as black and mid blue for the background but they muted the colours of the characters, thats why I decided to choose a light background colour.

    "lineX1": X axis for line 1
    "lineY1": Y axis for line 1

    "lineX3": X axis for line 3
    "lineY3": Y axis for line 3
    "lineX4": X axis for line 4
    "lineY4": Y axis for line 4
    "lineX5": X axis for line 5
    "lineY5": Y axis for line 5
    "lineX6": X axis for line 6
    "lineY6": Y axis for line 6
    "lineX7": X axis for line 7
    "lineY7": Y axis for line 7
    "lineX8": X axis for line 8
    "lineY8": Y axis for line 8
    "sWeight1": Stroke weight for yellow line, the rest of the 3 lines have a stroke weight of 30.
