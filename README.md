## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

###Background Creation:

So I was going to make this post about my conceptual design but I wanted to get my head around the code further and I thought that my background would be more successfully shown by these images so I will do that in the next post instead. The idea with the background is to make it look like weaved threads, which I will explain in the next post. It is executed at the very start so it only gets drawn once, so it doesn't continue to draw over the refreshing layers. It takes one colour from the edge and extrudes it accross the entire canvas which will heighten the masked layer as it will blend into the background as a partern instead. Which will work for the images I have as they all have a simple, and similar background. However this doesn't work for the last of the images in the given sequeneces because of the reversed masks.
