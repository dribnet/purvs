## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme I am working with is 'Clutter.' I have taken photos of various messy areas around my house that have been left there. I have used irregular rectangles to increase the overall chaos of the image. Areas of clutter are highlighted in lighter colours, while other areas are darker and blend into the background. I intend to colour areas of clutter with a scribbled line to further add chaos and highlight them better.
