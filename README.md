## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Colours
   
I tried out some colours on my letters forms but this time I made the stroke on the inner arc white and thicker which looks interesting however I'm not sure if that is what I want. It might look better if it was the outer arc which was thicker and white perhaps. I think that I will test out some other colour combinations but I like the no fill on the arcs. The black and white I think works well together with the strong contrast. I still cannot figure out how to make it rotate and it changes colour so I will ask the lecturer about it. I'm not sure if I want it to rotate and change colour but it would be interesting to see what it looks like.
