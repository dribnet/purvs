## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Im slowly working through my alphabet making unique looking letters through the use of minimal silhouettes making the shape of the letter by using two black ellipses to create empty space. Im really enjoying the simple black and white characters, they are very minimal and create unique designs due to the limited capabilities of two extra ellipses. This also creates characters like E and F that look fairly similar in my alphabet. In all fairness they look pretty similar in the normal english alphabet. The background will be black in the final. Updated preview and thumbnail image too. 

I have since finished my alphabet unfortunately I couldnt push my work online for some reason so I will have to get that checked once mid tri break is over.
