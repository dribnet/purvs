## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

This is my final Version.
Zoom 1 - Window - Crystalball - Inside crystal ball(yellow decoration) - Inside yellow decoration - little white flower.

Zoom 2 - Bird - Unhappy bird

Zoom 3 - Flower - Colourful flower

My work has my strong personal style as my previous about cartoon and cute things, most of zoom pattern I use cartoon flowers and I am not add animation in my final work because this time the animation code really out of my control and most of time not work, and another reason is I feel animation is a little bit redundant for my final work. I use too many draw function to create the pattern so animation probably make my work messy.
