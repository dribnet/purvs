Here I'm just playing around with a square drawn over and over again slightly bigger each time, each rotated a bit more to create a simple flower shape. I like the effect of the lines intersecting and making the bolder lines to create a spiral. 

I got the idea from when I was in highschool and bored in math. With the squared pages you could easily draw simple geometric patterns, which I figured would be pretty easy to code. 

I also made the squares fade the bigger they get, since when I stopped drawing the squares it made the shapes super square. This way the shape looks more circular. It's pretty interesting the a whole lot of squares can make a circular shape.
