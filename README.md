## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - AGING

Now that I'm currently just adding more visual representations of my theme: aging, I focused on making the photos look older in due time. For example, my mums photo should have more wrinkles and creases because it represents the vintage treasury feel to it. I added stains relating to the photo--the first output being of a baby's hand print, and the last output being of a coffee mug stain representing my mum and how she loves her coffee and tea.
