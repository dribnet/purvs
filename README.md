## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
In the 'highlighted' parts of my image I decided to keep a pixelated style image, as it contrasts very nicely with the background. I also changed the colours to yellow/orange, and the background lines to have a blue tinge to further pull out this contrast. I noticed that a lot of glitch art has a papery texture, so I added bright dots that were slightly see through to the background to imitate this textural effect. (seen here https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ef/40/91/ef4091881a83a14fe935dd80d243c2e7.jpg)

As for the pixels, I made each row have a random  pixel height, resulting in the glitchy effect. This is often seen in digital displays that have been damaged, and can look like this (https://i.pinimg.com/564x/78/31/46/783146ecf46a757295e30493f1b98dbb.jpg).

I each layer of this image through a seperate for loop so that the pixel sizes could be different for each part (lines, circles and  glitch). This allowed me to create lots of different effects on the same canvas.


The theme I have chosen for my images is graffiti in the Wellington region. These specific images were taken in the abandoned military bunkers surrounding the city (specifically the Brooklyn windmill bunkers and Fort Ballance on Scorching Bay), where every surface is covered in colourful tags. The council doesn't bother to remove these works, so they layer up ontop of each other to create a chaotic yet beautiful pattern and texture. To me, this represents freedom of expression and art. This graffiti is not on any privately owned property, nor is it in the way of the general public. This is a form of art which is generally not acceptable to the civil eye, as it is disruptive and chaotic.

In my rendition of these pieces, I want to show off the chaos and energy these places possess. I want to celebrate the artwork done by these artists, rather than hide it.
