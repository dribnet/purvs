## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

5/5 Beziers!

-bezier design style

-made a shape editor in p5 web editor https://editor.p5js.org/verteks/sketches/_gDUaKeex
this is where I'll create letter shapes

-brought variables into draw_letters and R into letters gallery

-started experimenting with colour

Next steps : full alphabet, editor, interpolation, continue style development
