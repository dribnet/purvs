## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

i used the smartmask to create masks for my three images. Although the process was very striaght forward and simple, i wont be using it for my final. For my first image, it didn't capture the rock i was standing on and for the other two images, the mask wasnt very accurate and was missing a few sports i wanted to mask. I will be using the masks that i have created on photoshop as it is more accurate.
