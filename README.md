## Morse Code Alphabets

I have finished my letters and changed the colors to a brighter, warmer scheme to make it look more lively and playful. I ahve also added the interaction to it. Although it is pretty much finished, I think there is a lot that I can improve and I will be looking at what other changes I can make to my font. 

In morse code, a maximum of five signals are composed in one letter, therefore I made my aplhabets with 5 ellipses and changed their widht/height when needed.

20 parameters per letter, 4 for each ellipse of one alphabet:
	"ballposx"
    "ballposy"
    "ballsizew"
    "ballsizeh"
	"ball2posx"
    "ball2posy"
    "ball2sizew"
    "ball2sizeh"
    "ball3posx"
    "ball3posy"
    "ball3sizew"
    "ball3sizeh"
    "ball4posx"
    "ball4posy"
    "ball4sizew"
    "ball4sizeh"
    "ball5posx"
    "ball5posy"
    "ball5sizew"
    "ball5sizeh"
