## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

First attempt. Used a picture of friends and my cat to try and see how it works. I have found accedently that my pictures have an outline almost which I find quite interesting and want to try and potentially develop further later on in the project.
At the moment I have played around with shaped and have tried to take insiration from Low Poly Art to make my images. I have some ideas on how I could develop it so there isnt any white space. I have played around already and found that the best way might be to map the shapes to the colour but I will have to play around to see if it works. I also want to implement a randomness to it but need to experiment with it.
