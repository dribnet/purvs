I knew when first looking at this brief I wanted to create an abstract face for my final project. I like to use minimal colour palettes, clean layouts and geometry. After looking at a number of precedents I found a tattoo artist's style I really enjoyed, so decided to use this as inspiration for my population of faces. This particular artist uses clean lines and small pops of colour in his work, which were elements I decided to bring into my own project.

The majority of my facial components are straight line geometric shapes. I decided to use ellipses for the cheek features, as this helps to shift the viewer's focus through each face (along with them being the only pops of colour in a face). Each face has the same number of components, which is something I wanted to keep consistent across the board. As the faces are already so abstract, I thought having several eyes or noses would take away from them being recognisable as faces.

The variation of each facial component differs slightly:
* pupil direction changes along the x-axis
* nose and chin coordinates are drawn at slightly differing x and y points
* mouth curvature is achieved through changing the position of the triangle tip along the y-axis
* face outlines are chosen from 6 different possible shapes - 3 for the upper half, 3 for the lower
* cheek fill colour is selected from an array of 6 different shades of pink/red

The distribution of several of these are skewed towards certain values: slightly lighter cheek colours, eyes facing the right and in indifferent mouth emotion are all slightly more prevalent.

When considering the layout of my design I did think about leaving the faces in a grid of 3x5. But since my faces utilise a lot of lines and geometry, I thought that giving each face a little more spacing would benefit the overall piece. I also thought that having 15 faces to focus on was quite hard as they all fade in and out at random, meaning you would miss some of them entirely. Now with just 3 it's a lot easier to appreciate each one before it fades out and is replaced by another.
