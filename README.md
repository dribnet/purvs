I went through different iterations on how i could of done the outter perimeter, and i stuck with the circular pattern instead, which worked. I used a loop and to both the small circles and the circle outlines to get the repeated pattern. Too a while for me to learn how i can set a number of them instead of it going into a infinite loop. But i was able to get some help on how i could do it which worked in the end.

The colour scheme i went for is different shades of blue because i wanted to represent a very cool like feeling with the colour use, makes it feel modern and light. I may also edit the alpha of the colours to give the saturated look which would look nice. 

My tour sections are simple yet they are subtle. I want to keep it subtle and calming because i want to replicate a very steady and relaxing look so that when people look at it they wouldnt be blasted with different motions happening infront of them.

I'm pretty much done with what I want to implement into my project. Overall i wanted to go for a very light look on my project without having that many cluttered objects in my scene. I'll look into my code again tonight if i need anymore things to change but overall i believe that i was able to achieve my intetions in the project.

Final toughts on my work, I'm overall happy for the final outcome on this project, i believe that i was successful in implementing similar elements from my previous project to this project. I really like the aesthetic of geometric shapes and the minimalistic side of it. The tour functions shows deeper detail of small geometric shapes that construct the whole shape. 

Using the function that we were told to use were difficlt to understand at first but then i gradually started to learn their uses and how i can use them. Playing around with it helped me to achieve my goals for this project.

Lastly what i could of done to improve this better is that maybe add more dynamic movement to the whole scene as well as during the tour. Maybe as well do something interesting with colour changing as the user uses the tour. Hopefully in the future as i continue using this kind of function and learn more about it so that i can create even more of a dynamic scene.
