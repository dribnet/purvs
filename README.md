I've added my words into draw_letters.js
These words are all coffee related to fit with the theme of the font. I've chosen words that I think look good in my font, and I'm surprised how legible they are, though I know it's going to be much different for someone who has never seen the font before.




So far my parameters include:
  "size"    = hieght of ellipse
  "sizeW"   = width of ellipse 
  "offsetx" = x position offset from origin
  "offsety" = y position offset from origin
  "rectL"   = length of rectangle
  "rectW"   = height of rectangle
  "radi"    = radius of rectangle corners
  "ellPosx" = x position of the ellipse
  "ellPosy" = y position of the ellipse
