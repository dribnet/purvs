## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Looking at the themes i have gone with in this project, i started off with all the 3 images to have a very similar look. I choose a colourful alley way and took photos of 3 of my close mates. My mates are a huge part of me, and represent me quite well. Taking these photos into the coding element of the project. I wanted to emphasise on a digital reality. I tackled the background first, during my experimentation i naturally liked the grid background with rectanges lining up. and the way each square they represented a colour, I wanted to keep this but abstract it more to look like a matrix. I thought about generating random elements to my composition. From here i made my background, as its based off random colours and strokeweights creates this really interesting pixelated background. This also looking like a mosiac tiles which was really interesting in itself. After i had tackled the background, i wanted to develop the other mask. Here i first created my own masks as i noticed when playing around in earlier experiments i liked how i could mask bits of clothing into the background, i took this into my final. By developing the layers of clothing to match the background created this sort of affect as if the digital background is starting to absorb my mates. This was sort of a scary reality of our generation. Going from here i had an idea at the beginning of the project about removing unique facial features to remove identity, i tried doing this with masks and created crosses over their eyes, but the result in the composition didnt outline the crosses at all. As i still wanted to include this idea of removing identity and how cross's are often shown as a icon for this. I decided to create a cross glyph. After managing to create the simple glyph then scale it down to fit the square tile. Then i begun to play around with colours to help dilute the people. to encourage the idea of absorption. I chose a offset white to help the cross's to pop out a bit, as well as referencing the randomness by generating all the crosses to rotate randomy. this creates a great sense of diffence and sort of references how most people feel like they have little control over technology - so it comes across almost like its random. I kept the background squares to match the origin photo so that you can still make out that its a person. After finishing my code, i realised that it sort of reminds me of a hologram, again didn't plan on making it look like this but it does encourage me theme of digital reality.
