My parameters are as follows:

-triangle 1
pos2x, pos2y, pos3x, pos3y, pos4x, pos4y);


-triangle 2
pos2x2, pos2y2, pos2x3, pos2y3, pos2x4, pos2y4);


 -triangle 3
 pos3x2, pos3y2, pos3x3, pos3y3, pos3x4, pos3y4);
  
  
 -quad
 x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);

I decided to stick with my challenge of having a maximum of 4 shapes. I am thinking of dropping one of the triangles to fit the brief, but I am simply glad I have something to show at this point.



 --THE EDITOR IS WORKING!--

 After lots of fiddling around, a shape can finally be seen and adjusted with the sliders. This took several hours to figure out, but it now works well enough and my focus will go into finalising the presentation aspects.

 I am quite happy with the geometric aesthetic that my alphabet has become, and I find it satisfying watching the words change bit by bit. I may yet tweak some of the designs, but for now I am content with this progress.
