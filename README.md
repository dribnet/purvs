### Super Clock Land

---

A retro-style floating island scene that reacts to the current time. Adhering roughly to the capabilities of the Super Game Boy, an add-on peripheral for the Super Nintendo.

---

#### Changes:
+ Further implementation of palette tile functionality

#### Current Issues:
+ Not really a clock.
+ Ocean currently does not use palette swapping scheme, though *technically* is still within the limitations of the SGB
+ No palettes yet

#### To Do:
+ Start actually implementing the scene
+ Nail down the colours + implement palette tiles

#### Notes:
+ This looks like the heterosexual pride flag.
