## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I further developed my code that change some of the pixels into more complicated shapes rather than the simple ellipses. Because I want to represent the small happiness in the normal life, I used flower shapes so the masked area will be full of colourful flowers. I also set the random size to the flowers but so far it is not distinct and I will change the random range into bigger numbers. Also I will add random rotation to each flower to make the final result more interesting. 
I used translate and rotate function on the pixels at the background. However, it seems like the rotation may be to much and the background is unreadable. I want to emphasis the foreground but also keep the background visible so that the audience will know the happiness is everywhere in their life.
