Each of my letters is composed with two squares. The size and shape of each shape are controlled by the 14 parameters that I have set, they control how each of the squares are shaped to create each letter. I took my inspiration from a font called Jersey Sharp which I renamed to SERRATED in the exhibition to make smaller so that it would have enough letters to not be taken over by my default shape that I created at the start to kick start my alphabet. The alphabet that I have created is usog that same sharp edges from the font to create my letters because I thought that they would be a really effective way of portraying my letters. 

These are the parameters per letter:

 "offsetx"
 "offsety"
 "offsetx2"
 "offsety2"
 "offsetx3"
 "offsety3"
 "offsetx4"
 "offsety4" Offset X and Y 1-4 are the parmaeters for the first shape for each letter. 


 "offsetx5" Offset X and Y 4-8 are the parameters for the second shape of each letter. 
 "offsety5"
 "offsetx6"
 "offsety6"
 "offsetx7"
 "offsety7"
 "offsetx8"
 "offsety8"
