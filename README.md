## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel - AGING

I have added the white scratch marks on the black and white filter by editing the masks. I like the way it looks "old" however I might still need to edit a few things. I finally got a photo of my sister's baby photo, next, is my mum. Through this, I can convey the aging through these photos. I believe aging is a beautiful, natural thing in life, and that we shouldn't be afraid of it. In all stages, we are happy, especially my mum who I respect and love a lot, she is very carefree. The famouse quote, "We only live once". Next, I will update my mum's photo on the third output picture.

(Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.)
