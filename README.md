Experiment: curves. 

TEXTURE - committing this one because the texture I accidentally made with bezier curves in a for loop looks cool and fits with the abstract vibe, but deffinately not what I was going for!!

For this experiment I used the curveVertex function on my pre-existing parameters. At first everything was missing the last line, so I added another parameter. All of the letters also went outside of their 100x200 boxes, so this needed a lot of tweeking. 

In my mind when creating this, I was drawing inspration from very abstrtact works like this inked artwork (https://www.flickr.com/photos/swahiligonzili/8316978053/in/contacts/) and the work of a.creature on Instagram, who uses a lot of wiggly line imagery (https://www.instagram.com/a.creature/). The colour scheme for this version is also inspired by their work.

This  version of the font looks more like earthworms and less like the tomb engravings that my first version of the font was going for.  It is a lot more chance, most of the curves and forms are accidental. 

Parameters:
  "pointoneX" - first vertex X
  "pointoneY": - first vertex Y
  "pointtwoX": - second vertex X
  "pointtwoY": - second vertex Y
  "pointthreeX": - third vertex X
  "pointthreeY": - third vertex Y
