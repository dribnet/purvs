## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So I have come up with another idea playing with people in nature. Im going to dee if I can do 3 layers to a mask and have the greenery as one layer, the people as another layer and everything else in the last layer. Or I might make the background layer naturistic and the foreground layer pixelated to hide the identity of the people.

I have added the pictures that I wanted to add of people in nature and am now going to make a mask out of them from toms masking code. This means I have to transfer everything over to macs as I am on windows. I just want to make some simple masks and then photoshop the mask background on.
