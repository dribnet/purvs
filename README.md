MY FIRST ITERATIONS

Before starting my code I used gird paper to draw some designs to figure out what kind of style I wanted to go for. I decided that it would be cool to work with different kinds of shapes to build this letter form. Lots of the designs that I crafted were going to use too many parameters if I decided to go with them. I initially wanted to keep the proportions of the shapes all the same and just adjust the size and rotation but after playing around with the sketch code I noticed that it was going to work for every letter and would use too many parameters. 

I have used 20 parameters which consist of one rectangle, two arcs and also a tringle but I'm currently not using the triangle so I may remove this completely. I want this style of my letter to be clean and minimal, designs that give off enough shape to recognise the letter. I'm going for a playful blocky look.  For the colour palette, I have gone with a soothing light blues to a dark navy blue. One thing I wpouldnt mind trying is playing with the opacity of the letters, i think this will create some cool designs especially when the shapes overlap.

The twenty parameters per letter:
  * `rectX` : x location of the rectangle
  * `rectY` : y location of the rectangle
  * `rectW` : width of the rectangle
  * `rectH` : height of the rectangle
  * `arcW` : width of the arc
  * `arcH` : height of the arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the first arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the first arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the first arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the first arc
  * `arcX` : x location of the second arc
  * `arcY` : y location of the second arc
  * `arcS` : angle to start the second arc
  * `arcE` : angle to end the second arc
  * `triX1` : x location of the first point of the triangle
  * `triY1` : Y location of the first point of the triangle
  * `triX2` : x location of the second point of the triangle
  * `triY2` : Y location of the second point of the triangle
  * `triX3` : x location of the third point of the triangle
  * `triY3` : Y location of the thrid point of the triangle
