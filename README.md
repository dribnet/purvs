I have refined and renamed my parameters so that they are all effective and are all named correctly. 
After completing most of the alphabet in code today I realized I have to include a few more parameters as forming letters such as S, X, Z has been too challenging. I may simply have to map one of the variables to another of the rectangles, and control them both through one parameter. I am happy however with how my letters are animating they look smooth and clean. I now have more work to do figuring out what modifications my variables need in order to communicate the entire alphabet effectively.


I have refined my parameters to seven and they are: 

      * "lengthV2": The length of the second vertical rect.
      * "offsetxV1": x offset of the first vertical rect.
      * "offsetxV2": x offset of the second vertical rect.
      * "offsetyH1": y offset of the first horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyH2": y offset of the second horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyH3": y offset of the third horizontal rect.
      * "offsetyV2" y offset of the secpond vertical rect.
