## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The beads have again been slightly updated. 
- They change size based off of how bright the pixel they represent is. 
- Opacity has been changed to 100 to give translucency 

The grid is remains mostly the same but I changed the opacity of the lines to be slightly translucent and less bright/intense. This seems to help the contrast in the image as the image felt very dense in the last iteration.

Again Iâ€™m not happy as with the outcome as the two elements (grid and the squares) dont produce a cohesive image.
