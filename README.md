After testing out different levels of zoom and originally having it change from a solid wave shape to waves made of circles I have decided that makes more sense to start with the circles rather than the solid shape. This is because when zoomed into the circles you cant see the shape the circles make and it looks confusing, whereas when zoomed out you can see the whole wave.
