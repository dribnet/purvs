This is a program that generates an iterative wallpaper and a generative landscape.Using "space" key to switch between modes and mouse click to change the pattern of landscape.

###Iterative Pattern

My initial inspiration was from the pattern of circuit board that each pin has its own connection with other pins nearby. The difference of colours represents different types of pins. The feeling of electronics is weaken after the connections are changed to a fixed direction. At the beginning, I felt it is not as interesting as it was before and then I have created some totally different patterns as experiment. When I looked back and compared the pattern with others, I decided to keep using it. The pattern is more like mechanical weaving. The colours and connections create a specific rhythm for this pattern.

###Generative Landscap

The idea was changed several times while it was been developing.In class example code from Tom, I found the use of colours and noise is interesting .Therefore I started with writing similar code to generate landscape of the forest. By adding randomness and offset to the grid to simulate natural phenomenon, the pattern looks more dynamic. I decided to change my idea to starry sky when I changing the colour scheme because it is extended and ever - changing, which illustrates the idea well with this project.The noise function creates certain areas making the clouds have different layers which looks more realistic.
