## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I had thought my Interaction was broken but what had actually happened was I accidentally deleted one of the values in my A when I was trying to clean up my code so I changed that and everything is working fine. One issue with the look of my letter transitions is that I'm not using all my variables in my letters so parts of the letters transition and other parts just appear. I think with the black boxes in some letters I could make it so the boxes are drawn in every letter but in some they are completly transparent which would allow them to appear. I can't think of a way of doing that with unused lines though, I would need an opacity parameter for all 4 lines. I already have 12 parameters so that would bring me up to 16. I'm not sure if it's worth it. Maybe I'll give it a shot and if it looks really cool I'll keep it and if it's still weird I won't. I'm still not totally sure how to go about it anyway.
