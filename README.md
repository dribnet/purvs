## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This the first time I've started to experiment with masks. Honestly if masks werent a part of the brief then I wouldnt use them. I feel like its a fun challenge to try an highlight the objects in my images without just cropping them out using a mask. I tried to do a few interesting things like in the second image with the scrabble tile where one is glitching out and is missing pixels but im not sure if I like it. This experiment is really just a combination of my last two, where the faces that I want to highlight Ive filled in using a mask. I do like this result, however I think its still too organised. i think ill experiment with masks a little more. I do really like the contrast between the two styles of rendering that I have going on however.
