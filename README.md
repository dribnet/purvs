## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

06/04	My letterforms work by having each parameter correspond with one point of each triangle. 2 triangles = 12 parameters per letterform. The red triangle uses the parameters point1A, point2A, point3A, point1B, point2B, point3B. The black triangle uses the parameters point1C, point2C, point3C, point1D, point2D, point3D.
I'm currently working on rearranging my parameters so that the interaction transition between letters has the triangles rotating correctly. This means the triangles won't flip and rotate awkwardly. I'm currently up to correcting letter M.
I have to consider how I'm using negative space and whether am applying it consistently, and having the numbers use the black triangle as the dominant triangle in the letterform to distiinguish them from the main alphabet.
The exhibition.html is a cool place to hang out and try thinking of words to challenge my font to see how well it works. As I expected, the "E", "M", "N" etc, are pretty difficult to read, and my "E" and "Z" look almost identical. I saw this coming, because my "E" is a lowercase placeholder (because I didn't really know how to make an E), where everything else is uppercase. I'll work on it :)
