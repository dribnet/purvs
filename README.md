In my example I was inspired by fractal coasts and cells. I like the theory that coasts are fractal and the furthur you zoom into one the more coast you see leading to technically infinite coastline. I also liked the imagry of zooming into cells where somthing small has incredible complexity within it that is only revealed when zooming in.


I have completed part 2 by drawing various circles within eahc other with an alpha value to try and simulate the idea of translucency in the liquid cell interior, i only created one cell as in the future I want to parametise this single shape and then procedurally create a vast array of them.
I initially found it tricky as to understand the exact location of where to alter the parameters to make it scale properly but worked it out after a long period of trial and error.
I want to make more detail appear at higher zooms for instance make certain structures appear like mitocondria or choloroplasts or somthing along those lines. Even maybe chromosomes and dna.

I have worked my idea into a tiling pattern which is nice as the design now spreads to infinity. the next step is to add layers to the design then implement noise in the distribution to appear more natural, then i want to have subtle animation in the parts to simulate floating around like cells do BOOM! THERES HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.

Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
