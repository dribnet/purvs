## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Final:
My final font is called "RunicTim" (it would be RunicTime but i only had eight letters). I choose this name for one reason and its because in designing this alphabet i thought about how the runic alphabet would have evolved through the times to create a sort of english runic hybrid. 

When designing i made sure to stick to the main theme that i found in runic symbols and that was straight lines, there seemed to be no curves of any sorts when i did reasearch around the runic symbols, and thats because it made it easier to carve into stone and wood where as a curve would have been more difficult with there technology at the time.

When putting the english alphabet and the runic symbols together I focused on first creating the runic symbols, and then begun adpating them to look more like the english alphabet while still having aspects of the runic symbols, thats why the o is not just a circle but has to lines poking out of the bottom this was to keep the orinal aspect of the symbol but also make it noticable by the reader that the symbol is a o.

Through out this project it had a huge ammount of reasearching about the runic symbols which created this final product. I learned a whole lot of interesting information and backstroy about the language which i feel helped me relise the importance of reasearching about your design ideas before and after creating the project.


I have started with my basic design i have started with creating my A B C and went with a runic alphabet theme

I have completed and made what i want my full alphabet to look like and now implimenting it from sketch.js to draw_lettters.js and letters.js. I am running into a few problems as i did intianally hard code the alphabet and had to change it up a bit so that all the letters would be under the 12 varible mark that is set for this assignment. 

I have completed implementing my whole alphabet into the letters.js and draw_letters.js. I just need to do a few tweaks to the design and I should have my project completed.

I have changed up my alphabet a bit like the C so it fits in more with the runic theme. I also added in the animation of the alphabet, its a bit janky, but I actually like it this way its like the lines get all jumbled up and then morphs into the letters.
