## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Heres another experiment, this is similar to last in that it uses continuous lines, except this time I have a line per per pixel, to make a large cross hatch, With a line made up of all of the pixels as vertices, I then added a parallax effect to the vertices, where the strength of the parallax is proportionate to the darkness of the pixel. This gives a fantastic 3d effect, A bipodruct of this effect is that when i add a fill back in, the fill effect each 'slice' of the image, which then contort to parallax, giving a really nice an abstract cascading effect. Personally I really like these images, I think the colour works great, and theres just enough detail to work out what the images are of. I do like the card image in this set, even if its really difficult to understand what it is, im still looking to retake this photo.
