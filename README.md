## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've drawn silhouettes instead of making them from photos as I didn't have models. 

So far I've drawn a grown woman, a depressed teenager and two children. Since they're silhouettes, there aren't any details so I tried to convey their mood through their poses and figure. The woman is chubby and she is ashamed of wearing a large size, so her thought is to want to become skinny. The teenager is bullied for a specific trait she has (I haven't decided what it is yet), and the children are positive as they express their imagination of what they'd like to be. I feel it is a little difficult conveying my idea as the theme is a little specific, especially when it comes to displaying the characters' thoughts visually, but this is a start.
