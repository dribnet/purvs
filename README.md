## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I took some photos and select these three photo as my images that I will render in pixerls in the next step. 
I wanted to focus on the small but easy being ignored happiness in the daily life, so I shoot the photos that record the moments I feel happiness. For example, the hot drink and scarf in cold days, the discount of shops and the last cup-cake in my favourite flavor.
