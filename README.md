## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Made the geometry of '1' conenct, and considered moving the bottom circle up to make the appendage longer, but ended up not keeping that.

Made the stroke a bit darker.

Testing several different ways of designing the 'm'. Landed on a version that looks like a "movie clapper".

Changed the '0' to be the same as the 'o', except moved it upwards.



I feel like not making the previously mentioned uniform rule, because it takes away freedom.


Worked on '2' for a bit, and not entirely happy with it, but it is what it is for now.

On the 'N', I moved the bottom circle in a bit, because taking another look at it, I thought it just didn't look right being out so far.






I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
