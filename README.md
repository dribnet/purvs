## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Bex helped me get my wheel done! It looks quite cool and interesting! Now i have to work on getting the timing of it right. I like how it is simple but still look cool. i also need to figure out how to get the letters to only appear once the wheel is done rotating. At the moment it is appearing halfway through the spin. Looks a bit messy. 

!!!!! Code problem !!!!
I found with my interpolate rotation, it doesn't seem to work properly in both the interaction.html and exhibition.html. Basically It only works in one or the other. So i have done my code in a way that makes it work on the exhibition mode as i feel this is more important.
