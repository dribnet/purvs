Each of my letters consist of two triangles that occupy a larger sphere, the size of the sphere is set as a constant and if changed, the points for each trianlge will also update. Each letter currently consists of 12 parameters.

The 12 parameters per letter:
  * `pointone` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  * `pointTwo` : "ang" angle of point and "dist" distance from center.
  etc..

I have completed the parameters for my alphabet so am now looking into different styles and what style will be used for my final alphabet.

 - Style Four
 	- Outline

 	This last style explores the letters being represented through line rather than form.

 	 With each layer only having an outline to represent it.
