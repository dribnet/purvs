I started developing on my original bear sketch, i really liked playing around with the transitions between different stances and especially clothing, in the end I started to research about how we define faces.I stumbled onto a very interesting online talk bt Matt Rhodes (concept artist at bioware) that partly looks at how to define character from form, and how 95% of human characters are exactly the same if you strip back the details like hair and tatoos and markings. From there I kinda wanted to experiment with this and push it further.
Starting with this blank face I moved further with creating context around the face and tried to create a bit of interest around a fairly simplistic form.
