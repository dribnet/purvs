When approaching this problem set I wanted to look closely into a style or theme to help guide the art direction in both the iterative pattern and the generative landscape. I wanted a underlying theme for both designs to help create a sense of cohesiveness in the problem set.

I had in mind to look at 90's styled pattern designs. I felt this was a great starting point as the designs are colourful and fun. I looked primarily at the creation of a grid based geomtric design. I implemented an underlying pattern layer of squiggles as I found this was a prevalent element in many 90's styled patterns. I complemented this with a grid of randomly assigned geometric shapes.

Colour plays a massive role in these 90's styled wallpaper patterns, therefore I wanted to explore the use of bright and bold colours in a variety of combinations.

To complement the 90's theme I wanted to employ a similar style in the generative landscape. I opted for an 80's neon theme. This alligned nicely with the idea of using influential art styles from certain decades. The wireframe landscape art work in the 80's style features a bright neon colour palette and retro skyline landscape.

I used noise values to generate mountains and waves. These are then complemented by the bright grid lines and sun. Similar to the 90's art style, colour plays a massive role in the success of the art work. Exploring deep red, blue and purple tones was key in capturing the essence of the decade.

Unfortuntely the performance of the sketch seemed to take a massive hit when producing the generative landscape. Moving forward with this landscape design  improving this performance is definitely something I would look to prioritise. I would also like to look into additional colour palettes and building types. In terms of moving forward with the iterative pattern, I feel that adding more shape types would benefit the design. I also thnk that looking at changing rotations and scales of individual shapes in the design would improve the overall result.
