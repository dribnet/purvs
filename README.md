## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Experimenting with lines

So far I like the look of using lines for my images. The only thing I'm struggling with right now is making sure the code makes ALL three images look good and work accordingly to my plan. I feel like its easier to make the first image of the peacock plant look good due to its larger details. I still need to experiment to find the best shapes to accentuate the details of the leaves. For sure I want to use lines. I may also experiment using arcs, which might make the images more interesting. I will be focusing more on finding the best texture/shapes to create my image before moving on to changing the image colours.
