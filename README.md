## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Finally finished an dfinalised the colours, I went with a basic Black and White layout as it makes the smaller parts stand out easier against the constant white circle. I am very pleased with how I have done throughout this project.



The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  'start' : First angle for my arc
  'stop' : Second angle for my arc
