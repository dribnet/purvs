I went with a spiral idea, which morphs into a zooming tunnel.

The outer layer is a moving spiral of circles, drawing the eyes to the centre. The centre circle appears ordinary at first, but as you zoom it becomes apparent that it is made up out of lots of lines. The other circles shrink as you zoom, granting more importance to the centre.
