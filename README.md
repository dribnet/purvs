## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Today I have managed to fix the line around the flowers. I haven't yet figured out how to completely flip the arc but I like that its on an angle since at the flowers are straight. My next step is to refine my mask. I have a lot of grass going into the flowers and flower green grass which looks interesting as an overlay however, I have the light grey and dark grey mask layers in my code so I might as well play around with it. 

The images above are photos of Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, Netherlands, algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
