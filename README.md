 Currently my 10 variable per letter are:
  - vertX: X position of initial start of the line(anchor point)
  - vertY: Y position of initial start of the line(anchor point)
  - ctrlPx: X position of the control point for vertX
  - ctrlPy: Y position of the control point for vertY
  - vertX2: X position of the end point of the line(anchor point)
  - vertY2: Y position of the end point of the line(anchor point)
Added:
  - ctrlPx2: X position of the control point for the second curve
  - ctrlPy2: Y position of the control point for the second curve
  - vertX3: X position of the end point of the second curve(anchor point)
  - vertY3: Y position of the end point of the second curve(anchor point)

  I was planning on uploading progression as I went thru completing my alphabet. But I got too carried away and forgot to upload the process. I also spent less time refining what the letter fonts would look like, compared to when I just did the ABC I was very critical of what every letter looked like. The reason for this is because some of the letters with the current constraints in place are unable to look exactly like the original letter(K, T, X). I've accepted that all the letters won't be exactly perfect even though I wanted to create a legible font I was more interested in the intricacy and complexity of the re-creation of Illustrator's pen tool and the constraints of the p5.js API. Tomorrow I will continue in making the number forms and extra characters and then hope to get the animation working smoothly. I've througholy enjoyed this part of the project as I found it quite relaxing compared to being very critical of how the font looked.s
