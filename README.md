### 28/04/22 Sketch

I started working on other letters. Since I'm only using 2 simple no round shapes, it was hard to make letters those have rounded shapes and have more than 2 structural shapes such as, G and X. I still need to find the way to make numbers in different way as the letters because otherwise they will both look same.
