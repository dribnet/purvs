## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Jun.7th 2020
These photos show the scenery and people of Morocco, Japan and China. I hope to show the similarity of people through digital art. So many things have happened in the world recently, and I want to express that people everywhere are similar and equal. Even if people have different environments, different living habits, and wear different clothes, everyone has the same emotions. People work hard, have goals, and love their family and friends.
I'm trying to blur the background environment and highlight the appearance of people.
