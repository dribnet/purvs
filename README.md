## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Replaced the third image and masked it. Just wanted to see what my other images look like with the code. Might put the basketball one back up of my uncle. 

Still using tiles examples from class but it is further developed into my own. I experimented using colour as the strokes but didn't quite like it as much. There was a piece of code that I liked for my second image in a previous commit so I don't know, I may or may not go back to it- it's all a part of the process.

Having a bit of trouble trying to establish what colour strokes I want for the background and the subject- I keep swapping the black and white stroke colours for the back ground and the subject. But looking at my commits, I do see older code that I like more. 

What I aim to do next. Continue developing my code, go back and look at my older code and implement it back in if I want. Also replacing images and re-masking accordingly.
