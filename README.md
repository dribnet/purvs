## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Part 3.

Still using parts of the example code, including different grid techniques. 

The first two images are updated using triangles in the background and in the subject. I did have the triangles in the background and in the subject I used rectangles, however, they didn't mesh well together so I tried triangles.

I used triangles because patterns in the Samoan culture include "arrowheads" and triangle symbols so I wanted to incorporate that and link it to my theme. There is also gaps with the background and it is probably related to the "tile" contrainsts I have in the code so I will look at adjusting that.

In the 3rd image it is using the old code I previously had to show the difference of how the old code looks vs the new code. 

What to do next: I do want to remask the first image or maybe just continue iterating the code. I also might change the 3rd image to an image of either my tattoo or my dad's tattoo because I want my images to relate to eachother. I also want to try and get the triangles bigger. 

One other thing I want to do is to have the image appear smoothly rather than just suddenly appearing on the screen when I reload it.
