I could've done a few different things for the 's', but this way, with only 2 circles used, made more sense.

I tried mirroing the 's' to make the 'z', but after some tweaking I think this version more clearly communicates the 'Z' shape.



I've used 3 ellipses and 1 rectangle.

There are 10 parameters being used, which are:
	
	Size - for the rectangle length
	Offsetx - for the rectangle's coordinate x
	Offsety - for the rectangle's coordinate y
	Rotate - for rotating the rectangle

	and then an 'Offsetx' and 'Offsety' for each ellipse xy coordinate.
