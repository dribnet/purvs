## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos I have taken myself of my dog as a puppy. The mask highlights the entirety of the dog. I want to show a theme that relates to the love that needs to be put into breeding dogs instead of focusing on how they look. For my third design, I have created the dog using a heart glypth. I think the idea might look better if the dog itself was in black and white to further emphasise the design.

The algorithm uses a new heart glyph design to create the dog.
