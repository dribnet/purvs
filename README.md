## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2
 
Concept: 
Each of my letters will be composed with one circle, one rectangle and one arc. The size and x position of the first circle is fixed, but the positon and size of the arc and rect changes with each letter and is controlled by the parameters. I have started with very simpistic forms that are similar to my handwriting and have a soft, readible design.

The eleven parameters per letter:
  * `ellipseY` : y position of the main circle
  * `width` : size of the arc
  * `height` : size of the arc
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the arc in relation to the circle 
  * `offsety` : y offset of the arc in relation to the circle
  * `angleStart` : angle to start the arc
  * `angleStop` : angle to finish the arc
  * `rectX` : x positon of the rect
  * `rectY` : y positon of the rect
  * `rectW` : width of the rect
  * `rectH` : height positon of the rect

My initial idea was based around soft, simplistic shapes that had a playful design with the curves and brighter colours. As I started creating the alphabet, I realised that I was finding it hard to create variety and did not know how I would draw the numbers. To fix this issue, I sketched out a new idea that incorporated the elements I already had but added in a rect. Allowing me to create letters easier and add another element to the design to make it more visually interesting. I had to add four more parameters, bringing my total to eleven. It was a necessary change in my design as it was now a lot more readable and had a cleaner look that resembled my handwriting. I continued with this design and changed the background colour to an off-white to work in better with the colours used in the letters. This helped the overall design to feel more minimalist, clear and soft. The last notable design change I made was curving the edges of the rect. This created a more cohesive design and allowed the rect to belong and fit in better with the curved ellipse and arc. It was also the point where I felt that the design was balanced and completed to a point that I was happy with.

I chose to name my alphabet ‘constant’ because of its connection to the ellipse that has a constant x position and size. I found that the ellipse was a central part of the design because it does not change and I wanted to reflect that. For the letters in constant, the ellipse’s y position also does not change so I took that into consideration when I choose the name as it would display on the exhibition nicely.
