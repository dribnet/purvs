I tested out another set of colours. This time i tried yellow and orange which I like as it looks like a sunset or sunrise in a way. However I removed the fill from the inner arc and added a fill to the outer arc and I think I like this as it looks prettty interesting. I think it would look better if it transparent slightly. I think I will test out some more colours and see how they look.   

pos2x this draws the x position of the first point

pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
