## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This version of experimentation involves changing the circles to lines to see what different effects can be created. Still themed as below: preview and thumbnail not updated.


My initial experiments involve a selection of images from 3 different possible themes I am considering.

The first theme is moments with friends / family.
The second theme option is interesting architecture / the built environment
The third option is electronics hardware related.

Currently each image has a custom mask made by me and is processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html)."

The masks for each photo highlight key aspects in each of them.
