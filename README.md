## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos from a trip to Japan I went on in 2015. They all share similar colours and moods so I thought they would be good subjects for this project.

Yet another experiment. I found by increasing the tile size of the grid, but not the actual grid itself, then turning down the  opacity gave a really cool effect. It creates a sort of grid within a grid which also reminded me of the trip these photos are from. I had either just got a new pair of glasses that didn't arrive in time, or broken my normal ones and had to resort to using my previous prescription. Needless to say I couldn't see that well. I kind of ran with this memory and decided to use opacity and layering to make the images blurrier. I think I've pretty much got my aesthetic sussed, now I will fine tune it and play around with my masks a bit more.
