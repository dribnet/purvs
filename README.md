I have started boxing out my alphabet. I have started with the two triangles but still wanting to put a line in the centre of some or most letters if i can. I will now look at finishing my alphabet and numbers as well as the colours.

The parameters per letter are now:
  let pos1x = posx + letterData["x"];
  let pos1y = posy + letterData["y"];
  let pos2x = posx + letterData["2x"];
  let pos2y = posy + letterData["2y"];
  let pos3x = posx + letterData["3x"];
  let pos3y = posy + letterData["3y"];
    
  let pos4x = posx + letterData["4x"];
  let pos4y = posy + letterData["4y"];
  let pos5x = posx + letterData["5x"];
  let pos5y = posy + letterData["5y"];
  let pos6x = posx + letterData["6x"];
  let pos6y = posy + letterData["6y"];
<!--   * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one -->
