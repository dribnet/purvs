## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I just uploaded my final sketch, this final sketch shows how I want my final alpahabet to go.  The grey rectangles are going to be roads, and the red rectangles will be the cars).  I will add road lines (white/yellow dotted line to create sides of the road) and include regular streetlamps/bushes etc. 


I have a half working alphabet currently, however I need to do a lot more.  Right now, my letters are using 21 parameters, so I am going to change it to less.   Therefore, I need to be strategic on what 'cars' go where.   I also want to design the rectangle boxes into more details -adding dotted lines and bushes.  

As you can see, I have cleaned up a little bit my 'cars', however, now I've decided they can't be crashing so will spread them apart again.   I have also added traffic lights and the road lines to make sure my design looks like a road!   I think this already looks a lot better, and I like the theme that is starting to go on.
