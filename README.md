## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

I've played around with my animations and have smoothed them out. This has resulted in some of the letters changing shape for more fluidity. I like the idea of an eccentric aesthetic so even the more abrupt transitions add to the playfulness of the lettering.

The parameters per letter:
  offsetx - the x offset of the letter components
  offsety - the y offset of the letter components
  triangleX1 - first x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY1 - first y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX2 - second x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY2 - second y co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleX3 - third x co-ordinate of the triangle
  triangleY3 - third y co-ordinate of the triangle
  arcSizeX - arc length on the x axis
  arcSizeY - arc length on the y axis
  arcStart - beginning of the arc in degrees
  arcEnd - end of the arc in degrees
