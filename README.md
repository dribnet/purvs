   The concept of these alphabet is from the audio pitch.

   In my sketch, I said the A tone is smoother than C tone is true.

   But after doing the whole alphabet, I realized only C D E F G A B can easily use this concept. So I think I may stand on use one element to help this project to become a imagine the tones of these 36 alphabet.

   The difference between this one and previous one is I changed the background guide-line to stave and set the C D E F G A B in the position of Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Xi. Following the yellow arc's angle it point to the alphabet's position in stave. 

   I also change the definition of each parameters, I add scale into each arc and each arc has their own parameter. Before the blue arc and green arc have same Y, in this version I had changed.

   About the colour scheme, I did not choose use black and white. I know black and white will be easy to connect with piano and stave, but I prefer to choose pink, yellow, green and blue to show the energy of music and tones.

   Pink is the background colour, the yellow arc is help to point out the position also show the tone of each alphabets.
   
   x,y2 and x5,y5 control the blue arc
   x2,y3 and x6,y6 control the yellow arc
   x3,y and x7,y7 control the green arc
   scale control the blue arc size
   scale2 control the yellow arc size
   scale3 control the green arc size
