I have now finished my letter form I am now onto playing around the with the exhibitor.
My favourite form that I have made is the two because I think it exhibits the rules that I have chosen for myself in a very aesthetically pleasing way.
I had to abandon one of my rules that I set out for myself and that was the rule where all negative spaces has to form a triangle. In hindsight this was a very hard task to set, since it's hard enough to make some of the letter's and numbers with triangles. If I had more time I would definetely do it though.
The letters which don't nessercarily need 3 triangles to be complete were the most difficult for me to make because then I had to come up with a place to put the third triangle. For some help with this task I looked up the particular letter/number on google and tried to find variations of it that would fit into my rules.
