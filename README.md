I've decided to emulate a 90's pattern design for my iterative wallpaper. The first stage I am looking into is the background squiggle designs. I am using arcs to create the squiggles across the same grid design I used in my initial iteration. I have included sliders to adjust stroke weight and the number of columns and rows.
