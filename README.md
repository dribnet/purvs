## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I chose 3 images I took last year in some holiday destinations my family and I hold very close to our hearts.
The left image was taken in Hong Kong, the middle was taken in Pattaya, Thailand and the third in Bangkok, Thailand.
I chose these images because they give me a lot of options when choosing how to draw my pixelated image.

I started updated my sketch.js by changing the number of points and point size.
For my masks, I blacked out peoples faces, signs and paths.
Where the mask is black the points draw square instead of circle.
