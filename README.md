  Cosmetic iteration;
  I have swapped the colours around to reference the connection to Adobe Illustrator and the colour scheme of the UI.
  I have used a darker grey for the background and font and light grey for the rectangle as in reference to the artboard of Illustrator.
  The change of colours has created the visual perception that the square has had a line cut out of it rather than a line placed on top of it as in the previous iteration. By making this change it connects back to one of inital inspirations of Gestalt.

  I am now happy with the current iteration of my font and will now focus on catching up.
