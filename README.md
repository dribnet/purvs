## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2
**Letters**
- Worked on the letter y as it is one of my least favourites.
- I will continue working on the look of my numbers because they are still not 100% what I want them to look like, just need to polish them up.
- Restructured and cleaned up my code.
- I created my default character to look like both a question mark and an exclamation mark, it will depend on the viewers personal interpretation. I have spoken to Bex and I would prefer if I didn't have to use the default character, so Bex suggested using an if statement so when its called it doesn't draw it just leaves it blank. 

Currently I have 15 parameters:

*Shape1 the arc*
1. size: The size of the arc
2. offsetx: x offset of the arc
3. offsety: y offset of the arc
4. arcStart: starting angle for the arc
5. arcEnd: ending angle for the arc

*Shape2 the second circle*
6. size1: The size of the ciccke
7. offsetx2: x offset of the circle
8. offsety2: y offset of the cicrle

*Shape3 the rectangle*
9. width: width of the rectangle
10. height: height of the rectangle
11. offsetx3: x offset of the rectangle
12. offsety3: y offset of the rectangle
13. angle: angle of rotation of the rectangle
14. translatex: the x translation for the degree of rotation
15. translatey: the y translation for the degree of rotation
