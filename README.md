PART 2:

I have added two additional landmarks into face_data.json - one for andy serkis and one with the CGI gollum. I thought it would be interesting to see how well I could try to map my gollum face - which is what I'm continuing to call it, even though nobody thinks it looks like gollum - to the real ones. 

I have tried to create some of the recognisable features of my face.js in the facemap.js. Specifcally, I have changed the eyebrows into a monobrow, which is still mapped to the eyebrow positions. I've also tried to add teeth in which use the position of the bottom lip and the nose tip as landmarks. I tried using the top lip rather than the nose, however, there are too many landmarks in the lips to create accurate teeth (or so I found).
