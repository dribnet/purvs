Part 3

Changed the amount of detail appearing at different zoom levels so it isn't so awkward. I've also added a glow around the planets and rings and moons at zoom level 3 and 4. I've also given the planets more moons, and allowed some of the planets with rings moons also to give more visual interest. 

Next up I'll add some comets, and maybe some more colour to the planets when you zoom in more.
