## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Iteration:
After much experimentation with different compositions, field blurs and masks I have finally found an image input that i'm happy to use for my submission. What i'm struggling with now is choosing a render that i'm happy with because the images are mostly generative in how they are produced each image/render is different even if I don't change the parameters there will always be a slight visual difference and I find certain images have some aspects that are really nice that aren't in the others but again because it's generative it's hard to get those aspects that I consider nice into one render. Which should be something that I consider if I was to pursue this project further.

What I still need to do for final output is list the parameters used for rendering and writing the narrative that has been constantly changing but on a similar theme and also finalizing my third and final image.
