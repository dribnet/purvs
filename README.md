## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this exercise, I randomly chose 3 pictures for my experiments. For the masking past, I have tried to mask three of the pictures with white, black and grey. The first picture is only white and black. The second picture is white and grey. I have used all three colours for the third picture. For the algorithm, I haven't changed anything yet. I will continue experimenting the algorithm.
