Experiment 1

 I decided to add some more colour to some of my shapes to help distinguish them more from each other. So I added another if statement and made it so that if it equaled two rather than one the shape would become a turquoise colour. This did make my letters different but did not help to define the shape of the letter form better. Therefore, I decided to really go with the abstract thinking that my code looked like some sort of puzzle therefore it would be great if it were sort of a like a puzzle to work out what the letters were. I also have kept the colours the same throughout because I think it fits well with my idea of my letterforms being a code and they are also blocky and remind me of matrix code.
