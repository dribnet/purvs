## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Droplets
Final

Im really happy with how my design came out. I orginally wanted to create something like this, with rounded edges that kinda float into eachother to create words. I first created a black and white alphabet using only 3 ellipses however that was rather dull and strayed away from my orginal idea. 
(This idea is saved in the Json under "First Alphabet")

From here I had a similar idea where I only use lines. I thought that only using one type of imput would help keep my design minimal which it did for the most part. I did want to keep my text readable too and for it to be soft and easy to look at. I did create an extra light blue line to create a glossy texture to my font.

I wanted to create a transition that would help emphasize the bubbles, I liked the slow transition of the basic transition but I still wanted to make it more unique so I changed the stroke weight (SW) of one of my lines in the space of 70% - 100% Making it stationary for the first 70% then making it suddenly get larger or smaller. Making it look like the bubble is combining and growing or suddenly popping. I think this creates a fun bubbly element which ties in nicely with my design.

Unfortunately during the middle of the project I wasnt able to commit my work so I had to hold off commiting until I fixed the bug. I also just do a lot of work on my project at one time and I do forget to commit often. leaving me with only a few comits. 

I did look at one of the examples from blackboard but it mainly just reminded me of my orgininal idea and inspired me to continue with it. 


Edits on this commit.

After looking at my Exhibiton I decided I liked the way 'Droplets' looked rather than 'Bubbles!' I feel like bubbles are almost perfect ellipses wheres my characters are more like splattered droplets. I also considered that 'Droplets' was a satisfying 8 letter word that fit in comfortably in the exhibition.

Adding some minor comments and updating thumbnail.
