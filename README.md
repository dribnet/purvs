## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Update 4

I thought that this addition was successful as long as I can successfully input these silhouttes without them taking focus over the photographs own narrative. To test this better Äª resized and repositioned the sillhouttes to act as if they are currently working on the paintings, this can be seen most successfully in artwork_2. However once I input the grey colour code, it will recognise the silhoutte as a different tone and won't simply draw as black which it is currently doing. 

The code was also edited to be cleaner, using the rectangle grid code.
