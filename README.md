## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

This readme is for part 3. For this, I have decided to proceed with my 3rd face choice of the non-representational. 

I have chosen certain parameters to proceed with for this project. These are how many polygons there are in the face, the alpha value/ blending of colours in the face and the amount of features the face has.

The face also has ceratin random values on the vertices for the polys at this stage which I will control in the next part.
