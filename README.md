I have now finished the letters. I changed the default to the three triangles used to make each letter and number. I decided to get rid of the background and having no fill in two of the triangles. I tried to keep a rule of having one filled triangle in each letter and if possible use it in the middle of the letter. I also made it so that the letters now transition better.

Parameters per letter:

V1x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle 1.
V1y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle 1.
V2x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle 1.
V2y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle 1.
V3x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle 1.
V3y : y position of vertex 3 on triangle 1.
V4x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle 2.
V4y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle 2.
V5x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle 2.
V5y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle 2.
V6x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle 2.
V6y : y position of vertex 3 on triangle 2.
V7x : x position of vertex 1 on triangle 3.
V7y : y position of vertex 1 on triangle 3.
V8x : x position of vertex 2 on triangle 3.
V8y : y position of vertex 2 on triangle 3.
V9x : x position of vertex 3 on triangle 3.
V9y : y position of vertex 3 on triangle 3.
