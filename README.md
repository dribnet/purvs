## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

This README should be updated as the code changes. Replace
this placeholder text and use this
README as a design journal to record your process.
Be sure to use complete sentences,
and you can reference your sketch which will appear above.
The explanation should be short but complete, roughly 100 words.

Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
preview.jpg (960x500) and thumbnail.png (230x120).

For this exercise, I have decided to try make a few of the members of the band, KISS, as they are very recognisable. So far I have created vars for black and white and started a function to create a black star.
