I started this project by pulling across my face drawing code from PS1. I knew I wanted to emulate this same abstract style again, but using the landmarks we would receive to adjust how the previously randomly selected components would be rendered.

Because my initial face designs were very abstract, it was a bit of a struggle trying to use the landmark positions to draw certain facial components - the head and jaw outlines were one of my main struggles, and I used many different landmarks to calculate where some of the points would be (brow, eye, chin and nose positions).

Once the design was finalised, I was able to start working on training the faces. I set up four slider properties that I would use to train my faces. These are: Head Shape, Jaw Shape, Mouth Shape, and Cheek Colour. Head Shape is used to represent the height of the forehead, while Jaw Shape is used to represent the width of the jaw. Each of these has three discrete options that can be used. When paired correctly, the combination of both shapes should be an abstraction of the overall face shape in the photo. Mouth Shape represents the expression of the person, mostly dictated by the openness of and emotion portrayed through the mouth (eg. happy/sad/indifferent). There is only two options for this (happy and sad/indifferent), however the landmarks will dictate the openness of the mouth, so each mouth is still unique even having only two options. The Cheek Color is my favourite property, as it lerps between a light pink and a dark maroon. The colour of the cheeks represents the femininity/masculinity of the face. Females with lots of makeup and hair done up would be assigned the extreme of light pink, while males with facial hair would be assigned the dark maroon. People in between were given a colour value somewhere in between.

I then used the Interpolate functionality in Neighbors mode to make sure that I was happy with how the faces were being rendered, and to check against other faces the program though were similar. After this, I saved all the training values. From there, I found 24 images I wanted to get landmarks for, and test my code against. Most of these are headshots from my football team, with some other friends and family mixed in. I found the femininity/masculinity recognition to be super effective, with the faces in group photos of males and females togther being recognised and drawn correctly.

My last steps were to check how often I could correctly guess the faces in TrainQui and ValidQuiz. Because it used similar images to give you the 4 options, I found the cheek colour was less useful than I thought it would be in helping me guess which face was correct. The mouth variable was actually the best, as you could clearly tell if your face was supposed to be smiling or not, which was a huge giveaway. I definitely found I was guessing correctly at least 60-70% of the time.
