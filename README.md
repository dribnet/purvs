## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

For the final composition I decided to create a scene to put the faces into context. The conveyer belt felt like a natural progression as the faces seem like a thing that would be pumped out in large quantities.

I would have loved for the final composition to be animated but this was beyond my skill level. Having more faces generated constantly as oppoesed to changing on a click. 

Overall I am happy with my composition.
