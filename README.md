I created an alphabet using the triangles, The process mostly included drawing out multiple ideas of how each letter could be arranged using triangles, Then selecting the ones I felt were easier to recognise. I also got input from people around me which helped in creating the letters. 

I would still like to go through and adjust the letter positions, e.g. where they sit on the y axis 

The colours where chosen from a moroccon colour palette as the triangle form of the letter looks tiled.
