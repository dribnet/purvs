## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The beads have been slightly updated. 
- The border has been removed
- They change brightness based off of how bright the pixel they represent is. 

The grid is remains the same as before. 

Im not so sure I like how the beads are looking, in the last iteration they felt apart of the grid. Now, the image is disjointed, it is just a grid with squares onto and Iâ€™m not sure I like it much.
