Binary Clock

When playing with string manipulation of the time objects, I found that there was an option to convert strings to binary. In finding that, I decided to make a clock that would display time in a binary representation with LED-like lights. Having been the first time I had used P5.js I wanted to see how it would handle images, so I decided to implement most of the elements as such.

Seeing as how I was digging into the technical aspects of the platform, the work came out a bit more rigid than I would have liked. Looking back now, I would have added smoother animations and value changes.
