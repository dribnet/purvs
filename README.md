#The Calm of Nature's Palette
The waterfront means a lot to me, as a landscape architecture major, as it represents a significant change in the urban design philosophy the world over. It also feels tranquil to me and I frequent the waterfront as a place to enjoy the outside.<br/>
My other two photos are of areas I have lived in. The first is a view from a hill  from where I grew up. It was taken during the quarantine and seems very serene and far from civilisation despite being in the middle of it.<br/>
The second is a sunset in Newtown It invokes a warm and comforting feeling and I thought it was neat so I took a picture of it
<br/> They are all in different locations and depict vastly different geography except they all have seemingly one colour palette and manifest similar emotions in me when I look at them.

Realised that we weren't supposed to put development log in the README, so all information was moved to `CommitLog.md`

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [Pointillism Example done in p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
