## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My theme is based around friendship and the values different people teach you. I have worked on my background imagery the most and I am pretty happy with the outcome. I am still trying to create much more depth in my masks but am getting the hang of it. I wanted the backgrounds to be quite out of focus to really make the people in the images the focus, as the are the subject of the photos and represent the theme. 

I need to work on what shape to use for the people and how I will create more depth and clarity there, even though I am not too worried on their features being shown perfectly because I want to add symbols which represent the different values they have taught me, which is more the focus of the image.

I am still to take the right third picture to use but it will likely be a collection of polaroids will nature themes involved behind them or around them.
