## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Overview

I chose to draw my alphabet using a serise of 4 looped lines and a black square that either appears in the center of the letter form or does not. All of my letters are square and drawn in black on a white square background. I used the loop lines to make an interpretation of the shape of each letter, and the black square either appears or does not based on weather or not the capital version of the letter, or the number, has a closed area of the shape (ie. ABDOPQR46890). I named my font ABAKAX. I wanted my name to be mathmatical because I think it has a mathmaticle look, and I wanted it to feature the letter A because it's my favorite of my letter forms. These parameters made me think of the word abacus. I used to take Latin and I know that abacus is a latin word so I looked up the etemology of the word and found that one of it's roots is the greek word abax. I then kind of combined abacus and abax and used a k to make the word feel even more sharp and angular because I felt it fit with the font. My font uses these 12 parameters
 "lpV1" Three parameters to control my verticle angled lines.
 "lpV2"
 "lpV3"

 "lpH1" Three parameters to control my horizontal angled lines. 
 "lpH2"
 "lpH3"

 "lpV1st" Two parameters to cntrol my verticle straight lines. 
 "lpV2st"

 "lpH1st" Two parameters to control my horizontal straight lines.
 "lpH2st"

 "mid" A parameter to control the demensions of my center black square.
 "space" A parameter to control the spacing of the looped lines.

 I have set my exibition to first show the name of my font, then my name, and then to transition to a few words I think relate to my font and my birthday. My default letter is my fonts version of the percent symbol, %. 

 Process

 My initial idea for my font was pretty different than what I eventually landed on as you'll see if you take a look at my first few sketches. This is because I was initially confused as to how all the parameters would be used when drawing the letters and my first idea would have included way too many parameters. My initial plan was to use the minimal number of lines needed to draw a letter form, in a square format and to only be able to draw lines between the four corners and the center of each line of a square. I also had the plan to use a square in the middle as I eventually did in this final format.

 When I realized my initial plan would not work the way I thought it would I transitioned to the idea of using for loops. I was inspired by the first reading where they showed student work that had been able to get a lot of detail using for loops while not actually drawing many shapes. I still wanted to use a limeted number of lines so I started working with 4 looped lines which could be horizontal, verticle, andgled, or straight. I still limited where these lines could be placed just to give myself more ruels to work with. I thought that would give my font a more consistent look. I played around with using color in my sketches but I quickly decided that just using black and white had a dramatic quality I really liked and I felt that it allowed my letter forms to speak for themselves in a way. Just using black in whit also helped my letters feel a bit more like a real font.

 When I got to the point of interpolating my letters and setting up my exibition there was an immediate problem. Because I had not used certin lines or the square in a lot of my letters rather than those elements transitioning between one another they just appeared. Some parts of my letters were trsnsitioning and other parts were just popping up out of no where. I tried to think of a way around this like having the lines I wasn't using transparent but I couldn't think how to do it for a few days. When I finally figured it out I felt like a huge idiot. I could just make the position of all my unused lines be at the 0 line of my square so they would appear from the sides when the letters changed and I could have my square be drawn with demensions of 0,0 so it grew from the middle. This was a really simple fix and I felt really silly it took me so long to think of, but there you go.

 After I had the interpilation figured out I just polished off a few things like finalizing what words I wanted my exibition to say and fixing a few charecters I thought were weird. I would watch my exibition and try to read the words and change whichever forms jumped out at me for not making sense.

 Conclusion

 I really like the way my font turned out and I think it's a really great example of my work. I've always found that serize of lines like this have sort of a space age or tecno future feel that I like how they gave my letter forms a sense of depth or space. I'm really proud of how my letters are able to have so much interesting detail while being really simple. I liked how we were able to explore the interaction between multiple different files as that is something that I havn't gotten to explore before. Now that I have some experience in it I would definetly want to work in this format more.
