## PS2 MDDN 242 2019

Added interpolation and interaction thing from part 4 but the function interpolate_letter doesn't work and I don't really know where to put it. Also in interaction.html it cuts off the bottom of some of my letters even though they stay within the boxes.

The 16 parameters per letter:
  * `Yshift1` : top of line position for first line
  * `Yshift2` : top of line position for second line
  * `Yshift3` : top of line position for third line
  * `Yshift4` : top of line position for fourth line   

  * `length1` : length bottom of line position for first line
  * `length2` : length bottom of line position for second line
  * `length3` : length bottom of line position for third line
  * `length4` : length bottom of line position for fourth line


  * `Xquad1` : x position of first quad point
  * `Xquad2` : x position of second quad point
  * `Xquad3` : x position of third quad point
  * `Xquad4` : x position of fourth quad point

  * `Yquad1` : y position of first quad point
  * `Yquad2` : y position of second quad point
  * `Yquad3` : y position of third quad point
  * `Yquad4` : y position of fourth quad point
