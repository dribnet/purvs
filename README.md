PS1 MDDN 342 2017

For face number one I wanted to explore how far basic features could be pushed without losing the objective beauty of the face. I used a cartoon aesthetic in order to avoid a creepy, uncanny valley situation. If I take this idea further, I would like to look more into the golden ratio and what variances can be allowed within it without distorting the features beyond recognition as a face. 

For my second face, I wanted to create something closer to my own drawing style, which heads more in the direction of realism. It's far from finished, but I figured I would do more of a 'proof of concept' type thing rather than try to resolve the design immediately. With this face, I wanted to explore the idea of parameterised emotion. I do a fair bit of 3D modelling, and so the techniques behind facial rigging and blend shapes were something that have been playing on my mind. I wanted to familiarize myself with parameterised expression in 2D in order that my 3D work is better informed. If I take this concept further, I will add more features (mouth, nose, etc), and also rework the parameters so that each slider controls one of the 4 core emotions). I would also like to develop the visual style in order that it better reflects my own art style, with reference to sketchy lines and maybe even hatched shading. 

For the third section of the canvas, I wanted to hone in on some detail, and really focus on tweaking and developing the eyes, as they are the feature I would like to focus on while designing my faces.
