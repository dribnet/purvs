## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Final Read me:

I found this project a little easier to do as I decided to limit myself and keep my ideas as simple as possible.

As seen in pervious commits I restricted myself to only 3 elements in my design, a semi-circle and two lines. 
This idea arose from my avid love for knitting (and I was knitting at the time that the project started).

I found working with the arcs rather simple although I found the starting angle and end angle, while not important with a static character, with the animation was particularly important as I was only thinking in positive numbers until the very end where I remembered negative numbers also work with the arch. 

I'm a little sad that I wasn't able to make it look as fancy as some other people's work as I find coming up with itterative ideas quite difficult and even tho keeping myself restrained made the design much easier to create, I felt that in comparison to some of my peers work it was still quite dull and some what empty. 

Coding the characters is the least of my problems as it merely takes time and I'm already readily equipt with the ability to create the shapes but it's the design that always gets me. I think next time I need more direction in how I'm going to design it. I always feel like I'm thrown over board with these design elements as I feel that I have no beginners knowledge on where to start or how to start and the process to get from point A to point B.
