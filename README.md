## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have modified my code to the example that Tom did in our pervious lecture. My design is now more uniform. I dont like this effect too much as it doesn't really show what the image is. I liked the way my design looked previous, where the squares and ellipses were over lapping each other.
