## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Main Concept:

Create an alphabet inspired by the Bauhaus typography from the 1920's. This type style foucsed on geometric shapes, vibrant colours, balanced layouts with harmony and sans-serif letters in upper case. In my type I am wanting to create this style through using 3 simple shapes, a semi-circle, a line and a full circle. Each shape has a different colour similar to the Bauhaus type.


The ten parameters per letter:

- circDiam: the size of the circle
- CircleX: the x position of the circle
- CircleY: the y position of the circle 
- lineX: x position of the rectangle 
- lineY: y position of the rectangle 
- lineH: height of the rectangle 
- lineW: width of the rectangle 
- flipX: Arc x to swap numerical value with y
- flipY: Arc y to swap numerical value with x
- StrokeW: Changes the thickness of the line


I have experimented with changing the yellow arc into a triangle. I thought this shape made more sense for my bauhaus design as previously I had used 2 arc's, with one a semi-circle, and the other a full circle. I also added in stroke weight and opacity to give a more a defined shape outline.
