README for part3.

This is the training step. 
I have added features to make the faces appear silly but also incorporating elements from the devil so I can portry well known, serious and maybe slightly evil characters in a way that makes fun of them. Elements such as horn length and colour, hair size, head shape, mouth size, eye size and direction and whether a moustache is present are all being trained to hopefully react to the imageplaced in the file.
