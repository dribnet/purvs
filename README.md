### Updated clock with ellipses and current time

<<<<<<< HEAD
I have finished my clock and abstracted my original sketch idea and influenced it with the grandfather clock. The day and night cycles are mapped to hours which change colours depending on what time it is. The hours/mins/secs/mils are also mapped to the size of the screen and the alarm function flashes when active.
=======
I have improved the day/night cycles to include a mapped sun and moon go across the screen. I have also made the clock more aesthetically pleasing, a few more touch ups and I should be complete. I haven kept the movement on the hours/minutes and seconds the same to portray the movement of a grandfather clock.
