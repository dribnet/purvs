## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this problem set, I'm thinking of doing something based on tradition as I feel like it'll have more meaning compared to something that isn't. This relates back towards one of the universities main message on telling a story with heritage. So far, I've updated one of the photos, and will update the rest in the next session.

Started doing my second image, quite happy with how it's looking currently. I figured out that I wanted to mask the textures on the 'saris' so that it makes it more clear for the user. This is potentially an image I'll be using for my final as I'm quite happy on how it looks on the page. Currently in terms of ideas, I'm still not entirely sure what my overall theme is, so I'm still gonna base my designs around Indian heritage until I decided of one. My next steps are to finish the masking texture on the second output, then start to think of some new ideas for the third image.

Filling mask2 to get more detail on the small things. I need to play more with the shapes in this problem set and figure out if there's more to this problem set (for example more shapes or playing around with colour schemes).

Image 2 has been completed and I'm quite happy with it. It shows a lot of textures from the two sari's (clothing) which is what I was aiming for. As mentioned before, I need to play around with the limitations that this problem set has to offer. Thumbnail has been set to the mask to show how much detail has been added.

After playing around with the grid code, I decided to use aspects of it into my second image and was amazed on how good it looks with the original code that I had. It incorporates both ellipses and rectangles in a pixel art way which looks really good to look at it. The code so far uses a nested for loop which tracks both the x and y pixels on the screen, and on the side of that, it uses another for loop which adds ellipses depending on where the white space is on the mask. If I further refined image2, I could potentially use it as one of my final designs. I'm now currently working on the 3rd design, which is something to do with nature, but I'm not quite sure what message to send at this stage.
