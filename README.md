## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I had a go at layers. At first I used the tile example in the tutorial, which gave a super clear image. I did like it but it wasn't what I had in mind. I was aiming for more artistic, painting look. I wanted it to be detailed but still have some visible strokes. I changed the rect to a line, and also experimented with having the layer changing opacity depending on the colour of the mask. But this resulted in some very chunky transitions which I didn't quite like.
As of now, I am happy with how it looks, I need to clean up my masks so they're more detailed. I asked for some feedback from my roommates and they think it looks very artsy. 

I've taken images from a recent visit to the Auckland Botanical Gardens, this place is very special to me. I absolutely love nature and landscapes. I feel that after the long amount of time we all spent indoors, it's nice to remember just how peaceful and beautiful our planet really is.
