## PS2 MDDN 342 2017

Transitioning my drawing style from PS1 into this Problem Set proved a rather challenging task. I was determined to maintain the cartoon aesthetic, however I had to comprimise certain design features to allow for more approprirate mapping of the faces.

I spent a long time considering whether I should choose a different art style, to allow more accurate and emotive face mapping. I considered my alternative drawing styles from PS1 as well as a very simple white outline style. However, in the end I felt that although these may have mapped mroe accurately to the faces, thematically they were not as strong as my 1920's cartoon street art design.

I reapproached the mapping process, considering potential methods that could help to make translating the cartoon art style onto the faces a bit easier. The biggest sacrifice I had to make was having both eyes placed in front of the face. This made the mapped character appear much more accurate, however I felt that in doing this I lost some aspect of the charm of the original design. I looked at 'grouping' certain features and bulk translating them to certain landmark points. This worked very well, and helped to keep the features cohesive across different facial structures.

Eventually I was able to map out my design across all the provided faces. I then started to consider variables I could adjust to help bring identity and distinction to each individual face.

The most influential trait I brought in was to key the original hair colour to the body colour of the character design. This brought in the most uniqueness and helped to more strongly differentiate characters.

I also introduced an alternative style for male and females. I was quite surprised at how well the system was able to interpolate gender after only a handful of trained examples.

I also introduced eye lid heights and look direction to help bring a further refinement to the adjustable variables.

For my selected images I originally wanted to use various images of brightly haired punks. I felt his would create an array of interesting an uniquely coloured characters. However, since the trained photos did not have much brightly coloured hair this did not end up working like I had hoped it would. Instead I opted to use photos of New Zealand street artists. I felt this created an intersting narrative of overlaying a character inspired by the work of the people it was overlayed onto. 

For the most part the system was able to identify key elements of these new photos, such as gender. However, it did struggle to accurately capture hair colour in some cases.

Overall I am happy with what I managed to produce. I feel that I was able to transfer my original art style into this Problem Set and overcome the challenges this created.
