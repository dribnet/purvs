A ball animation where the ball follows a trajectory set by the user using the sliders, the distance is a constant set by msyself, where it moves & turns around when it gets to the other end

Initially I was calculating the equation of the line using y=mx+c but then i found that p5.js has vector methods so I changed it to use vectors(as this is much easier).
I have put a lot of detail into the placement of the lines (trajectories) to make the shapes, as this has an impact on teh overall look since the orientation & overlapping of the lines makes a difference.
