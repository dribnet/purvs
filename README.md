## Powers of 10 PRINT

I have figured out how to put random fill for each square. But it randomizes everytime you zoom which isn't really what I want. Therefore I might just change my design to something else. Also the grid colors aren't really exactly in line. 

More detail has also been added into the third zoom layer/zone.
