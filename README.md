## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The code has been modified using Tom's code to make the output more uniform and tidy. I like how the squares sit/fit tightly against one-another. The circles, however, I like a little less because of the white space they have inbetween each other. I think I will next try the different codes until I find one that creates an output I like and then I will try to edit it further to make it more my own style.
