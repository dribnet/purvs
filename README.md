So far I've exhausted my parameters and use all 20. They are the following

The three parameters per letter:
  * "posx" : X position of the rectangles
  * "posy" : Y position of the rectangles
  *	"pos2x" : X position of the smaller triangle
  * "pos2y" : Y position of the smaller triangle
  *	"pos3x" : X position of the larger triangle
  * "pos3y" : Y position of the larger triangle
  * "pos4y" : X position of both arcs
  *	"pos4y" : Y position of both arcs
  * "arcS": Start of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arcE": End of the smaller arc in radians
  * "arc2S" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  * "arc2E" : Start of the larger arc in radians
  *	"recA" : X-coordinate/size of both rectangles
  *	"recB" : Y-coordinate/size of both rectangles
  *	"triX2": first X-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2": first Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triY2A" : second Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2A" : second X-coordinate of each triangle
  * "triY2B" : third Y-coordinate of each triangle
  *	"triX2B" : third X-coordinate of each triangle
