## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I was not too happy how my images looked and my theme in general was not very cohesive between the 3 images. So i decided to take a step back to a another idea i had near the start of the project but alter that again. I'm going to take 3 photos of 3 good mates of mine. All following the same style image, but create masks for the different layers of clothing. then take the photos on a really colourful background to make the background to pop with colour. I experimented this with a image of me and a mate to see how it would look with the code i have at the moment, then i played around the code further to create a new view of it.
