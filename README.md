As my first idea, I've decided to represtent my letters using the braille writing system. Each letter in braille  is made up of a six cell dot. The letter paramters are simply indicative of if each dot is showing or not in the cell. If the number next to the parmater is a one that implies that cell is showing. Otherwise if the dot is a zero it indicates that the cell is not used for that letter.  

The three parameters per letter:
  * `dot1` : The first dot of braille cell.
  * `dot2` : The second dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot3` : The third dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot4` : The fouth dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot5` : The fith dot of braille cell. 
  * `dot6` : The sixit dot of braille cell.
