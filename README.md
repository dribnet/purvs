This is the final version of the alphabet. The alphabet is very plain, wanting to focus on readablility over expressionism. The letters that make up the font are all straight lines of a set weight, not lending any part of the letter more importance than another. The only exception to this is the decoration that adorns most of the letters. This is there to add both some uniqueness to the latters, but also as a way to use the final line that some letters do not need to utilize. 

I chose this design as I am fond of the function over form ideology as well as approaching my work with a minimalistic mindset. These two things combined lead to a simple alphabet thats easy to read and animated smoothly and easily. When it came to the olours, I wanted to match the calm feeling that was present in the font and as such, chose light orange with a very pale purple behind it as the background colour.
