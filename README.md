## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I added many polygons inside the main polygon, that are slightly transparent. For this iteration I made the mask shown as pure white. The transparency within the polygons gives the white an almost glowing effect.

I changed the first mask by making a thick outline around the flowers (so it would be clearly seen).
