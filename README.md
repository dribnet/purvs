## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I've some editing, and mostly fixed my bugs. I like what I've got now I just need to think about how to perfect it. The whole American flag picture feels a little angsty but it actually a decoration in my room. I grew up in a house that used to be a one room school and when my parents bought it there was this old American flag in the basement that used to hang on the flag pole. I've been using it as a curtain cause I thought it looked cool and it lets in a really nice amount of light. Last time I went home I grabbed it so I could have something to remind me of home but now it feels like an odd thing to have hanging in my room. It's a constant reminder of everything going on and that I'm not home.
