## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

A fun preview of my alphabet! the code is super messy and definetly not the most clean and reasonable way of doing it because I got really confused at how everything was working at first and then by the time I figured it out everything was already all messy but I get it now so I should be all good for the real deal. The idea is tht I'm drawing my letters using the base lines with a square as a base. Lines can connect between the four corners and the centers of each of the squares lines to create the letters. Everytime there is a closed off shape in a letter there is a blue square in the center. I'm not sure on the color theam yet, I usually just use really basic colors at first and then refine a theam later. Also I know the A looks like a tecno elder wand. That was unintentional.
