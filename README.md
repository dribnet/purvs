Going into this project my first step has been to do some research and start thinking of patterns and color schemes. So far, I've been inspired by the works of Holger Lippmann and the colour schemes used in his work. Next step is to keep developing the color scheme and start looking at patterns and shapes.

UPDATE

I've started looking further at the style and shapes to use for this project. I really like the idea of layering complex shapes under simplers ones so I'm currently trying to make progress with that.

UPDATE

I'm trying out a second concept and playing around with possibilities, I've been exploring what my background code can do, what I can do with the colour scheme and the shapes over top.

UPDATE 

Still trying to decide what path I want to go down with this projet, still trying out new things and bits of code but really enjoying the layering, still not certain on the colour scheme.
