### Overflow Clock

Initially the concept of the clock was to 'overflow' the user with information whilst still presenting the current time differentiated. This was a play on the capacity of information as well as the mundane and simple design of a classic digital clock. This goes further overboard with the alarm. As the alarm goes off, every number is filled red until the minute itself is up. Although the current time may not be draw over the minute in which the alarm goes off, the indication of the current time is still present. 
The design is not intended to be confusing but rather present the viewer with information that is not needed or not necessary and still upon a random chance (once per minute or every 60 seconds at least) draw the current time in a varrying color.
