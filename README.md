## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My chosen theme for this project is photos I have re-created during lockdown within my flat. The idea stems from the boredom we all felt during lockdown and being away from our parents and friends. I want to take a sort of psychedelic approach to the editing of the photos in the custom pixel, which i feels represents the sort of emotions me and my flatmates were feeling, as we began to go stir crazy in our small flat.
