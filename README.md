## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme that I am thinking of using at the moment is promotion of local nz music. I have a lot of friends who are incredible musicians, releasing great music, and I feel that they deserve to have their images on a billboard (especially with the state of the post-covid live music scene). I've used my original photos of artists (2 local -Gajuar and The Butlers, 1 international - Brockhampton). Going forward, I want to focus a lot on Gajur (Cathal Dickson) - he's a really close friend, is about to release an ep, and I do a lot of visual art for him. I used 1 black and white image, just to see what it looks like, and I like it- the increased contrast means its a bit easier to make out what the image is.
