## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two triangles and one rectangle The size of the 3 shapes is controlled by sixteen parameters.

The sixteen parameters per letter:
  * triX1: first x point for peach triangle
  * triY1: first y point for peach triangle
  * triX2: second x point for peach triangle
  * triY2: second y point for peach triangle
  * triX3: third x point for peach triangle
  * triY3: third y point for purple triangle
  * ptX1: first x point for pink triangle
  * ptY1: first y point for pink triangle
  * ptX2: second x point for pink triangle
  * ptY2: second y point for pink triangle
  * ptX3: third x point for pink triangle
  * ptY3: third y point for pink triangle
  * rectL: length of rectangle
  * rectW: width of rectangle
  * rectX: x point of rectangle
  * rectY: y point of rectangle


04052020 for this  i changed the colours, having a play around with the two ovals and the background. I then changed the shapes from using ircle to oval by changing some of the primative used. 

08052020 i have started to play around with how i would do the alphbet, what i liked using was triangles. with playing around with ideas, i couldn't figure out the best way to do some of the letters such as an E. so i found to be able to do this was by ading a line.

11052020  now that having found my idea, i couldnt figure out how to do the triagles, so after asking for help, i was able to make the triangle. after  was able to get one done it was easier to get the second on done.

11052020 having now figured out how to do the triangles, i started to move on an do the draw letter code. at first it took a while to figure out what to do, but got there in the end. For my alphabet i have 3 shapes - 2 triangles and 1 rectangle, with these three shapes i was able to do all the letter and the numbers

13052020 today i was able to finish to off the alphabet, and strated to play around with the colours, though I'm thinking i might change the colours again 

16052020 Today I did interpolation, and now when the letters change it is done soomthly 

17052020 After having done the code side of it all, i started to play around with the colours. I found the clours i had chosen didn't really work the way i wanted them to. So now i have gone for more watermelon colours. I also made it that there was no stroke as i found the stoke runied the letters.

20052020 With having finished most of my code, I asked for some feedback regrading my design. the feedback i was given was to make that thee was a space around the rectangle so it would constant for each of my letters and my numbers. How I did this was by making the changing the stoke weight and colour for the rectangle. I increased the stroke weight to 4, and made the stoke colour the same as the background.
