### clock final

This is the final iteration of my clock, the colours are no longer over powering or plain. when the alarm is activated the pattern on the clock face spins at the speed milliseconds are counted which creates a cool effect that is really hard to miss. the time is synced correctly now witht he hour hand acting as a 12 hour clock and the circle acting more as a 24 hour indicator.
