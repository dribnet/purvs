### circle and square

My idea is to use some regular graphics to generate my clock like this picture that is constiuted from nine circles and I also make these circles to become a square. There is a reason that is a sentence from my country which is nothing can be accomplished without norms or sandards and in my opinion, the rules is from the circles and square.
