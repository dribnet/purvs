I was realise my old idea of kidtoy have too many parameters for each alphabet on it. I decided to change my idea relate to a flower. My idea of alphabets are a dandelion. Because, I'm a personally who love flowers. I decided to use a green and white color with contrast on the pink background. I'm starting set them by bezier() coded to draw a stalk of the flowers. I used other functinon to set a darwpart called "function drawPart()". I set the parameters for changing a form of the part called "change". If I want my alphabet's part be a curve or a v shaped, I set them in "else if()" function.

I used 12 parameters for each alphabet so far.
► "positionX1": 0, // set to move the part 1 by X axis
► "positionY1": 0, // set to move the part 1 by Y axis
► "tilt1": 0, // set to rotate the part 1 
► "change1": 1, // set to change into another form of the part 1 by // 1 : original form // 0 : curve form // 2 : v shaped // 3 : arc shaped
► "positionX2": 0, // set to move the part 2 by X axis
► "positionY2": 0, // set to move the part 2 by Y axis
► "tilt2": 0, // set to rotate the part 2 
► "change2": 1, // set to change into another form of the part 2 by // 1 : original form // 0 : curve form // 2 : v shaped // 3 : arc shaped
► "positionX3": 0, // set to move the part 3 by X axis
► "positionY3": 0, // set to move the part 3 by Y axis
► "tilt3": 0, // set to rotate the part 3
► "change3": 1, // set to change into another form of the part 3 by // 1 : original form // 0 : curve form // 2 : v shaped // 3 : arc shaped
