This README explains the randomised faces for part3.

I decided to continue with the sketchy face I made as I wanted to stay away from block colours and lines. I focused on making sets of faces that could be interchangable with each other, almost like an emoji. Each of the features randomly vary in length, height or width, and additionally, they all randomly match with others. This random generates a new face each time.
