## Final

The theme of my alphabet is autumn leaves, using two leaf shapes, one twig and a negative space circle to draw the letters. I like that my alphabet is easily readable due to the silhouettes of the shapes I chose to use for my design, which I developed further by experimenting with negative space. I also like the autumnal colour scheme which I incorporated into my design in the later stages to create a more cohesive theme that influenced the exhibition and negative space developments. I ended up keeping the animations as straight maps of my parameters because I liked how the different elements moved smoothly into the shape of the next letter, and I just had to be careful in how I was drawing the rotation of the leaves so they weren't flipping around more than 360 degrees when they didn't need to. 

Some restrictions I found challenging was the 100x200 bounding box for the letters as I had to squish some of the letters together more than I had initially planned. I also restricted my design by not changing the size of the leaves and twig. This was mostly not a problem except for the G and K which could have benefitted by being able to change the twig length and some letters like E, I, R and X could have benefitted by being able to change the width of the leaves. I found the M and W to be a bit tricky with my shapes as well but I think they look a lot better with the negative space to show the points better. Overall I am happy with the look of my alphabet with these restrictions as they look like a cohesive set.

I used 13 parameters in my design;
	"offsetx": X position of the first leaf
    "offsety": Y position of the first leaf
    "leaf2Posx": X position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "leaf2Posy": Y position of the second leaf in relation to the first leaf
    "rotate1": rotation angle of the first leaf
    "rotate2": rotation angle of the second leaf
    "rotate3": rotation angle of the stick
    "stickPosx": X position of the stick in relation to first leaf
    "stickPosy": Y position of the stick in relation to first leaf
 	"circlex": X position of the negative space circle in relation to first leaf
    "circley": Y position of the negative space circle in relation to first leaf
    "circlew": width of the negative space circle circle
    "circleh": height of the negative space circle circle
