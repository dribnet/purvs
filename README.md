I have added in the editor.js and edited it to work with my letters.js and drawletter.js
It is definitely making the process of getting the variable numbers easier which is really cool as i can experiement and go deeper into the shapes im able to create.
I have changed the stroke lines to white as i really want to emphasise the triangles and not so much the lines.
I might change the stroke size later on.
