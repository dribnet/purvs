## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


I decided it was time to try some new photographs for my theme. In particular I want something that has a plainer background that I can get quite creative with, & a simply outlined foreground shape so that it can be abstracted a bit more as well, while it's still clear what the image is portraying. In terms of theme I was looking for something outdoors as the enviroment is very important to me, & if possible involved people having fun. This is actually a photo I took over summer of my boyfriend playing with a soccer ball at the beach. I think it fits well with the requirements i have, & I definietely think I can develop it into a theme with the way I manipulate the pixels & the other images I include. I have hundreds of similar photos from the same day so plenty to pick from.

- I tried giving the background a more linear style, so that the foreground felt more full. I created the background using the noise funcion to make a series of random points that are all connected by a line. The interesting thing about this method is that the outcome varies quite a large amount depending on the noise seed. It also created quite a few interesting patterns at times.

I added a few gradient changes to the foreground, gives it sort of an embossed feel, but it doesn't fit with the background.

Tried using smartmask. It worked well at selecting indivdual objects, but I can get a much clearer selection using photoshop. There are some parts of the foreground that I would have preferred to be background but they were selected by smartmask
