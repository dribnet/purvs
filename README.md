## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Currently testing with the idea of creating 8 different shapes to show different in tones in the photos.

The idea to do show 2 places that I currently call home. The image on the left is shot at the waterfront in Wellington, New Zealand. The image on the right is shot at a decommissioned cross-country train track in Singapore. The image is the flags of the two nations.
