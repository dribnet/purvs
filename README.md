## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

The parachuters are now drawn infinitely in an irregular grid. I have made the spaces between them large because I don't want them to be cluttered at the initial view. 

I want them to display in a more irregular pattern like my ps3 so I need to play around with the offset values. I will also bring back the clouds in the background and some in the foreground to add some context.
