The final step was to edit the code to allow the grey coloured masks to be presented clearly, to do so I created four layers. One for each colour on my masked colours. I also created a fourth mask colour, dark grey, which was placed over the painted elements within each photograph. 

I then edited the tile step for each layer allowing me to adjust the resolution for each mask colour individually. The aim of this to show the important sections of the image to strengthen the message within the photographs. To do so I had the lowest tile step for the dark grey so the painted element was very clear and readible. The silhoutte was second lowest allowing it be recognizable and obviously part of the narrative.

In addition you can remove each layer in the code, and these black lines with still appear. To combat this I changed from rectangles to ellipses as this allowed the rectangle lines to not
