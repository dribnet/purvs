## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

Having a bit of trouble with interpolation. I have tried checking for bugs in my code but cannot seem to figure out where the problem is so I requested for assistance from my tutor.
---------------------------------------------
Finally completed the whole alphabet and numbers. I had to add a few more parameters in order to be able to form more letters and the numbers. The most challenging letters to create were S, X and Z. Also, most of the alphabet is resembles the lowercase English alphabet but a few of the letters in this alphabet, particularly, G, J and L look like the uppercase English letters. This was the easiest way to create them and make them distinct from other letters.

---------------------------------------------
I ended up having to change the way my alphabet looks because I got stuck on the letter D with the way I was previously forming the letters. I am still using the line and 2 rounded rectangles for the letter formation but I've had to add "letterRotation" as another parameter to be able to get more variations to make the letters.

I used the editor to see what each letter would look like and then plugged in the data for each letter from there into the letters.js file. I managed to get through all the letters except S, V, X & Z; which I am finding quite challenging to create. One big problem that I have at the moment is that the letters in the alphabet are not showing the way they were showing in the editor. The second rounded rectangle is not appearing in the right place for each letter, which is a bit frustrating. I may need help figuring out why that is happening.

---------------------------------------------
Alphabet updated up to the letter D. The next ones going forward a bit of a challenge at present. Still need to do some more thinking.

Finally managed to sort out the code. I had to add another rounded rectangle which has the same colour as the background, which is cutting through the first rectangle in order to form the letter C.


Still trying to sort out my code to draw the letters in the form I want. I'm using a line and rounded rectangle to draw the letters. At the moment my code doesn't seem to be working so I need to figure out a way forward so that I can update my thumbnail and sketch.



First time working on this Project 2. I changed a few things about the sketch using the same code. Changed darkBlue fill to pink. Changed space between letters from 250 to 200. Changed strokeWeight from 4 to 6.
