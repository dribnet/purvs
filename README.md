## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Iteration:

Continuing iteration and refinement of my last commit. Since  I created my code over summer I feel it is hard to show process with the code/technical so I really wanted to focus on a good output of my images with an addition of masks and pre-processing of the images to have a more controlled output and showing the process of refining my output.

I have continued to experiment with different masks, pre-processing techniques and changing the parameters of the variables and have found these 3 selected iterations came out with more interesting results for an output over the other iterations and that is why I have selected these three.

I have been trying to keep my masks similiar to my constantly changing and developing narrative. I'm still trying to relate it to the ocean through the aesthetic of using the perlin noise algorithm and want to somehow show depth in the image through incorporating an interpretation of the Ta-Va theory as a visual. My interpretation of the Ta-Va theory is the ocean is the thing that connects us to each other. For instance the polynesian islands are all seperated through the ocean it is the thing that seperates the islands but through travel over the ocean it is the thing that connects the islands. The ocean is something that disconnects but it is also the thing that connects us. For my output images I want to try show the disconnection and connection of the ocean represented by perlin noise and manipulating and controlling the generative side of it more towards my narrative. I've wanted to keep the elements quite generative and natural like the ocean. 

For the outputs in these images i've tried to visually show my narrative more with considerations of my masks so i've spent more time remaking masks and trying different parameters than I have on the technical part of this assignment. For the mask I created it by playing around in the brush settings and creating a fluid pattern from the custom brush, editing the preset of the brush as I made the pattern. The pattern created an effect of dense blocks of image/colour and wispy lines of perlin noise. The output has a bit of depth to the image through the placement of the density and opaque.

For the second image I created the mask by duplicating the image and making it black and white and then using the eraser tool to remove the parts where there was a nice colour on the black and white image by doing this when I run my code the nice colours would be rendered denser, to do this I duplicated the black and white image again and made this one into a mask. I merged the other one with the colour image so that it had nice colours and black and white. Creating the effect in the image of dense nice colour lines and grey wispy lines. 

For the third image I believe I used the mask from the first image but had parameters to have more of a perlin noise influence across the image so it doesn't have really dense blocks. This image is more similar to my other images that I have committed so for continuation sake I will probably use this as one of the final images but I am quite conflicted as I also really like the contrast between the density and opaque in the first image which I think better shows the disconnection and connection aspect I think it is more visually impactful because of the contrast rather than the continuing 'wispyness' in the third image.
