## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

Initial Concept:

My thrid project was based arounf clusters of roses, so for this project I want to zoom in on the petals. I did some google imaging to look at what rose petals looks like under a microscope and it looks like a whole bunch of textured, organic circles. I want to try replicate this pattern in this project. The most zoomed out version will just be dense clusters of roses, and as you zoom in they start to spread out a bit more, and then it gets to a point where you start to see some texture appearing on the outer petals, and then you get even closer and the texture is clear and covering all petals of the rose
