Lego Faces

Randomised the turning to add variation, with the heads staying for 2-10 seconds currently

Added some animation to the heads so they appear to be rotating and changing to a new face as they rotate. This will need to be optimized and I plan on only rotating faces at certain intervals and having the code do the rotation rather quickly.

The mouths have also been updated a fair bit with some work still needing to be done to get them to a place I would like.

I also need to go through and explore the focus of focusRandom, to give the faces a distribution that is more realistic. As well as continuing to add extra details to futher explore this distribution.
