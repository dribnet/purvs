## PS2 MDDN 242 2018 Colours
   
I tested out another idea, but this time I played around with the opacity. I gave both arcs a fill and made them both transparent slightly. Then for the stroke I made the out transparent and the inner solid. I think that the dark grey stroke on the inner arc is a bit harsh and stands out too much. I like the transparency on the outer arc stroke I think it looks pretty interesting. So far out of all of them I like this one and the black and white on the best.

pos3y this draws the y position of the second point 
arcAngle is the size of the arcs for both arcs
