## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

9/06/2020

This is my final submission I'm really happy with how everything turned out and my idea that I needed to add some solid chunks of colour didn't turn out to be right I think because I think everything looks great how it is.

The most challenging part about this assignment was trying to get a painterly effect and also maintain detail which I think would be a standard problem for anyone trying to get a painterly affect with code.

I chose to go with this style because I thought that It fit my theme the best and conveyed the right emotions that I wanted to portray that I felt when I used to go on walks when I was younger.

I enjoyed playing around with my two different mask colours towards the end of the assingment and if I had a bit more time I would have played with this a bit more. Like how would it turn out if I actually painted over different areas with a lot of detail in photoshop and then used code to fill the detailed painting in with different effects?
