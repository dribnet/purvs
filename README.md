## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

This is my first sketch, just playing around really. My program draws two lines beside each other to create a very minimalistic font. One line is perfectly upright, and the other line leans. The line that leans is slightly thinner.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `lenA` : the length of the first line (line A)
  * `lenB` : the length of the second line (line B)
  * `leanB` : how much line B leans, or the x offset of it's top vertex
