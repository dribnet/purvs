### Block Clock

The initial idea I had for my clock was a simple geometric digital clock. With each unit being located on its own cube, the cubes would tip over to show the change in time, with this motion reflecting a ticking motion commonly associated with analog clocks.

I plan to have the motion for this clock similar to that of the gif linked below.
