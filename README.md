Sketch Ideas - 04/05/20

I did some research on different ways the alphabet can be presented. I found quite a few interesting way to show the alphabet but I picked 
a few to inspire my own alphabet. You can take a look at my sketches here: https://i.postimg.cc/j5WzFc29/mddn242-ideas.jpg

To make my alphabet a bit more unique I may combine a few of these concepts together. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
