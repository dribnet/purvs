For the first part I chose to take homer's face from the first promblem set and objectify it. It has variables
such as tilt_value, which changes how much the face is tilted. The second varibale is eye_value which controls
which direction homer's eyes are looking in, the third varable is mouth_value which controls the shape homer
makes with his mouth. The final variable is hair_value which controls the number of hairs on homer's head.I
chose the blue background as it is a complementary colour to homer's skin so looks nice, while providing
contrast.

For the second part I decided to move away from the simpsons as I felt the faces were too restricting and did
not allow enougth room to take parameters from the faces of real people. This was due to a couple of factors
the first being the side on oritation that I originally created them in. The second being the fact the shape of
the mouth and nose couldn;t really take much data from the faces other than position.

So I decided to base my design on Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot.
