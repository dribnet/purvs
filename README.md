So far ive been experimenting with removing shapes from a rectangle to create letters. Ive used a single curved rectangle with three circles placed to cut out and make letters. 

I tried to keep the variables to 6 by attaching the size variable for one of the circles to an if statement. However i needed more control so i added a single size variable to one of the circles. 

The parameters at the moment are 
  * `circle1x` : x position of the first circle
  * `circle1y` : y position of the first circle
  * `circle2x` : x position of the second circle
  * `circle2y` : y position of the second circle
  * `circle3x` : x position of the third circle
  * `circle3y` : y position of the third circle
  * `size` : radius of the first circle
