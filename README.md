## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

So I have slightly reworked the letters and their sizes to make things more consistant. However I am in a slight predicament. Currently the design feels a bit too basic and doesn't do a lot to seperate itself from other people who had the same sort of idea. I have the idea of having the Neon "Board" still visible but I need to still do some tweaks so that it doesn't make the whole thing look too messy. So curretly I am in the process of planning out the extra things to add:
	
	- Outer Glow which I hope to give a slight pulse effect 
	- Changing and fading colours

Current Paramters Are:
  * lines : an array of 1s and 0s that let the line algroithm know whether or not to "light up" or "turn on" a particular line
  * letterColour : Contains the letters colour
