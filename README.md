### Maeda Clock #2

I chose to recreate clock #2 from Maeda's 12 clocks as I liked the simplicity and aesthetic of the visual. I ellipses to code this clock, changing the colour and weight of the stroke to suit the style of the original. To take this further I could experiment with filling certain ellipses with colour, as well as playing with the stroke weight. The random or noise function could be useful in achieving this.
