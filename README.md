## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Added more letters and started making numbers. there are still a few letters that are going to be hard to make and will take a lot of figuring out to create. The letters that I am stuck on are: K, R, T, X, Y. The reason these letters are hard is because of my limited shapes too use to make them.

Currently I am sitting on a nice 10 parameters:
sizex
sizey
offsetx
offsety
cirsize1
cirsize2
ciroffsetx
ciroffsety
cir2offsetx
cir2offsety
