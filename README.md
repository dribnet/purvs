This README explains the faces for part5. 

My journey from part 1 to part 5 has successfuly refreshed me on what I had learned in creative coding 2 last year. 

I learned about beziers in part 2, and used the random function to have fun with a sketchy aesthetic.

In part 3, I re-iterated my first face, because I felt it could have the most points of randomness and still look nice.

Parts 4 and 5 were pretty much coded at the same time, the layout for part 5 came from fiddling around with multiplying and adding the i and j values to the x and y positions.
