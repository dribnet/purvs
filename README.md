An animated character sequence where the ball follows a trajectory set by a start postion & a 'directon' position, the distance is a constant set by msyself. Initally the ball was meant to move down the line & then come to a gradual stop, however this doesn't really make sense because it's weirdly half animated for only a second. Instead I thought the ball should continue in motion backwards & forwards along the line. 

Each letter is made out of three equal length lines that are calcualted using the x & y coordinated of the start position vector, & the x & y coordinates of the trajectory position vector. This is calculated using the linear algebra equation for a line going through two points. I calculate the position vector between the start & trajectory points, then normalize it to get the unit directional vector of the correct trajectory. I then move this unit vector back to the location of the starting coordinates & adjust it to be the correct length. I then draw the 100 circles along this line changing colour to give a smooth gradient, & the ball moves up & down the line changing direction when it gets to the end. 


Initially I was calculating the equation of the line using y=mx+c but then i found that p5.js has vector methods so I changed it to use vectors(as this is much easier) When the ball was going to stop at the end of the line I wanted to leave a trail behind it, so I was drawing using a for loop to make sure the ball draws every frame but to make it not look like just a line I had to make the trail change colour. At first I just did it changing through the whole rainbow because I wasn't sure what colour sequence I wanted to use. I eventually decided on a gradient from deep blue to a lighter blue. I had made a mistake in the file layout & was still writing my code in the style1 testing file. This made a challenge to reimport my code into the correct file but eventually I got it all working. However this also meant that all my saved character variables weren't the correct size. Because of this I spent most of my time coding just looking at a few characters I had done & I left the character formatting until the end. This worked well because the final part of my project really helped me decide on how to layout my characters. The final part was to make the ball move along the line. To begin with I was calculating its position on the line using some pretty confusing algebra, but then I realised that I could just use basically the same code as drawing the trail, but have a count outside of a for loop so that everytyhing doesn't redraw each frame. This worked as I had expected & I just had to adjust the speed to suit my aestheic (if the speed is set really high it looks similar to fairy lights). As I mentioned before, setting the values for the characters was one of the last things I did, but this was good because it allowed me to see how the animation will work with the characters. Since each end of the line is actually different the overalpping gradients create contrast where the lines meet so the orientation of the line is quite important & therefore the start & end points of the line need extra decisive precision. Instead of putting the lines end to end, I thought it looked best when they overlapped to establish more prominent edges. The moving ball adds yet another element to stylize my letters around. Since the ball moves at the same speed & the distances along each line are the same, it produces quite a satisfying feeling to watch. I tried to intentionally form the letters in a way that the balls would move in harmony with each other rather than just along their own lines. My personal favourites animation-wise are T, K, V, N, U, X &  0.
However, this animation-trajectory stuff did make things a little bit weird when it got to the interactive part of the assignment. I see that the breif states the characters should create 'sensible interpolations'. Of course while my interpolations aren't ridiculous, sometimes they aren't the most sensible option, due to one line having to flip right around rather than smoothly transition to the nearest line. I made the creative decision to (mostly) leave my lines as they were because the positioning was intentional to create the 'balance' between all the lines creating the letter.
