First sketch


I decided to change the example circles into two squares. I also changed the sketch to have a green colour scheme and took out the fill of the rects, colouring the stroke instead. The size and position of the first rectangle is fixed, but the location and size of the second rectangle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : diameter of the second rectangle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second rectangle relative to the first one
