Finished Alphabet/Working on numbers

Finished my alphabet and am currently working on my numbers.Only have two left to do.That is the 5 and 8 which is requiring a bit of extra thinking with my paremeters.After this I will look at the interpolation between letters.

The twenty parameters per letter:
  * "posx1": 
  * "posx2": 
  * "posx3": 
  * "posx4": 
  * "posx5": 
  * "posx6": 
  * "posx7": 
  
 * "triposx1": 
 * "triposx2": 
 * "triposx3": 

 * "posy1": 
 * "posy2": 
 * "posy3": 
 * "posy4": 
 * "posy5": 
 * "posy6": 
 * "posy7": 
 * "triposy1": 
 * "triposy2": 
 * "triposy3":
