## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


After getting the smoothed lines running i experimented with different ways of drawing the mosaics, particularly with a more painterly but detailed colour. I tried using random colours, while still maintaining the linework from the earlier iterations. It was interesting to see the visuals, however im not sure i like it as i want my final piece to look more like a stained glass window.
