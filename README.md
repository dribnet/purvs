This commit has A, B, and C showing on the index page.

I have also adjusted the size of the letters compared to the previous commit to better fit the guidlines in the brief.
If you access style1.html, you will also be able to edit the letters and access the inputs for A, B and C

The twelve parameters per letter: 
	Polygon1.x
	Polygon1.y
	Polygon1.scale
	Polygon1.sides
	Polygon2.x
	Polygon2.y
	Polygon2.scale
	Polygon2.sides
	Rectangle.x
	Rectangle.y
	Rectangle.scale
	Rectangle.angle
