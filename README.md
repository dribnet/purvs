## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Added the animation. I noticed that the line appears and disappears suddenly when going to or from a letter that has a line and one that does not. I might make the line fade in/out for this since transparency is used throughout my letters. 


The eight parameters per letter are now:

*posx1: first x position for the first circle
*posx2: second x position for the first circle
*posy1: first y position for the first circle
*posy2: second y position for the first circle
*linex1: first x position for the line
*linex2: second x position for the line
*liney1: first y position for the line
*liney2: second y position for the line
