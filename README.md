## PS1 MDDN 342 2017

To test the omniscience of nintendo's lawyers, I decided to make my recognisable faces to be those of the original Game Boys: Mario and Luigi.
Simplicity was the name of the game in this sketch; Mario's original sprite was designed to hide his hair and mouth to make him easier to animate, So I deigned to keep those hidden. I used only ellipses to make the faces to keep the shapes organic looking while remaining simple.

I have a distinct moustache planned for our greenest and least favorite  brother, as luigi has a stache with two segments as opposed to mario's 5-segmented caterpillar.
