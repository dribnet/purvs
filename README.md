## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The Ocean Bloom

I decided to add more pixels into the sketch file this time. 

I went for the somewhat water color look and made the pixels diamonds for the water. The pixels now lose star points as they transition from the foliage of the plants to the water.

On Tuesday I might try and make it look a tad cleaner before hand in.

"Water must be spoken too...you must be one with the seas...We Tidesages have a long standing conflict with the druids that roam the land. Their plants seep in and absorb our waters...neither side can stand each other...but perhaps...no...impossible..."
