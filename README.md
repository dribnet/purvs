### Bubble Clock

I've managed to give life to my idea and its starting to become what i had invisioned it to be. Theres still much more to be done like properly syncing the text and the circles as well as adding more animations and an alarm feature.

I changed the colours of the shadows as i felt that having coloured shadows didnt really make sense.

I also added rough animations for when the alarm is going off however they still need to be refined.
