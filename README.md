## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

In this part, I was focusing on adding different colors into my drawing. 

My original idea was trying to achieve the MBE style. But I found that it is hard to control the drawing shapes to match the elements sizes. So I reduced a little bit my expectation to do the colors painting.

Additionally, I paid attention on the textures of elements. For example, I tended to show the smooth Pokemon ball and tail ball, I added some tectures (white lines) on them. For color selection, I used the colors from my sketch, including red, blue, white and black.

On the other hand, I added a new level into this part, sleepy marill. It stays in the middle between tail part and woke up marill. So the whole story will be you go into the ball, find a sleepy marill, and woke it up.

Zoom 0: Poke balls
Zoom 1: half Poke balls
Zoom 2: half Poke balls & tail part
Zoom 3: half Poke balls & sleepy marill
Zoom 4: half Poke balls & woke up marill
