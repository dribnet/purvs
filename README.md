For now I have added Calcifer as just an orange flame. I changed the shape so that it is more random giving more life to my character. There are variables including pupil size, base orangeness (all flames have a random orangeness and each layer of the flame is just slightly different from its base), fire's opacity, mouth height and mouth width. 

I am thinking of including having the eyes look in different directions.
