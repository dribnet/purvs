## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2
I am working very closely with the code given out. This is my experiments in using an arc instead of a second cicle. 

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `start` :The start angle of my arc
  * `stop` :The end angle of my arc
