## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

I have decided to bring in the second green squar a lot closer to the central pink square. As the alphabet progresses, the green square will "rotate" around the pink square and spiral outwards. I am doing this because I am aiming for a more abstract alphabet with little resemblance to English characters. I will continue testing with spacing and see what looks best.
