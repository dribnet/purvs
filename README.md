## PS2 MDDN 242 2018

Ive started to implement my alphabet into the template provided by the lecturer.

The main premise of my alphabet is that there is a stationary line at a 45 degree angle and there are 2 right angles that move around the static line, creating the different letters.

The first set of parameters are for the first right angle
The second set of parameters are for the second right angle.
The parameters are:
Trans1X
Trans1Y
rot1

Trans2X
Trans2Y
rot2
