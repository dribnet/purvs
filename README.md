## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images I have uploaded are of, a building in Sydney, my bass, and one of my plants. These were all images that remind me of something important.
Currently the masks used are the one's provided at the beginning of the project, however I have plans to use different types of noise, to create effects specific to image.
The code is also the same as provided though my initial inspiration is driving me to look into light strings that are drawn along edges that occur within the images.

input_1:
So far I really like how this one looks with its current effects. I think the image content and its colors look really interesting in a mosaic style, and it will be interesting to see what other effects I can come up with.

input_2:
I really like the coloring in this result. The asymmetry bothers me a little, and I'm not what noise types to use, but I'm sure I will have a fun time figuring it out.

input_3:
This is my least favorite of the three so far, but I think that is greatly because I am using the wrong mask and effect for it. I'm sure that as I continue to work on it, I can turn it into something a lot nicer.
