## 2020 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections


My idea is to create three variations of frogs. Some continuous variables will be the body shape, eye openness, eye position, and head shape. Some discrete variables will be if they're winking, eye pupil shape and mouth shape. Two variations will be full body and one will be a side-profile of the head.

Redefined Distribution

The body size of both frogs and under colouring use refined distributions.
Both frogs have a higher chance to be on the smaller side. The blog frog will mostly be smaller/mediumly wide and mostly short. The side frog has lower focus but will still tend to be on the smaller size.
