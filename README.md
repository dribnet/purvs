## Alarm

For my alarm I wanted to make sure that it wasn't too obnoxious and/or distracting from the simple and calm feeling that my original clock felt to me. When the alarm is counting down the larger circles become red and fade until the inner circle from that one lights up red. This repeats untill the alarm goes off. When the alarm is going off, circles appear to shrink and grow untill the alarm is finished.
