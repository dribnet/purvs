Part3: Interpolation


On this page, I have a problem with the transition between characters. It because I draw the patterns with gridding
structure. The process of changing a character shows only what the previous letter and the forward letter have in common. I tried to, but there was always something wrong. Anyway, I think it is fine with the transition because you can still see the change between the letters.


The three parameters per letter:
  * A pattern in the form of a grid(14*14)
  * The first letter of each pattern's name represents that letter
  * The rest of the pattern is hidden except for the main part
