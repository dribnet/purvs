## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

EXAMPLE 3: In this version, I added 2 circle parameters that are used in the letters C, O, Q, R, U, and 8. As these were my last parameters I only had space for their x position and y position and wasn't able to change their size. Though the addition of these circles is an interesting new element to the design I believe the circles look too different from the other two foreground objects (sharp tiangles and lines). Therefore I will not be using these circles in my final design. 
The other thing I changed in this version was the colour of the background shapes to different shades of blue depending on the shape. I like this change as it helps differentiate the letters, however it doesn't look great when the letters are switching as they suddenly change colour. To fix this I will look at changing the last two parameters I had used to create the foreground circles to now change the background shape colour. 


The parameters per letter:
  * `backgroundShapeType` : the type of the background shape (triangle, circle, sqaure)
  * `backgroundShapeRotate` : the rotation of the background shape
  * `trianglePosX` : x position of the foreground traingle
  * `trianglePosY` : y postion of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleRotate` : roation of the foreground triangle
  * `triangleSize` : size of the foreground triangle
  * `lines1VerticalXpos` : the x postion of the vertical lines
  * `lines2HorizontalYpos` : the y position of the first horizonatal lines
  * `lines3HorizontalYpos` : the y position of the second horizonatal lines
  * `linesHorizonalRotate` : the rotation of the horizonatal lines
