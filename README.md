## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is just an incrimental upload with the demonstration of grid code in class so I have a copy of it. For my image themes I have been thinking about exploring a disconnection or dissociation between people and their identities and connecting it to technology. I would want my photographs to be clean and desaturated but not grayscale. They would depict a person standing infront of a mirror and their reflection, two people standing facing each other looking down at phones in their hands or looking at each other. I would use the masks to make the areas around the heads/ faces or reflections blurry and organic, as if they are out of focus while the rest of the body and environment would be sharper and more inorganic to show case a disconnection and loss of focus.
