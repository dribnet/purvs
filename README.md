## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Further Experiments on Background Line Details

I have experimented making my horizontal lines look wavy but I'm wondering if it made the whole image look busy, especially for the ivy image. I think I prefer the straight horizontal lines with small gaps between them. For some reason my grid reminds me of a Japanese style comic. I really like how the grid added to more appeal to my images.
