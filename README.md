## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2


Added some extra wow to my wheel interpolation. Now the colour pulses as the wheel rotates. I really like this and i think it looks super cool! I just have to refine it a little bit more. i also changed the colour to purple to try it out. Not too sure about it.

This week in class i will have to clean everything up and just  make sure it is all neat. I might play around with the colours as well.
