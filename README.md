### Is it Time?

With my clock I want to take the wide appeal of the popular binary state clock[isitwednesday.org](http://isitwednesday.org/) and expand its concept to a universally relevant application.
**IsItTime** is a handy tool, useful when you need to check whether the constant of time has collapsed on itself.
The clock will use large, bold, red text for readability and clarity. It will display "YES" if linear time continues to function. If this is not the case, the physics that govern the universe around us will disintegrate.
