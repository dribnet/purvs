I have now finished the alphabet and have planned/ started on the numbers. 

4 characters in my alphabet require 2 quads but since I am already at 16 parameters I couldn't do this. I tried to work around this by remaking the letters that require 2 quads so that they only needed 1. The letters/ numbers that need 2 quads are:
X
Z
3
5

I have redone the X and Z to only use one quad and I think they mostly read correctly. I also redid the W because I thought it didn't really come across as a W.

The 16 parameters per letter:
  * `Yshift1` : top of line position for first line
  * `Yshift2` : top of line position for second line
  * `Yshift3` : top of line position for third line
  * `Yshift4` : top of line position for fourth line   

  * `length1` : length bottom of line position for first line
  * `length2` : length bottom of line position for second line
  * `length3` : length bottom of line position for third line
  * `length4` : length bottom of line position for fourth line


  * `Xquad1` : x position of first quad point
  * `Xquad2` : x position of second quad point
  * `Xquad3` : x position of third quad point
  * `Xquad4` : x position of fourth quad point

  * `Yquad1` : y position of first quad point
  * `Yquad2` : y position of second quad point
  * `Yquad3` : y position of third quad point
  * `Yquad4` : y position of fourth quad point
