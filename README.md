### Current Cloud Hop Clock

So at this stage I have made the basic clock. The backgrounds and Icons change depending on the time, as well as Dino appearing on each cloud of the current hour. 

The remaining bits to do for basic hand in are:
	- Alarm Functionality
	- Animations (currently None, Dino just hops pops in on each cloud, and clouds in the background need to be added)
	- Finish/Finalize art
	
After these are added I can start to add in extra features.
