## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

Final ReadMe:

i had afew ideas leading into this assignment of what i wanted to do. initially a completley abstarct alphabet was what i was leaning towards, one that played around with rectangles, ellipses and triangles to build each letter, but after alot of thinking and looking at the "A,B,C" sketch i began to hate and wanted to move on and re-think of a newer and better idea, one thing that stayed true to that sketch was the light blue that i used for drawing some parts of the letters. i started playing around with styles and was sort of settling for an idea which was initially having a rounded edges on a rect() and then cutting out areas of that rectangle to make the letters, but i soon realised that afew people had a similar idea to that, therefore, i decided to re-think that idea. after some deliberation i finally decided on my final idea, the idea that i ended on, to me looked exactly to how i wanted it, it was abstract but still legible. this idea did come with some issues. the first was initially i made each letter into its very own function, and then called each letter function that i made in the drawLetter function. this worked in the beginning but when it came to the interpolation it did not work as the letters wouldnt interpolate between eachother they would just jump from letter to letter and i was wanting a linear interpolation between each letters. so i had to re do my letters, luckily when i designed my letters i sketched them all out and new exactly how many parameters i needed for them so it was a terribly difficult task to re do my draw letters function that would work with the interpolation. After that was done it was time to make the letters look alittle bit nicer. first i changed the whole colour scheme and kept it with a nice blues that work well with each and then i added fake 3D which really made everything look a whole lot better. Overall i really like how my alphabet looks and with the 3D aspect to it, it makes it look a whole lot cleaner, plus the whole design of my alphabet is really nice and looks exactly how i wanted it.


23rd March:
today I played around with creating ideas for the letters A,B and C for my alphabet. I am leaning towards a abstract concept but my mind is still open to other ideas, more research and inspiration research is something that i'll do before next class.

25th March:
ive had a fresh look at my idea and ive began to realise i really hate it, the only thing i like about it is the colour but depending on the style of font that i will go for the colour may change.

29th  March:
finally decided on a fot style that i like, its simple, but i like it and i think its just abstract enough to be legible but also nice to look at

29th March:
i have issues with commiting my work on to github it doesnt seem to be working properly

30th March:
we managed to fix the problems with the drawing of the alphabet and now i can carry on with the alphabet

30th March:
finished the basic alphabet

1st April:
i have come to the realisation that i have to re do my font as the interpolation does not work so i have to change everything up :(

i managed to fix and re jig my alphabet but the interpolation is not acting right 

interpolation is working well now, now it is time to make the alphabet more exciting and intriguing to look at

some level of fake 3d was added

added words that i thought showed my alphabet in a cool way
