## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

As the starting point for this project, I've decided to play around with rounded shapes. The initial idea was inspired by typography from the early 2000s. I used basic shapes to create the letterforms in this iteration but I would like to translate it into custom shapes so I can play around with fill and contour while still keeping that elegant and sophisticated feel. The letter 'C' is a challenge, it doesn't look quite right but hopefully when I use custom shapes, I'll be able to communicate it better.
