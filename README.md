### Color Glyphs

Hue: For Hue I made the stroke get darker which makes the shape stand out a lot more. 

Saturation: For saturation as the purple gets brighter, three of the circles expand. 

Lightness: As the purple gets lighter, the circles also get lighter which is quite interesting to observe.
