### Final Cloud Hop Clock

This is the final Version of the Clock. This clock follows a primarily analog look, with a Pixel art style. The clock is set in the sky amongst the clouds where the Main Character, Dino, moves from cloud to cloud on the turn of the hour, while performing small animations over time. When the alarm goes off Dino will start playing an instrument on top of the cloud he is currently on to alert the user.

Its Main Features include:
	- Changing Backgrounds and Icons showing a night and day cycle
	- Animated Main character
	- Animated background clouds

I choose to make this design because I thought that it could look quite dynamic and interesting, as well as my interest in pixel art styled applications.
	
Things I would have liked to have added include:
	- More artwork and animations
	- Connection to a weather API to also show the current weather
	- Cleaner fades and transitions between backgrounds and animations
	
Overall I am happy with how the clock looks in the end, given the time to create it.
