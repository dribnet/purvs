## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

###Background Layer Fixed:

So while putting comments in my code to upload my final I noticed that the background was slightly wrongly coded. The issue was that the colour picked for each row was actually picking it for the current row to be rendered and the one after as well. So I editted the code to fix this which wasn't too hard. However I also cleaned up the code a little bit to rely on the variables more again and just look neater. I also completed the commenting on the background and I will finish the commenting for the final in my next iteration as I am still to get to that.
