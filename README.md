## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

After first post, I found that the pointSize represents the pixel of an image. Therefore, I changed the codes by referencing Tom White's new updated codes. I have not mask the image yet. I only replace the mask files by white background. I think that recttangles could be the great examples of symbolizing pixel. 
And I will change the mask files in next step.
