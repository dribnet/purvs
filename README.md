Exhibition - 16/05/2020

This is the exhibition for my lettering. The title of my font is called 'Vampires' because it suits my blood and fang theme. I also chose this to be my font name because the letters
V A M P I R E S look great together forming that word. I also did a google search for words that are associated with vampies or anything dark but supernatural.  

Here are the other exhibition words:
•  "VAMPIRES"
•  "IMMORTAL"
•  "BLOODCUP"
•  "INFECTED"
•  " CREEPY "
•  " REAPER "
•  "SCARY123"
•  "SINISTER"

I thought these words worked really well with my lettering style. I had 123 at the end of the word scary because I wanted to show off a few of my numbers from this font. In my letters.js
file I added a " " space with no parameters so that I could display text with spaces such as 'creepy' and 'reaper'. I may add more words later but for now I think I have represented my
font well.
