## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Image 1: Texted out how making the shapes thinner would change the overall aesthetic of the image. From the image that came out it seems to have a lot of white patches which I do not like all too much. I feel like it is quite off putting and just does not look right.

Image 2: Changed the size of ellipses back to what they were originally since I was not fond of the white patches that showed up in the back. I also made the rect just a bit thicker width wise (/4) and cut down the length of it by /2 to make short thick lines to see how that would work on the background. It looks alright for the most part but I think it just looks boring. Nothing is really happening so I feel like I need to do just slightly more drastic changes.

Image 3: Just changed the background cause I wanted to try out how it will look like. Increased the height by 6 and divided the width by 4 to make it. Looks quite interesting but I don't know if I want to add it to the final.

These tests are just to help me find some idea for what type of theme I want. I feel like I want to make a glitchy type of pixel art so Im going to play with the masking and redo the tiles.
