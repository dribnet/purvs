## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

So, this is my final version. The sort of theme I was going for was the importance of play, an idea and quote which gets thrown around a bit at gaming conferences, and how this relates to me. I tried to achieve this by taking photos of objects that I find important to me and use as my main source of entertainment to help relax and take a break from life. I also wanted to try and add influences from major gaming icons like Nintendo in a few subtle ways to make the whole thing seem a bit more playful.

For the masks I mainly used gimp because I had a lot of trouble using smartmask. I did attempt to use it for the all the images. When trying smartmask, I used the main standalone application and used the quick selection tool in manual mode as auto was having same problems trying to select the right areas because my photos were quite dark. I tried using a size of 50 and tolerance of 25, then using refine to try and tidy up the edges, but I couldn't get very good results because my photos were to dark, so things like the speakers and monitor just blended in to the background and it would select everything.

I choose to stick with a grid pattern and used the thin honeycomb shaped object to build the image that was masked was because it kind of gave a screen like effect, like you could see pixels, more specifically, what pixels can look like when zoomed in. I chose to make it honeycomb instead to just rectangles/squares, as I thought that it would make the design I bit more interesting.

The reason for making the background black and adding stars was because I was trying to go with the idea of just blocking out the background and focusing on what is in front of me, which is something I try and do when I want to relax and take time out from work.
