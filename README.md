## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Test
Reflection:

When I started this project, I took a great deal of inspiration from Ryan Alexander's Mycelium. As I ran into many errors along the way, I began leaning more towards scribble art. I do not regret this decision, however given more time I would have like to experiment more with Mycelium's concept, to see what I could come up with myself.

I found this assignment very difficult in terms of programming. I kept running into issues where the code wasn't acting in the way that I thought it should, and this caused me to focus more on the technical side of it, rather than my theme. Because of this, I think my theme is one that would have to be explained, and that it does not stand on its own. This upsets me because I feel like I wanted to connect to an audience with these pieces, but I think without the theme, they will simply be objects drawn messily.

I am proud however, that I managed to get the scribble effect working. I experimented with randomized variables plugged into the stroke weight, and the length. I also tried using Bezier and quadratic curves to create a more natural effect. However I decided that those factors were best left out as the density of the images became overbearing and they started to lose finer details.

For coloring, I chose to go with a grayscale result. This seemed to work best for the style I was going for. When I tried to use full color, it looked strange against the grey background, and when I added in the original image as a background, it not only reduced the pop of the focused object, it also made it look like an error.

If I was to do this again, I would try and spend more time focused on a theme that could be more relatable to others, and I would flesh that out first. Only after that, would I begin to dive into the coding side of things, as I feel like having a vision to begin with is important.

Style:

I wanted my outputs to have been influenced by scribble art (taking a photo and recreating it with scribbles).

Theme:

I wanted to have a theme that reflects the passions in my life. I chose three images showing travel, music, and technology.

-------------------------------------------

I am trying to recreate specific pieces of the image, through messily drawn lines. I feel that the way to make this pop the most, is to have a black background, however I am currently experimenting with different options.

I currently feel that the theme I am trying to convey is not obvious enough through my photos, so I may need to change those before hand in.

-------------------------------------------

The images I have uploaded are of, a building in Sydney, my bass, and one of my plants. These were all images that remind me of something important.
Currently the masks used are the one's provided at the beginning of the project, however I have plans to use different types of noise, to create effects specific to image.
The code is also the same as provided though my initial inspiration is driving me to look into light strings that are drawn along edges that occur within the images.

input_1:
So far I really like how this one looks with its current effects. I think the image content and its colors look really interesting in a mosaic style, and it will be interesting to see what other effects I can come up with.

input_2:
I really like the coloring in this result. The asymmetry bothers me a little, and I'm not what noise types to use, but I'm sure I will have a fun time figuring it out.

input_3:
This is my least favorite of the three so far, but I think that is greatly because I am using the wrong mask and effect for it. I'm sure that as I continue to work on it, I can turn it into something a lot nicer.
