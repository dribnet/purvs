## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

If you click in to my render html you can see what I have been
trying to describe. This is a quick render into a bias perspective
of someone towards asian woman, thinking she must be a Christian etc.
A png file I drew with many other religion symbols will be placed
right on top of the "bias rendered image" right after with a quote
"I can be anything" written on her hair. Although this little animation
from a bias perspective image to her being able to be anything/anyone
will not be shown in the exhibition sign but I still want to do it as
I think it adds a lot more to my project. I also think that this express
my topic well. With this animation, my idea is pretty much fully explained
in just one image but using also my image2 and image3 will make a series
which make more sense since all my 3 models have different skin colour 
in my three image. 

Next step:

- I want to develope my background glyph more. Now they are just ellipses
which does not fully fit my illustration png. I might try using some
comic style shapes/ lines.

-Redraw cross glyph with vertex.
