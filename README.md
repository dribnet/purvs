### Sine Wave Clock
My design is to have a static sine wave drawn on the canvas with different balls along it, each ball being a unit of time. The distance the balls are along the sine wave relates to the time they represent.

I have got my sine wave clock working as a functioning clock now. Each ball represents a unit of time from smallest to largest - millis to hours and they travel along the sine wave near perfectly, I also had to smooth all of their movement so it wasnt jagged. I have also implemented a basic background shade change to denote night/day (sunrise/set at 7am/pm).
I now need to work out an alarm function and continue to make my design more visually appealing.
