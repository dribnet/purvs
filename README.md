Final

The wallpaper is inspired by Sci-fi elements and uses both shapes and colours associated with this. My initial goal was to created a full hexagonal grid however struggled to get it working. This lead me to create a more line based pattern.

The lanscape is inspired by greebles. These are displacements for creating scifi plates on cities or ships. I used layers of rectangles layered on each other with gradully lighter colours. This gives the effect of depth as these represnt buildings. I am happy with how this has turned out as, although it doens't quite have the same effect as a greeble, I think when this is used as a displacement map it will effectively generate a city structure. To do this I will need to change it to greyscale first.
