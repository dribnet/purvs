## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
I've done more experimenting by changing my mask on my slinky adding the crosshatching on the stroke. I like th results, especially on the rubiks cube as well. It has inverted so that the paint blobs are on the background and the hatching is within the mask. I did this by editing my if statement, I want to move onto playing around with my mask on the first image of the rubiks cube by applying the hatching effect onto the baloons on either side of the canvas. This could be a cool effect and create a better composition on the page. The large blobs almost remind me of the aperture setting on a camera, in the way that you can adjust the focus of the image. For example, making the subject within focus and the background (blurred) or out of focussed. This is a good tool especially for this assignment as I am really trying to keep my subjects in focus so that the background is not too distracting. I really want my viewer to see my work as an abstract expression. The best way of achieving this is through my use of colour and really manipulating the shape of the pixel. At this stage the crosshatching shows this expression best and I really want to develop this. The rubiks cube is starting to look very abstracted but it also identifiable. I dont want to make it any more abstract then it is.
