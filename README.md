## MDDN 242 2022 Assignment 2

It has been a little while since I updated my code. I have had an extremely busy week with hand ins for my primary papers and general life stuff but I am ready to get back into this project now. I have updated my preview and thumbnail to show a show I sketch I made last week. In previous readmes I have talked about the pixel example from 'Type me, Type me not' and I still consider that to be my main precedent currently. I have always quite enjoyed pixel fonts like [The Windows Command Prompt Font](https://www.dafont.com/windows-command-prompt.font?text=Henry+Bethwaite+-+INDN+211%2C+Project+%231) or [The ZX Spectrum Font](https://www.dafont.com/zx-spectrum.font?text=Henry+Bethwaite+-+INDN+211%2C+Project+%231) so I want to do something along those lines.

I am currently quite a bit behind where I should be for this project so the next steps I will have to take is creating an MVP (minimal viable product) to see how much I like the idea of the cascading/ growing pixel fonts.
