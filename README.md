## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

PROTOCOS STRIPPED-BACK
The stripped back version of my letter set is the version of my font which I achieved just after successfully 'debugging' the coordinates of my parameters. I have included this in my block commits to showcase an earlier, clean version of my font without any additives or flare.
For the sake of this commit I have changed the interpolation maps to the vanilla version which was provided when this project was first handed out.
I hope you enjoy. Christopher.
