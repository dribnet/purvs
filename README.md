I have many ideas of what I would like to make, a few of them are:

-	Numbers will change when they get filled up(they will get filled in different rates)
-	Something similar to an Astronomical clock(Prague’s Astronomical clock as a templet)
-	Shadow clock
-	Gears
-	a constant flow of something to represent time
-	gravity manipulation of object
-	electronic circuit

I will be looking at most of these as possible final ideas, but for the sketch I will use the “filling up” idea.
