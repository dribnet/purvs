## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Tue 29th May
I have worked out how to create two masks and implement them into my artwork piece. I have also taken polygon code from 
https://p5js.org/es/examples/form-regular-polygon.html to create an almost 3D affect of the bushes in the first picture.
I am now going to keep experimenting with the code I have created and try to produce something creative from my next few pictures.
I am also going to create secondary masks for my other pictures.

For my theme I am leaning on the idea of the cultural enviroment taking over the natural enviroment. Merely touching on the idea of pollution and how we are destroying our earth.

I have imported my own images and used the sample code given in class and changed it. So far I have done all 3 of my images with masks and replaced the old cartoon ones I was experimenting with earlier. I am now going to experiment with the code to create abstract images of my 3 imported images to get more ideas.
