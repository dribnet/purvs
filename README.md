## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Process 4:

For my first picture, I think that the background is too empty and blank. The original background of this picture has stairs behind the piano, but the triangles made the details of the background dissapeared. Therefore, I have the idea of showing the details of the background by drawing it. After I experiment this, I found that the hand drawing part doesn't seem really nice with the pixels. When three pictures are stick together, the drawing doesn't match with the other two pictures. So I decided not to add the hand drawing background to my final pictures.
