For the fox face, I change the movement of ears, the blink of eyes and the length of nose.

For the Chinese mask, I parameterize its eyebrow value to change shape and color, eye value to change the shape of eyes, mouth value to open mouth, skin value to change skin color, and triangle value to generate triangles.

For the right third face, I did a tiger face, then I parameterize the line value in sunglasses, which can become eyebrow or reflection of sunglasses, secondly, I parameterize the beard value and face value to expend or shorten them, thirdly, I parameterize the mouth value to open or close mouth.
