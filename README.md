## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have decided that, instead of trying to have the text be drawn through code, I am just going to use a png (based of the ep cover text) over top, as this shows the text clearer. This is for a couple of reasons. Trying to draw it with code wasn't working. Cathal said that he didn't like how the text was looking when I drew it in code. And the most important part of this project is the final outputs- nothing matters if the billboard image doesn't look good. So I am going with what looks best, and what conveys the branding of Gajuar the best- it's pointless having unreadable text for an ad. I've also made the text smaller, as this puts the focus onto the image. Cathal said that he liked the rounded, playful look of the writing.
I have used an if statement and a mask with a tiny dot on the left side to call the text png for image 2 and 3, if there is a bit of the mask on the left side (the tiny dot) then the png is displayed.
I have also shortened the longer lines, from 40 to 30. This is because in image 2, the vertical stripes that really make the image striking were being lost. The slightly shorter lines allow these vertical stripes be a lot more apparent, while still creating the blending effect of the coloured images.
