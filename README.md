Through a bit of trial and error im working out how to do my own letters by changing around the code provided. 
I have changed my idea a little bit to just iusing two triangles at most as this will allow me to change a max of 12 parameters through changing the six points of the two triangles. 
So far the most parameters i have had to change is 10 (by keeping the starting point the same this saves me 2 parameters.)
=======

In the process of completing the entire alphabet, I have [made what changes?].
This included updating the parameters to [add/remove parameters for?].

The three parameters per letter are now:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
