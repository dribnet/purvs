Experimenting with shapes and color.

Changed the ellipse input from (...., circleSize, circleSize), to (...., circleSize, circleSize* 3).
The color didn't make sense, and could look like I'm trying to potray a techno theme.
The ellipses drawn as ovals were okay for the most part, but around the bottom of the object the image didn't come out too great. I preferred the way circles drew the image over the ovals.
