## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

IN CLASS ASSIGNMENT

- i am experimenting further with the ellipses and rectangles to see how i can form the mask shape with colour and depict the importance of the image.

- I need to work out the mask differences as there is extra space outside the mask at the moment.

- I like the squares and ellipse contrast at the moment so will keep developing from this concept.
