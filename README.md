So far I have followed all the steps in the Getting Started
instructions. I had to clone via SSH not HTTPS though, as my
Github account requires two-factor authentication due to my
workplace. After a slight hiccup where I initially cloned via
HTTPS, I followed the rest of the steps and have now updated
the README, and optimized the preview and thumbnail images
using two tools called ImageAlpha and ImageOptim.
