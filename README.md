## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I am currently taking Typography, where I've been researching how geometric shapes make up letter forms and I felt inspired to create my letter forms from geometric shapes in p5.js, I want them be abstract like but somewhat still resemble the letter.

As a pop art enthusiast my overall design approach is inspired by pop art.

Currently I have 13 parameters:

*Shape1 the arc*
1. size: The size of the arc
2. offsetx: x offset of the arc
3. offsety: y offset of the arc
4. arcStart: starting angle for the arc
5. arcEnd: ending angle for the arc

*Shape2 the second circle*
6. size1: The size of the ciccke
7. offsetx2: x offset of the circle
8. offsety2: y offset of the cicrle

*Shape3 the rectangle*
9. width: width of the rectangle
10. height: height of the rectangle
11. offsetx3: x offset of the rectangle
12. offsety3: y offset of the rectangle
13. angle: angle of rotation of the rectangle

**Previous work**

In regards to experimentation 1 and 2 that I previously did; I really like the pop art look, its fun and kind of makes me think of tutti fruity flavours. However I really like the black and white one too and how it creates a strong contrast. I feel like that one would be for more formal practices. As I refine my work further + get feedback I will make a choice on which one I prefer.
