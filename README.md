## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Changed my first output to the new grid format for the model in the seperate for loop. Working on fixing up my 3rd mask to match the other first two images and themes. My images take quite a long time to load due to my multiple for loops but I kinda do not want to adjust this as I like the way it looks currently.
