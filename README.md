Playing with colour and lines

Each letter and number is composed of one circle and 4 lines. Developing from my last stage I made the thickness of the circles thinner so the letters without curves are able to be read through the circle. I added a gradient of lines behind each shape to add colour and layers to my design. I feel the lines behind make the letters slightly individual from each other so I want to try play with the bakground more to connect them. I also did my numbers as a clocks style and made the default an arrow.


The parameters per letter:
  
  * 'size': size of main ellipse backdrop
  * 'lh1': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lw1': y co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lh2': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lw2': y co-ordinate of line2
  * 'c1x': x position of main ellipse
  * 'c1y': y position of main ellipse
  * 'lx': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'ly': y co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lx2': x co-ordinate of line1
  * 'lx3': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'ly3': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'lx3_1': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'ly3_1': x co-ordinate of line3
  * 'lx4': x co-ordinate of line4
  * 'ly4': x co-ordinate of line4
  * 'lx4_1': x co-ordinate of line4
  * 'ly4_1': x co-ordinate of line4
