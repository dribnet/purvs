## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I feel really happy with where my design is at right now, and will likely not be making any further changes to this.
I changed the shape of the sky ellipses slightly to make them a little bit longer. I also changed the opacity of the sky by 5 as I felt that 70 was too strong but 60 was too soft and thus 65 was a good mid-point.
