## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This is my final Custom Pixel. Every pixel size has been reduced to give a clearer image, helping viewers decipher the image easier when they are up close.
The theme behind it is 'Magic and Fantasy'. Two of the images are of a some actors I had perform in a short film I made for another MDDN course. They have beads and stars and other glittery things on their face as well as face paint, as the short film was about a dream a girl has with these colorful characters. These 'Dream Faeries' (the names of the characters in the film) work perfectly with the theme of 'Magic and Fanatsy' as they look like they are from a fiction book or fantasy film. The third image, in the middle, is of a crystal in my hand. When I think of crystals I think of beauty and mystery as well as magic, so I thought it would fit the theme perfectly.
The pixels I made are a bunch of ellipses with differing strokeWeights. There is a large ellipse with a relatively thick strokeWeight, as well as four ellipses inside the larger one, which all have smaller strokeWeights.  Even smaller ellipses sit outside of the largest ellipse in positions similar to that of them sitting in the four corners of an invisible square.
The pixels were isnpired by Art Nouveau posters, as I tried to fit in as much detail as I could without overwhelming the final image in too much detailing.

I like to think of the final output/the custom pixels as a sort of tapestry due to the small details the custom pixels hold.

The custom pixels focus on points of interest in the image - such as the crystal itself, or the faces of th actors. They are also set in circles to give off an impression of a glyph-like style as well as a continuation of the Art Nouveau style, with an empahsis on circular patterning.

I like how the spacing of the pixels creates a white border between the squares and glyphs on the left side, which I think draws attention to the areas of interest. It helps give the image a sort of flow and helps guide the eye.

This was an interesting assignment and I enjoyed viewing the various effects that the different pixel styles had on different images - it was a fun activity just to play around with the code and see how each change had an impact on the image output.
