### One path clock 

This a simple clock that inspired by Mike Bostockâ€™s Polar Clock. There is only one path in this clock by using colours and thickess to show the movements of hour, minute, and second. I added a samll pie clock at the center just to show the length of time have passed and clock digits (hour/minute/day) to backup what the content is . 




Describe the idea for your clock here - replacing this text.
Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your 
image above. You can also include
[web links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now)
to other pages that support your ideas.  The explanation should
be short but compete, no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Replace the "Outrageous clock" title above with the name of
your clock. Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
