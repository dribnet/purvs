My paramaters are over the cap by 8 still being at 20
x - x10
y - y10
all control the points of lines that are drawn.  im not sure how to decrease the ammount without destroying the transitions between letters.
i have changed the background colours for alphabet, interaction and exhibition.js so the colours i have chosen work better and is no longer matte black instead it is now "#222323" to be dark grey and not be overpowering.
