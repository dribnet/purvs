## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel Final

My original idea is to create a serie of three person
with different skin colours in two perspectives. One 
is in judgemental people's and one is in their own perspective.
The first perspective is shown before my image is completely done
rendering(with just one specific religious symbol forming their
face and hair), the second perspective is shown when the image
is actually finished(with the png and all other religious glyphs
placed on top). The main idea I want to express is you can be
whatever you want(to have whatever religion no matter the skin colour 
or ethnic background. I did this project with three religion symbols
which are a cross symbolising Christianity, star symbolising 
Judaism and a oeace sigh to symbol no religion.

I have decided to not use smartmask because the smartmask mask
out the entire person. But I only want to mask out specific parts
of the person. Also, the mask that this program creates is not 
smooth enough and it can not mask objects out perfectly.

I drew three png file of my models in photoshop as a part of my project.
I have chosen png image files to place on top because of the property
of them. Their opacity adds some interesting elements to my overall
design. In my three png images, I have set their opacity to 80% so
when they are placed on my rendered image, my glyphs underneath can
still be seen.

For the background, I have used my heart glyph from PS3. I originally
wanted to do a transition of the empty heart into a full heart, linking
the empty heart to first perspective and full heart to second perspective.
But after a few experiments I realised that this idea can not be achieved
because once the image is rendered, you can not change the fill of an 
object function. I think it would have added a lot more meanings to my
project if it works.

I have created two masks for each model so I can have different glyphs
for background, their outfits, their faces and hair. I tried using other
glyph for the outfit mask and using different colours for the religious 
glyphs on top of my png image but it ends up way too messy so I have 
decided to keep it simple by using just rectangles and black & white.

If I have more time to refine this project, I would ask my models to
wear some brighter colours for experiment shoot. The colours might
create an interesting contrast to the background. I would also draw more
religious glyphs to place on top of my png file so there will be more varieties
of look.

I followed Tom's example codes and push around 10 commits to github but then
they all disappeared after I force a git push. I learn my lesson and will
never force a push again.
