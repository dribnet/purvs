Part 1 - Initial idea

My first idea is designing the alphabets using morse code letters. It might be the same pattern but making it curving or probably the arrangment of the morse code. For this practise, I have arranged the circles for each of my letters. The bigger size of circles showed the starting point of the alphabet and the circles in dark red colour showed the intersection point of the alphabet. The location of the circles are controlled by the three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `shift1` : x axis of the circle
  * `shift2` : y axis of the circle
