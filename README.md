I have decided to continue using my wallpaper pattern from the previous problem set as I feel like I can create different zoom levels easily.

For the first image, this is just a detailed view of my wallpaper pattern. As you can see there are two different types of ellipses. The red one is just plain with a white stroke. The black one has a smaller ellipse inside it.

The second image the first image but zoomed out a bit revealing the overall swirl like pattern. 

The third image is zoomed out even more showing that there a multiple squares.

The fourth image reveals that the squares make up a grid.
