## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Completed my alphabet. Some of the letters do not have complete consistency in terms have some amount of negative space or same distance from the constant triangle but that is because my font is based on how i perceive these letters to be and are based on my visual representation of the sound of that letter in a graphic, sharp and angular style that has a soft appearance due to the tones of colour I have used because sounds of letters can be soft and also sharp depending. 

I experimented with the interpolation. I did try speeding up every parameter since it is quite a sharp looking angular font but I did not like its movement it just did not like quite right. I always had my red triangle moving faster to blend in with the movement of the pink triangles since when there are two pink triangles it is really smooth and I am really happy with that but without the red triangle being sped up it did not quite look right. I ended up changing the sped of the red triangle from /2, 50 to /4, 25 because it looked better and moved with the pink triangles a little bit more clean. I am glad I decided to use the red triangles because the letters individually look much better than they would have if I had only used one triangle and two for other letters and is overall a much more cohesive design, although I had to try and hide the difference with interpolation I am still happy with the outcome. I like that it moves slightly smooth and then has some element of sharpness because that basically represents what my font is. 


Here are my parameters for each letter so far - each letter may have different set of paramaters but every letter or digit only has 12 parameters.
   "triX1": first x point of first triangle
   "triY1": first y point of first triangle
   "triX2": second x point of first triangle
   "triY2": second y point of first triangle
   "triX3": third x point of first triangle
   "triY3": third y point of first triangle


   "2triX1": first x point of second triangle
   "2triY1": first y point of second triangle
   "2triX2": second x point of second triangle
   "2triY2": second y point of second triangle
   "2triX3": third x point of second triangle
   "2triY3": third y point of second triangle

   "3triX1": first x point of third triangle
   "3triY1": first y point of third triangle
   "3triX2": second x point of third triangle
   "3triY2": second y point of third triangle
   "3triX3": third x point of third triangle
   "3triY3": third y point of third triangle
