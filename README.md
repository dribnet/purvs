## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Phoebe told me how to stop the constant rendering, so now I'm able to get an actual output which is good. I've increased the size of the rectangles on the butlers image in an attempt to be closer to Jason Andersons style, but I don't think its looking good (its lost the detail of the hands, and looks just too jumbled/messy). My main concern at the moment is that I don't know if my designs are strong enough. I like the look of them (especially the first two) but I just don't know if they are strong enough design wise and coding technicality wise.
