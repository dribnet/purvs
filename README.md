### In this assignment I will be looking at different styles of clocks and seeing which ones work best when looking/ glancing at them and I will be seeing which 
ones are more visually pleasing to come up with a final design.

Sketch-1: I started off with some basic and strange concepts of clocks. These clocks were going to display the second hours and minutes in different ways like 
flashing lights or using faster and slower rotations to show the difference between hours, minutes and seconds. I also looked at the different inspiration ideas given by the lecturer,
but I found that most of the ideas i came up with wouldnt work for me so I stuck to one of my origional ideas which was the spiral shape.
Sketch-2: This page was basically just going through the ideas given by the lecturer and a little bit of development on the spiral idea. I looked at more traditional spiral shapes that
the Maori used like the koru pattern trying to decide what would look best and would work with the triple design I am looking a doing. I felt like going down a more traditional method 
would look best with the type of spiral design that Im doing, but I needed to find a type of spiral that could work with having hours, minutes and seconds in the design.
Sketch-3: The third page of sketches was still looking at different types of spirals but in more depth, I feel like I like either the last or second to last for the final because they 
can display the numbers more clearly. The dotted spiral one could work best if coded right, but it may be harder for the user to view/look at due to lack of numbers but they can always
be added in.
