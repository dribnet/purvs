## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

My typeface is called ArcsDeco.
Named so due to the heavy art deco influence and the fact each character is represented by 2 or 3 arcs.


The fourteen parameters per letter:
  >**mainArcSize** size of the main arc
  >**mainArcX** X position of the main arc
  >**mainArcY** Y position of the main arc
  >**mainArcStart** start point of the main arc
  >**mainArcEnd** end point of the main arc
  >**subArcSize1** size of the first sub arc
  >**subArcSize2** size of the second sub arc
  >**subArc1X** X position of the first sub arc
  >**subArc1Y** Y position of the first sub arc
  >**subArc1Start** start point of the first sub arc
  >**subArc1End** end point of the first sub arc
  >**subArc2X** X position of the second sub arc
  >**subArc2Y** Y position of the second sub arc
  >**subArc2Start** start point of the second sub arc
  >**subArc2End** end point of the second sub arc

  As per feedback, I have changed the background colour to a lavender, from pink. I have also tweaked a few parameters to make the animations look a little nicer.
