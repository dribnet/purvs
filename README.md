# PART 4
## Screen Lights (final)
TOUR RECOMMENDED, please be patient with the loading :)
My final version is a representation of a monitor/screen's workings with sets of RGB, where the complexity increases on zooms. I wanted to keep the initial inspiration of my previous versions and problemsets so I added further blend mode abstractions and animation in the deeper zooms. 
I'm fairly happy with how this turned out, I did struggle a decent amount with the provided code and the lag between zooming/animations does ruin the overall quality but I was able to make it much more efficient than in previous versions. I also wanted to keep the pixels within the screen shape, but that proved difficult. I would have liked to get that working if I were to do this again.
