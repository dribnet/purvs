## My curent Ideas
I missed a couple classes so I've been trying to get back on track. Looking through all of the stuff the one that really stood out to me was Ryan Alexanders work. The white or whitish image on a dark background I feel couold be a realy interesting tool to explore. In Ryans case I think the image comes out kinda old looking and that is kinda intersting. I just did a little testing with it.

## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
