## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

20/5 - The reason my interaction wasn't working was a small typo, which Hazel spotted. Now it's all working good, and looks pretty nice. I'm not the biggest fan of how some of the arcs shrink in size, then appear really big before shifting to their new position, but I have had a look at stopping that and I can't see any way to. from arcstart to arcfinish it runs clockwise, so I think its just a bit of a weird way that the animation decides to shift things/is the shortest way for it to animate. Other than that, I've tidied up my code a bit, the alphabets looking good, just need to sort out a small issue with my sketch.


The thirteen parameters per letter:
  arcStart - start position of the first arc
  arcFinish - end position of the first arc
  arc2Start - start position of the second arc
  arc2Finish - end position of the second arc
  arc3Start - start position of the third arc
  arc3Finish - end position of the third arc
  arc3opacity - visibility of the third arc
  Size1 - diameter of the first circle
  Size2 - diameter of the second circle
  xpos1 - X position of the first circle, used to position the arcs
  ypos1 - Y position of the first circle, used to position the arcs
  xpos2 - X position of the second circle, used to position the arcs
  ypos2 - Y position of the second circle, used to position the arcs
