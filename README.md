## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

-Smartmask

Here I tried out the smartmask. I used images of a crowd, elephants in a queue and a basket of fruit. The artworks that are shown are really abstracted versions of these pictures. I particularly wanted to bring attention to what exactly I had masked which is why I made the masked part very square and bold and the things I did not mask as small circles that created a lot of blank space. I might use the mask for my final image as I can see that it easily picks up a person and it would mean that I would have to draw around a person in photoshop to create this mask.
