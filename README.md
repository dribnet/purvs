Gefallen 
  - This is the name I have given my design. I dont know if I will change it. At this point I am very happy with it. But it is in german and I dont know if thats allowed.

I have based my letters around the gothic style of lettering. I will try use an arc, triangle and a line to do this I have found these can portray the type of lettering I want. I have also chosen these in particular because of their link to the deathly hallows from harry potter. I like to try and encorporate other intrests of mine like this as it gets me more interested in my own work. It means I want to do it and have it do well as it has more of a connection to meand I will enjoy working on it more.

I have completed the alphabet and am happy with he majrity of the lettering. I still want to tweak a few things and play around with different colour options to see which works best. I might also might draw this from harry potter but will have to experiment to see if the colouring works.
I have got the transition to work but want to experiment with it to get the arc to transition smoother.

I have twelve paramaters fore ach of my letters;
	"a1" : The first angle of the arc.
  	"a2" : The second Angle of the arc.

  	"tx1" : The first X location of the triangle.
  	"ty1" : The first Y location of the triangle.
  	"tx2" : The second X location of the triangle.
  	"ty2" : The second Y location of the triangle.
  	"tx3" : The third X location of the triangle.
  	"ty3" : The third Y location of the triangle.

  	"lx1" : The first X location of the line.
  	"ly1" : The first Y location of the line.
  	"lx2" : The second X location of the line.
  	"ly2" : The second Y location of the line.
