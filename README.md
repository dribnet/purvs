Porting my experiment sketch code into the framework provided. Established the current parameters to create a line. Have not stated any parameters for the cosmetic/aesthetics. Just trying to get a functional line in the framework. In future I believe I will have to create a second line to get to make the letters more recognizable. E.g. "q" consists of a arc and line.
