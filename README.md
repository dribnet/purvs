This parametric toy creates a grid of 5x3 monsters,
that have randomly generated features such as color, height, facetype, nose,
mouth, and horn size.

Random features such as width and mouth are obtained using a normal distribution.
The eyes are obtained using a special random function, to make having only 1 eye or
6 eyes a rare event.

Click anywhere on the canvas to generate a new set of monsters.

Have fun!
