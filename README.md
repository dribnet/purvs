## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Concept:

Create an alphabet inspired by the Bauhaus typography from the 1920's. This type style foucsed on geometric shapes, vibrant colours, balanced layouts with harmony and sans-serif letters in upper case. In my type I am wanting to create this style through using 3 simple shapes, a semi-circle, a line and a full circle. Each shape has a different colour similar to the Bauhaus type.


The ten parameters per letter:

- circDiam: the size of the circle
- CircleX: the x position of the circle
- CircleY: the y position of the circle 
- lineX: x position of the rectangle 
- lineY: y position of the rectangle 
- lineX2: height of the rectangle 
- lineY2: width of the rectangle 
- flipX: Arc x to swap numerical value with y
- flipY: Arc y to swap numerical value with x 
- StrokeW: Changes the thickness of the line 


Worked on looking at the interaction between the letters. Updated variable names to make them more clear. For the interpolate letters, all my maps were set at 0, 100. This map made the animation run really smooth, however, i changed a few of the maps to be slightly more jarring and make the animation look more visually interesting. Although this means the animation isnt as effortless with the maps as they were, I like the new effect more.

Also picked the name of my alphabet: Germano
I picked this name because the Bauhaus movmement began in Germany. I then changed the end letter to the "o" because I really like this letter in my font. The colours i used also resemble the german flag accidentally.
