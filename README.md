## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I have added the 2 layer mask to the images and am working on making them 3 layers. This commit was to show what the images look like with the original filter on, but I am going to change it as there is going to be an extra layer for nature.

Previous README.md didnt upload so here is a copy of that.
In this commit I made the first layer in the masks using toms smartmask feature. I like the idea behind the smartmask but for windows users it is a hassel to use and I will not be using it aging because it would mean I have to transfer all of my files back over to the mac. If there was code that was added for the windows users I would use it again though. 

With the first layer of masks it was useful to use this technique, but now I will have to photoshop and recode to fit in the masks as my code only cooperates with 2 different colours for the mask and I need it to work with 3 colours. Now I need to photoshop the greenery into the masks.
