## MDDN 242 2021 Assignment 2

I've started playing around with ideas for my alphabet, I am very interested in going down an art deco (retro?) or neo-futrisitc route.

I'm interested in using rounded rectange instead of arcs or ellipses.  

I now want to add more perimeters to improve my ideas, I also want to fix the placement of my letters on the page.
