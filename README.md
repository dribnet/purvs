I am exploring a different grid layout based on both my landscape and pattern designs I created in the previous project. 
I am thinking of an idea where it begins with a lot of squares. Then as you zoom in there are rounder shapes.
Or I could look at beginning with circles to symbolise the clouds then as you zoom in there are squares which would symbolise a cityscape.
