Rewrote all my code completely as I wasnt happy with the issues i was having before, and I thought of a way to write it a lot more concisely and generally just a lot better. The new version fixed all of the issues that I was having, howeever does have a few downsides. 1 is that now all of the squares edges are always visible even if they are next another, this results in a lot of lines in a grid across each letter. While I dont dislike this look, it wasnt in my origin plan for the look, and it takes away from its minimalism. Another issue is that because im using 'on off' switches to cut each shape, the interpolating between is a little odd, but I personally like it, it looks as if each letter is quickly being constructed as each cube flickers in and out. My next plan is to refine this animation, and come up with a name for my alphabet.
