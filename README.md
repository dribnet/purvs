## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2




I started off working on sketch.js to get the used to the way this Assignment works. It took me a while to understand the way this code works, but it started to make more sense after I added some variables. Once I had a better idea of what I was doing I started working on the alphabet. I chose to use triangles as I thought I would be able to manipulate different forms more easily. I also used a lot of ellipses for assingment 1, so I thought this would be a good change. I chose different shades of turquoise for my colours, but I might change the opacity later on once all letters/numbers are finished and I can see it all clearly. While I was adding on letters, a few new ideas came to my mind, but I will edit them once I actually get all the letters done.

 Update 2.
 I finished the alphabet and added some shapes to letters that only had 2 triangles. My next step is to do the numbers. Once that is done I will play around with stroke and opacity.

Update 3.
I really like the way the animation turned out. Especially A to V as they are the same, but opposite directions. I also really like X and W.

Update 4.
I finalised my exhibition page and chose the words freezing, glaciers and diamonds. I thought the colours gave the font a cold theme. The triangles reminded me of ice and crystals which is why I chose glacier and diamond. Those words also use the letters I like the most (such as NDS) and show a good range of letters.

I changed the background colour a few times and settled for a dark blue. I also liked black because of the contrast, but I thought a dark blue would link back to the "cold" theme while still contrasting the colours.

I polished some letters and luckily realised my letter S was backwards. I ended up using the backwards S as the number 2 and flipped the S the right way.
