This is my code for the alphabet. There are 10 parameters in total,
they control postion of the two lines and three ellipse (even the radius of ellipses).
And then the lines and a diamond shape is the key element for every letters. 

The parameters:
size_i is controlling the diameter of ellipse one 
size2 is controlling the diameter of ellipse two
size3 and size4 are controlling the diameter of last ellipse

xi,yi,x1,y1,x2,y2 these are the position of ellipses.

For color selection, I chose my favourite color Red, and lightyellow background.

For 26 letters, each shapes is represented a letter, for instance, first shape in first row is A. 

For numbers, I also make different shapes for ten numbers. For example, first shape in last row that is 0.


Interaction:

For the interaction part, I only add the new function on draw_letter.js and I find some interesting changing and I will
edit the color in next post.
