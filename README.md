Each of my letters consist of 4 cresents made up of 2 arcs each, all based at the center and rotating outward from there. None of the postions are fixed and they all move with the letter and are postioned so they dont overlap most of the time. Some of them do use the fact that they overlap as a feature of the arcs and hide points or even fully behind the other arcs.
When changing letter or number they do cross over each other creating a weird but cool effect for the letters.

The eight parameters per letter:
  * `rot1`: Controls rotation of Arc1
  * `rot2`: Controls rotation of Arc2
  * `rot3`: Controls rotation of Arc3
  * `rot4`: Controls rotation of Arc4
  * `offsetx1`: Controls the X offset of Arc1
  * `offsetx2`: Controls the X offset of Arc2
  * `offsetx3`: Controls the X offset of Arc3
  * `offsetx4`: Controls the X offset of Arc4
  * `offsety1`: Controls the Y offset of Arc1
  * `offsety2`: Controls the Y offset of Arc2
  * `offsety3`: Controls the Y offset of Arc3
  * `offsety4`: Controls the Y offset of Arc4

  I added new parameters for the Y value of the arcs due to when i created some of the letters i found that they were floating above the base line.

  I have also added animation for the letters and i must say they are exactly how i wanted them to be done.
