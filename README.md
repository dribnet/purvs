## MDDN 242 2020 Assignment 2

Monday 04/05/20: Opening github desktop for the first time. Sketching some ideas on how I want to approach this problem set. Changing colours to make sure that commits are working fine.

Wednesday 06/05/20: Sketch a concept idea which uses arcs, triangles, rectangles, ellipses, and lines to re create the alphabet in an abstract way. Planning on using transparency on the fill parts to make the actual letter stand out more for the user. Still thinking on if I want to use a question mark or a exclamation mark for my final character. Imgur link shows my sketch idea - https://imgur.com/a/lC8vumq

Friday 08/05/20: After thinking about my idea and the brief requirements for this problem set, I felt like it wasn't going to work as I was going to be using multiple shapes, and would need a lot more than 20 parameters. Potentially once I get the basic alphabet running, I will experiment will multiple shapes but for now, I'm going to be using rectangles to recreate the alphabet. After not figuring out how to actually get the code working, I finally got the hang of it and now am ready to continue the alphabet after A, B, and C. My next task is to figure out a way to make the rectangles rotate in a way which would use less parameters. I will also be playing with the colours in the future.   

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `topRectW` : top horizontal rectangle width
  * `middleRectW` : middle horizontal rectangle width
  * `botRectW` : bottom horizontal rectangle width
  * `topRectH` : top horizontal rectangle height
  * `middleRectH` : middle horizontal rectangle height
  * `botRectH` : bottom horizontal rectangle height
  * `leftRectH` : left vertical rectangle height
  * `leftRectW` : left vertical rectangle width
  * `rightRectH` : right vertical rectangle height
  * `rightRectW` : right vertical rectangle width
