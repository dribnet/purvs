The yellow on my pattern inspired me to create a landscape that emulates sand dunes in a desert. I have created the base of it and will add more elements later such as changing the colours, adding cacti. 

I have also changed the colour variable on my pattern wallpaper. I felt that the background change would make it more interesting.
