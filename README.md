## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I went and added another colour layer to the map so thay the clouds and the sky and the mountains where seperate textures. For this stage of development I went and made the clouds have a fluffier texture by adding ellipses though the lines. I also made the buildings shift sideways giving them noise to emulate Wellington wind.
