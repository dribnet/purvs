My original idea was from Pok√©mon(Pocket Monsters).

Firstly, it will show many Poke balls at the beginning. When you zoom in to next leverl, it means you will go into the ball to see what it is inside. There will only half Poke balls for this level. Then, when you keep zoomming to next level, Pokemon will show immediately. The Pokemon, marill will appear in the last level.

So far, I updated images keeping their original sizes:	sketch.png(960x720), preview.png (960x500) and thumbnail.png (230x120).
