Big Update

I fixed my code and change the overall look of things, I liked how it looked before with the pinkish/purpely tones on the black background. I removed the white bounding boxes as I felt like they clashed with the stroke of my font. I've also grabbed the exhibition part and need to come up with some words I would like to display. I've added in a question mark, full stop and a comma for the last 3 spaces. 

The eight parameters per letter:
	* 'posx1' : X starting point of bezier
	* 'posy1' : Y starting point of bezier
	* 'posx2' : Second X point of bezier
	* 'posy2' : Second Y point of bezier
	* 'posx3' : Third X point of bezier
	* 'posy3' : Third Y point of bezier
	* 'posx4' : Last X point of bezier
	* 'posy4' : Last Y point of bezier
