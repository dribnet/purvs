## Final

This design is a combination of influences from Gatsby (Art Deco style) and Art Nouveau style. 

After experimentations with the noise function I developed the idea of clouds overlaying a city like scape in an abstract way. 

By figuring out how to make more and more intricate details as you zoom in I wanted to show the pattern become more rounded and take on from the Art Nouveau style more.

Originally I wanted to show more contrast in colour. Ideally I wanted to make a bright contrast that appears the more you zoom in. The idea was to have a populated, polluted cityscape which as you zoom in it goes back more to nature. 

Instead of going with that idea I decided I wanted to keep a more consitent theme with subtler changes. Maybe in the future I could experiment more with different colours.
