Final

For this assignment I wanted to carry on from the work I did on PS3. The space landscape was a good starting point and so i went to work on making a nice layout of stars.
The stars on PS3 were not very efficient and the drawing ran very slowly so I wanted to fix that for this project. Instead of using a for loop to generate the stars, I 
used the sample code provided in class, which went through a set of coordinates to make a unique layout.I further tweaked the layout using the noise funtion. The final 
result is a really nice layout of stars.

The original had used planets in random locations, but I decided to focus on the stars for this project and so the planets did not feature. Ellaborating on the stars, 
I wanted to use a greater variety of star shapes, rather than solely using ellipses. This lead me to developing the pointed star. I used the pointed star on the first
level of the drawing. If the shape is small enough based on cur_ball_radius, it is drawn as a pointed star. As the picture is zoomed, the stars become bigger and are then
drawn as ellipses. The further the picture is zoomed, and outer glow is drawn around the stars, creating a shape similar to a ripple on water.The final level of zoom adds 
detail to the nucleus of the star. 

Working with colour I wanted to use a colour scheme typical to a space landscape. Blues, purples and pinks make up the bulk of the colour scheme, with a nice Navy blue in
the background tying these colours together. The colour scheme changes as the image is zoomed, gradually taking the stars from blue to pink.
