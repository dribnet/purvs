PART 4 - FINAL

My final map code can be found in shakira_map.js

When beginning this problem set I was going to carry on from the last project with my abstract pattern as a starting point. As I started working with the starter code I decided I wanted to change my idea to a 2D map which is reminiscent of the one I created from problem set 3. 

My three graphical sections consist of a cloud layer, a terrain/map layer, and a plant detail layer. While theyâ€™re all abstract I think they communicate the map idea well and the viewer can grasp the overall concept. All layers are generated in the same way and all are based off Tom's 10 print starter code. 

The tour functions shows various points that I think communicate the overall idea the best, and show each of the graphical sections in their own light. 

In further iterations I want to work on creating an ocean section so when the user zooms into the ocean they get a different detail view to the land. I think this will show more variation in the design and really grasp the viewer into exploring for more. While I haven't included this in this version I still think the variation is great enough.
