## Powers of 10 PRINT

My initial direction with this project was to create a design pushing my understanding of the aesthetic capabilities of code.

I established the idea to pursue a computer design with additional zoom levels revealing additional layers of detail within the computer screen. This idea was based on the understanding of the computer computer being made up of networks of wires and components of increasingly small size.

I formed the design in illustrator to help provide a solid design direction in the project. Once I had a design I was happy with I moved into producing the pattern design that would form the basis of the projects design.

Once I had the pattern working in an isolated state the next task was to move the design into the infinite canvas space. This proved quite challenging and was the largest obstacle to overcome in this problem set. 

With the foundation of the pattern working in the canvas space I moved onto producing the computer design. The computer model is based on the Macintosh 128k, and the complementary graphic assets are designed to create the impression of a cluttered desk space.

When I moved into working with higher levels of zoom detail I wanted to make sure that I did not lose the aesthetic that I had established. Therefore I was careful not to create disruptive designs that worked against the simple grid pattern.

This project was ultimately the most challenging of the problem sets, but it was rewarding to form a basic understanding of the scope that is achievable in p5.
