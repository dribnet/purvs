 * p5: the p5.js object - all draw commands should be prefixed with this object
 * x1, x2, y1, y2: draw the pattern contained in the rectangle x1,y1 to x2, y2
 * z: use this as the noise z offset (can be shifted)
 * zoom: current zoom level (starts at 0), useful to decide how much detail to draw
 *
 * The destination drawing should be in the square 0, 0, 255, 255.
