## Powers of 10 PRINT

FINAL 

This code was challenging, we hadnt yet worked with something like this before and the structure is different to what I'm used to. However, it was nice to have a challenge and find a new way of coding. The parameters of this code allowed me to be creative and develop the world I had in mind. I wanted to take what I had done in PS3 in really expand it. I started focusing on the details, as personally the most fascinating feature was the zoom. I decided that in my little universe of bubbles and circles could also be protrayed as molecules. I wanted there to be layers of information and diffeent elements. I created 11 Levels, each introduces a new element that conplements the previous one. My tour is the best way to se how I planend out my levels.The scale of everything as you zoom in is easy to feel by the new elements appearing, as you get closer they are more detailed and specific, I also decided that the closer you get the more structured it is. I kept my initial layer more carefree and random, as you get closer the layout is more grid like, as the elements got smaller I thought this looked best. I stuck with the same colourscheme as I feel it is quite effective, my aesthetic is bubbly and happy, It is also something I believe would work as a large format print, it has enough layers and randomness to it for it to be a landscape/universe but continuous enough to look effective as a print. I did wan thtis work to be abstract and different, instead of copying an already existing map. Overall I found this PS challenging but exciting, and learned a lot from working with this code. 

Bellow are my previous updates.

UPDATE

Im slowly starting to understand how this code works and how to change it, havent quite made too many changes yet but more will come as I analyse the code further. However, i have been able to take it to a point that I like and i feels that I am managing to integrate the code and aesthetic I used for ps3.

UPDATE

I've kept working on my base level for this project and am still getting used to this code, I now have a better idea of where I want to take this project and my next step will be to start adding to my levels and adding further details.

UPDATE

I;ve started adding more details as i get more confortable with the code, the idea is finding worlds insode these bubbles, so ill be building lots of levels, thees still a lot of depth that i want to add.

UPDATE

I've been adding more and more layers as I've gone along, I'm now concentrating on the details when you are quite zoomed in and looking at adding more and more depth to the work.

UPDATE 

I've been really adding to all the layers amd making sure that every time you zoom in you get a different zone and different elements of interest. I'm going to try add as much more as I can and also move on to fixing the 'tour.'

UPDATE

I've now done the tour, I've added a location for each level to really capture the details of all of this the way I wanted. Will still take more time to add more details and elements.

UPDATE

I've now added all the details I wanted and I'm happy with the way the tour is going, I will jsut add a few more details if I have time.
