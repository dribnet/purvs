In designing this environment map, I wanted the viewer to start with an abstract representation of the lily pond, then as they zoom in, the environment will be revealed to them in more detail, with more depth becoming apparent the further in they venture. 

At zoom level 0, the environment appears as an abstract polka-do pattern.

Level 2 begins to show a little more detail, with the shapes of the lily pads coming apparent.

At Level 4, the detailing and shading of the scene comes into focus, and the ripples become an important design feature. 

Level 5 shows the shadows of fish beneath the water's surface, and at level 6, the form of the fish becomes clear.

In order to get the lily pads to look like more than just circles, I added perlin noise to the vertices of the shape. I used the code from this link as a starting point: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/112858
