## Powers of 10 PRINT

I had some problems getting my head around this code, but finally, in the last week it just clicked. After many different variations, some of which you can see in my previous Purview files, I jumped yet again to circles and lines.
My original plan contained too many confusing pieces and variables that didn't work as intended, so I fell back to the simple 80's design of lines and bright colours. I added noise to the stroke weight to give it a subtle, hand-drawn feel. I can not state how nice I find these colours.
