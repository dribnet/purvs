## Powers of 10 PRINT

based on my ps3 coral landscape. 

It was abit of a nightmare. I feel like I could have done better. Im going to keep working on it. 
Its a bit glitchy looking. 

However, the details added feel like you are zooming in so im partly happy.


ZOOM DETAILS:

zoom 0-2 = more cells become visible as you zoom in

zoom 3+ = background darkens -because it feels more microscopic 

zoom 4-5+ = takes a few seconds to load! many more cells appear, varying in color and size!
