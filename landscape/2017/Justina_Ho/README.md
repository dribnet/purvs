## Powers of 10 PRINT

My original idea was a grid where each square is a different colour, being selected at random. As you zoom into one specific square, it reveals the dot pattern and gets more detailed the deeper you go.

I had to make some changes to the grid layout as I experimented with the random idea but it didn't work out the way I wanted. Therefore I changed this by making all the squares one colour and as you zoom in the same happens, a circle pattern appears and gets more detailed as you go closer. 

As you zoom in closer, the background becomes boring as there's no texture. Therefore I decided to add in some white circles and later on, a shape pattern. This is to keep it more interesting.

At the last zoom level, there's two rings that appear on the black dots and a cross hatch pattern that appears on the red dot.
