FINAL

My project was based around the sky of my project 3, but with a bit of a twist. When I was a kid in school you would colour in a piece of paper with lots of colours, paint over it with black, and then scratch through the black to make the colour show through in shapes. I wanted to show a section of space with this, and as you get closer to planets more and more detail is shown.

I found this quite a challenging problem set, as the code you needed to use was slightly more complicated and needed more time to get your head around it. I also struggled a bit with the concept of the noise function, but I think I figured it out in the end.

There is quite a lot of empty space in space, so I didn't populate my canvas as much as I could've. I also liked the effect of some of the clusters of planets, which also mimics clusters in actual space. The colour palette is bright pastel, which were the colours that I would always pick out as a kid.

I only did 5 zoom levels that changed. The tour takes you through them. At the first few levels you only see the stars in the night sky, but as you get closer they start to look like planets, and as you zoom more they reveal a glow around them, along with some of them having moons. If you zoom even closer, some of the planets have craters that reveal more detail as you zoom in.
