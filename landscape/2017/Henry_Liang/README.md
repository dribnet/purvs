## Ps4 Paramaterised Map  


This is a framework that generate parameterised map of space. The program allows user to zoom-in up to ten levels depth to explore the details of nebula and planets. 

The initial idea of this project was transfer my code from PS3 to create an infinite starry sky. By adding more details to higher level of zoom, the view and experience will be changed completely but my goal is making the change more subtle as user zooms in. 

In term of coding, I have used the zoom value to control the saturation of colour, shape, size and density of drawing details to achieve the smooth transition. Additionally, the noise value is used to define different zone of sky, cloud and start. Finally, the drawing angle, colour range and style of star are generate randomly according to the noise value to create the non-repeated pattern as reality.

The guide tour function highlights the change on different zoom levels, the user are able to have a general idea how the detail on map changed time to time.
