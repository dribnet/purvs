## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

This problemset I had a lot of technical issues trying to do my problemset 3 work justice within the bounds of the problemset 4 base code, however my main focus was keeping the colour scheme, and shapes the same or similar. I quickly realised that the wave-like motion of my last problemset would not be very easy to translate, and therefore focussed more on referencing that motion rather than copying it by still having each piece stretch and shrink on the x axis, but with the movement controlled more randomly rather than so mathematically.

With the levels of zooming I just focussed on trying to emphasise elements of the original pattern that are interesting but not necessarily obvious from the first level, such as the layering of the lines making pretty shapes as they crossed over being shown by drawing the pattern twice but once with a smaller stroke so those finer details are obvious. I also chose to re-use an old pattern I had created while getting to my more problemset 3-esque pattern. I had really wanted to have the progression "loop" by re-creating the zoom level 0 as you zoom into the ellipses inside the second pattern, however I think this was a bit too much work as it wouldnt load when i tried to do this, and I imagine this would slow it down even more, which would be a pain as it's already so laggy.

The zooming progression is as follows:

0. Original pattern
1. Dark diamond added
2. Diamond is lightened, inner lines of main pattern is added.
3. Diamond is lightened again
4. Second pattern is added
5. Ellipses are added faintly
6. Orange outer line appears, ellipses get darker, fill enabled.
7. Ellipses appear the same colour as the original background, orange outer lines get thicker

I would have really liked to make a version that reveals more and more layers of patterns drawn in a similar way as the ones I have made in this problemset, I think it would be a cool way to explore the possibilities of drawing a pattern in the way that I did. Unfortunately this would possibly be a bit too much based on my experience with trying to add a third layer of pattern, however I am satisfied by what I have currently.
