FINAL VERSION - A WEEK IN THE LIFE OF A CHRISTMAS TREE

I am happy with my change of design, I really like the idea of 'a week in the life of a christmas tree'.

The tour starts off the week before chirstmas, where the trees are growing in a christmas tree farm (hence the grid formation), in somw snow banks. An addition I added at the last minute was 'snow contours'. I decided to add this in order to give the landscape some subtle dimension.

The tour then goes to zoom in. The contours are gone but there are presents starting to apear (this is supposed to represent a family buying the tree. The next zoom in introduces some more presents, a calendar, and decorations on the tree. The lights are subtly animated. The date is the 23rd, a couple of days before chirstmas.

The next zoom is the 25th, christmas day. There are more presents. 
The next zoom is two days after christmas, the decorations are turned off, and the tree is begining to droop. 

The last zoom is the 31st, the last day of the year. The christmas tree is dead.

If had to have a narrative for this, I would say it shows the commericalisation of christmas, and how fleeting and weird the tradition of having a tree for a couple of days is. In reflection on this asignment, I found the code quite hard at the start. But once I got into it and began to make a decent effort in order to understand it, it was very easy to use. The code for the animation was a little confusing but I ended up basing my code of the example code, so it was fine. 

the only thing that I couldnt get working in the end, was importing font. I wanted to improt a pixel font for the calendar, but It didn't end up working :(

I have really enjoyed these last two years in creative coding, it has definitly been my favourite course so far. Thank you Tom and Pheobe for making it so fun, and for helping me make cool things for my portfolio :)

I have made the skeleton. I also made every zoom smaller by one, as when I zoomed in to the last zoom it was too close. I also have made a calendar which apears on the 23rd, 25th, 27th, 31st.

I have made the zoom for 7 begin to make the tree look like it is 'decaying'. I have also staggard the adition of presents so that they add in the 'lead up' to christmas. I think the things I will add after this point, is the skeleton on the tree (on zoom 8), and I will also add a calendar. If I have time I will add a background other than white.

I have added some presents, I will probably make more details on them in the future. Like a bow, ribons, ect. I will also want to fade them in a bit more.

I For this commit, I have added using tom's movement code (kind of) for the staments. I have added christmas lights. I changed the circles to rectangles and put more coordernates into the array to do this. I also have added snow onto the branches rto give it a more winter feel. The only problem with the animation thoughg is that it makes the window slow :(. It works fine when the window is small. but will not work or be extremely glitchy at fill screen. I guess this is not something I could easily optimise though, so it will just have to do.

The last things I need to do are to make the presents, and to make the date calendar thing. I think it would be a cool idea to still incorporate a skiier, or even the snow down to a molecular level. But I will put these on the back burner to implement until my exam is over. If I do end up doiing these it will probably be too close to thr due date to do perfectly.

I have added the detail features on the tree. You can see in the image that I have also changed the shadow around the bottom to a pixel circle instead of a real circle. Just to have some continuity

The next commit I do will be the lights and the star probably.

Created a christmas Tree grid

I had created a non zoomable christmas tree origionally, and had help from pheobe to put it into my grid. I think I am going to change my idea a little though. 

I want to do a sort of 'week in the life of a christmas tree'. What will happen, is the user will zoom in on a christmas tree farm. (i.e a uniform grid of trees which look exactly the same). The further the user will zoom in, the further they will get into the christmas time line. On the second zoom in you will see more details of the tree, including a shadow (in pixel form) and some snow on the branches. The next zoom will be a star on the top of the tree (representing the person has bought the tree and is decorating it). The next will be lights which will be animated and move and blink in a random order. the next zoom will be presents. The very last zoom will be the tree, skelleton, or the process of the tree dying. 

The narrative for this I suppose could be the commericalisation of christmas, and how everything is dumped after december 25th. I may if I have enough time include like a pixel calendar or something which pushes this narrative a little more.
