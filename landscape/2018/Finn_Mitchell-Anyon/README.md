## FINAL VERSION

Note: Takes a while to load. Approximately 1,500,000 cells are randomly generated each time the program is loaded.

For this final version I incorporated a new system for determing cell colour and stroke width.

The main cell will always be white. When you zoom in to the second level, each cell has a randomly selected hue. Zooming in to the third level, each cell has a colour derived from its parent cell, only slightly altered to give some natural variation.

Stroke width now correlates directly with the cell's on-screen radius. This means that larger cells also have visibly thicker rings. I found that this actually helped to create the trypophobic impression I was originally going for.
