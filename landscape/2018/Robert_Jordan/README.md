Final

I wanted to use overlapping semi-transparent shapes to make interesting patterns. I am quite happy with what I have produced. I think the diamonds create a really cool kaleidoscope effect.
Initially there are only a few diamonds creating a fairly simple pattern. As you zoom in more diamonds are added, with different sizes. This creates more complex and interesting patterns. After zooming further they begin dissappearing again, returning to simplicity.
I think the animation works well, it is only a simple movement but the repetition creates complex patterns. 
There is no randomness programmed into my code but I think there is still an element of randomness, because the patterns created by the overlap are not really planned by me. They are procedual, generated by the variations in size and the movement of the animation.
Overall, I am happy with the result.
