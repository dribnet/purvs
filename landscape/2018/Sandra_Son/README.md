FINAL

I carried on my idea from my previous project. I wanted to play with 2d forms changing to a 3d form. 

The animation aspect is quite simple. I wanted to keep the same motion as I did in my previous project as I think it's quite effective. After completing this I wanted to add another layer of animation on the second level of zoom as I thought this would add more interest. I decided to do the cube inverted.

Finally I changed the colour scheme but still kept it bold as the shapes are simple and I think this works well.
