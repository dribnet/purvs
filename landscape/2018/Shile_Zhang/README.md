## PS4 MDDN 342 2018

This is my real final version. I had done few part changed from my last version.
1.I added one more animation for the zoom 4

I have five zoom in layers.
0: Chocolate box
1: Open the box, you can see the chocolate
2: Chocolate shaking in the box
3: Chocolate with almond filling
4: Cutie almond animation (hhhh

New Technical issues compared with last one

In this final version, I added the rotate animation in it. The animation makes my design more lively.

However, I give up to add almond detail for the zoom 4. In my previous versions, I used two points to set up my lines. Once I applied the rotate animation in my line, it worked not smooth at all. Then I remove the detail for it only left the rotate animation.

I didn't do too many changes compare with my last version.

Overall

In the beginning, this project is quite hard to understand the map location. Once I understand how the code works, everything solve easily.

However, the rotate and translate function is not working as same as other projects.

Overall, I learnt more about how to control my shapes.
