Final Version 
My final version reflects the vision I had from the sketch. I wanted more petal details to appear as it got more zoomed in. I wanted the poppies to be randomly scattered to represent their natural form and composition. The opacity brightens the petals as you zoom up, and then fades away again once the inverted flower in the middle becomes apparent. 
I struggled to understand the code and therefore limited myself when it came to asethetic details and drawing capabilities but the circles still reflect roses/poppies and execute the intention.
