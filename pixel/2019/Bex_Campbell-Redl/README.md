## Nostalgia

My chosen theme for this assignment is my childhood home. Recently I went back to visit my family and friends in austria (where i spent a large part of my childhood). And while I was there i took advantage of the spring weather and went for walks around my village. The area where I come from is small and very rural and so i thought using the photos i took of the area without people was appropriate.

The images i chose were the Maypole in the town square which when i was a kid was a park but now it is home to the village council building

the second image is of the old roads that have now been turned into bike paths that criss cross the country side and serve as an easy way to walk or bike from town to town.

The final image is of an old memorial on the side of one of the bike paths with a much newer bench.

For my images i wanted to create a dreamlike aesthetic but also use elements to highlight the growth and space. 

I used a single mask with varied colors to create depth.

I created my look by using a grid to map the pixels and using 2d primitives to create shapes as well as drawing lines using controlled randomness to create a softer, more dream like and wild texture.
