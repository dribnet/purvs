## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final 

My theme was based on around friends/family and nature, more specifically rain. 

Throughout the process of this assignment I wanted to create an interesting reveal effect, In the end, I settled for this rain effect that I quite liked and distorted the image in an interesting way. Keeping with the water/rain theme I decided to extend this a splash effect to reveal the subject.

Overall, I'm somewhat happy with the final result. However, I wish I could improve the overall vibe of the output images. At one point I was trying to generate a Vah Goth type style image, so I would like to retry that in the future if possible.
