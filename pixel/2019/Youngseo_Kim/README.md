## MDDN242 PS4 : CUSTOM PIXEL

 The name of my artwork is 'Self-Love'. I have been living in New Zealand for four months and have changed lots of things such as my lifestyle, thoughts, values and much more. The most thing that changed to me is that I became free from the others. The Korean society forced people to consider others rather than ourselves. So, I always had to make my appearance and see other people's eyes. However, after I came to New Zealand, I am having less time to improve my appearance and behavior. I have never seen anyone who makes a point of my appearance or says rude words. Finally, I learned how to express myself just the way I am. 

 This assignment was especially planned to be exhibited, so I decided the theme to be "Me". I want to get the energy to live confidently like now even I return to Korea by exhibiting my existence on the Wellington Street.

 The three photos are special for me. It is an analog film photo that someone who I love took me on a trip. One photo is by my mother, One is by my boyfriend, and one is by my self. This means that I am not only loved by myself, but also by others.

 In addition, I am drawing some illustration as a hobby. I have an unique painting style which is giving the colors only on nose and cheeks. I tried to put a pink and orange pattern on the nose and cheeks in my photo just same as my illustrations. It was a fun work to me.
