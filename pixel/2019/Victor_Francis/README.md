### To Smell The Roses

SideNote Some pushes have'nt gone through especially most of my readmes,After the whole paper I still cant fully grasp the task of pushing properly sad days,sad days indeed


Final Readme


For me the line between reality and technology is becoming harder to differentiate between. Looking at all aspects of life we are surrounded by screens. What is truly sad is that we have become dependant on technology. As a Media design student, most of my work is done on a screen. But this doesn't stop me from seeing the aesthetic of nature. What I wanted to highlight was the increasing lack of recognition of the beauty around us daily.

The saying "to stop and smell the roses" to me means to take time out of one's busy life to enjoy or appreciate the beauty in life. I wanted to convey the idea that most of the natural beauty we see online is most likely altered, discouraging the natural aesthetic. In a world where we are neglecting nature with pollution and non sustainable practices, we now have the most to lose.

Photography
What I wanted to use to portray my idea of natural beauty and how we neglect it was flowers. I  mainly looked towards capturing the form and colour that flowers hold. Wanting to show how technology has distracted us from the aesthetic of natural beauty I used a phone. Having the main flower located within the phone then having a repeated flower pattern really does highlight the beauty we miss by looking at our phone.

Dither
The main attribute for my project was to highlight the flower by drawing attention away from it. As bizarre as this seems it highlights that we should be focusing on the world outside of our screens. But the question was how do I draw focus away and towards something? I looked into the technique of dither. Using this almost noise/static influenced aesthetic it acts as sort of a blur for my image. Having it grey really does strip the flower of its colour aspect, which flowers are well known for.

The background of the flower is a grid of randomly drawn lines, this creates an interesting background that draws the person's eye to the phone by since its just lines this promotes the viewer to look outside the phone,which is what my project is all about.


Conclusion
Essentially my simple 3 mask design does exactly what I wanted it to do. By drawing the viewerâ€™s attention to the centre but leaving out aspects that make it interesting (e.g colour) the viewer has little room to not be drawn away by the colour of the flowers on the outside of the phone. We as a human race draw closer to the possibility of a world without natural beauty. Barren forests, pollution and no flowers is a world I wouldn't want to experience. Appreciating what we have because we don't know how long it will be around.

Just want to thank Caitlin Sue for helping me proof read my readme(she forced me to put this in).
