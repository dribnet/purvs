Theme: I use a high-pixel mask to blur the background so that the object to be expressed can be more noticeable.
I also used a high contrast color to highlight the thing which I going to express.

From the beginning, I have chosen a photo which cannot express my theme very well, so I used another photo which has a clean background.

I used rect to draw the background, ellipse to draw Dana.
