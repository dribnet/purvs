Final
The images above are photos of my parents and me traveled together in Cambodia on the last holiday. It shows one of the most important things to me- "family".
Because Angkor Wat style walls look like frames, my parents and I seem to be in natural frames. Even though we are in different places, the love will last forever like a picture. 

I used horizontal squares to form the background of three pictures, and my parents and I looked like in oil paintings. Then, we are regarded as the main body of the picture, and the human part is composed of a slender ellipse with vertical intersection. After adjusting the data over and over again, I think the final picture looks very harmonious and the two patterns will not conflict.
