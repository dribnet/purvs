## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My project portrays stress through a project night. Taking into account the possibility of these works being displayed on the 3 boards outside the university, I believe that this is an image that everyone studying here can relate to. As for it being displayed on the large monitor, working class people can also relate to the feelings portrayed in these works.

The work is in a sequence, transitioning through someones feelings as they are consumed by the computer screen that they have spent hours upon hours looking at. The look of strain and tiredness come across through the images.

I chose to keep the code simple, as the message needs to be read through the image. The code was instead used as a way to obscure the image, and put across the consumption feeling.
