## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In this project, I took the inspiration from "Thangka", which is a colorful Tibetan Buddhist painting on cotton, silk, usually depicting a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala. Thangka used an ancient craft that combination of embroidery, appliqué and other techniques to weaving the patterns on top.

 I find some photos that I toke in Japan a few years ago. I think the contrast of color looks great in those photos, which suit the "colorful" of thangka. I want the whole image looking hazy but organized, so I used stroke rect to make the background and show the nice detail of the original photo. Use paralleled lines to highlight the embroidery texture of the pictures. It almost have the texture of printed woolen blanket as the background, and the mask part are slightly raised embroidery lines.
