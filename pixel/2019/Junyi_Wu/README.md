## When Were We Last Comfortable?

My idea was inspired by a Jubilee video, where they asked 50 random people of different ages the same question - "If you could change one thing about your body, what would it be?" Almost all adults gave answers that showed how common it is for people to feel uncomfortable in their own skin, whereas all the young children interpreted the question differently by giving positive, imaginative answers. The adults wanted to lose a trait they had, whereas the children wanted to gain something.

I chose to create silhouettes to represent people, specifically women, in general as it's a common topic in the society, rather than referring to specific people. In the first image, there is a woman who wants to become skinny (depicted through the shadow), as she is ashamed in wearing a large sized dress. For the second image I was going to do a teenager who was stressed/upset, but what I had before seemed to be misleading. Then I changed it to an aged woman's face. The highlights in the first two panels (the chubby figure and wrinkles) are what they would change about their body, but the lines are also meant to embrace those features. In the last panel, there is a little girl who would want to have wings so that she can fly, which is a contrast with the first two pictures.

I mainly chose this theme because I found the Jubilee video quite interesting, but then I realised that in a way I also find it relatable. I've always had a skin condition, so while growing up I've become more conscious of my skin appearance because of being afraid of judgement.

I would have liked to develop my images more, but I currently don't have an idea on how. However, overall I think my images portray the idea. When all three are put together, they show the theme completely because there is the child in the third panel, but individually the idea on general body image can still be seen.
