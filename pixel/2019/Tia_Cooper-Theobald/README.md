## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this project I kept to a theme of ocean pollution. For the code I made the background a simple shape either and ellipse or a rectangle. For the focus of the image I made a basic bottle shape using rectangles, I used that to fill in the space. I did this to try show how much ocean pollution there really is. For the last two images they have the bottle code in the sections of ocean, to help show the idea that the ocean is just filled with waste. The first image has a silhouette of someone stuck in the sand made of bottles. I guess the message behind this one is that the pollution is taking over and its gonna take over us if we don't do something about it. I had fun with this project if I had more time I would of probably experimented more with the silhouette on the other images.
