## PS4 - Custom Pixel - "Theme - Passionate"

FINAL - My chosen theme is passionate. I chose this theme as I wanted to do something about myself rather than something that is public. I wanted to express my passion for commitment towards ensuring my projects and creation are spot on/nicely displayed. For implementing this into PS4, I decided to create and use effects based upon each images objects. Eg. First image shows a paper made prototype. For this, a simple black background was made. 2nd image - is pretty much my wood toy project. I wanted this is be the main image so I decided to stick it in the centre. For this I chose to create a blocky/pixel art effect based on the toy and it's shape. Same goes for my third image for sketching, made a effect based upon the paper and pencil. If I had the time, I would probably make my main image (image 2) more outstanding by having some unique text on top. 

Problems - purview doesn't like my home laptop/computer...whenever I upload onto the purview, it doesnt proceed/upload...

Cons - nothing except that I also had a project I needed to work on which involves Unity + VR which got me into a stressful time in entries..
