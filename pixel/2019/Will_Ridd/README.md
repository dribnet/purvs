My theme for my final code is boundless, I want to show different images of areas with large mountains or areas that have one large feature within the image for example mountains seas or rocks. for all the images i used a mixture of areas, the first one is from Taupo NZ, the second is also from Taupo and the last one is from Wellington. the reason I chose this as my theme is that I really enjoy taking photos of the environment and landscapes because they can just look spectacular if taken correctly. The final iteration of my code shows the mask in in ellipses and the background also in those ellipses, I also changed the background colour to make the mask and the background of the image stand with  more definition on the details in the image that I used
