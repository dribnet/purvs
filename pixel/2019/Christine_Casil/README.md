## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final 

For my final I decided to use a tile look for my images as I was able to achieve a good contrast between the background and the subject. I made it so there was a black outline for the background and I orginally had smaller squares when it drew the person in the image but I changed it slightly so it was only the outline that drew the person. I played around with the back and white so the person was outlined in white and the background was outlined with black. The images for my final were photos I took myself of people I care about and I wanted to place close attention on their facial experssion and body language. I wanted to clrealy show their faces that's why I outlined them and made them stand out more.
