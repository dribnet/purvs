## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Theme - Nostalgia

This is the final result of my project. The elements I added are "patches", every photo has one on the important parts. My idea is that there is something you are familiar with but untouchable. For the whole frame, I created an atmosphere of isolation and confusion. For nostalgia, I don't focus on the missing part but the pain.

Elements

White space with lines & folds - I considered them as old pictures, they should be seemed from a long time ago. Therefore, folds show how long the photos have existed and the white space on the left is like the photo is torn off by somebody.

Patches - I think miss home is like patch something. You need to "patch" the memories in order to feel better. The truth is it is just fantasy. If you miss something you can never have it back cuz it is already gone. These patches indicate the missing parts and passed time.

I feel just satisfactory of my final result. It's struggling to test my different versions, some of the codes are not working well and others just simply inviable. My initial idea is to make a function of connected lines like a cobweb. Ultimately, it didn't look beautiful at all and it is not even a web. Then I felt frustrated and just test some effects that easy to make. The final one is actually the composition of my experiments.
