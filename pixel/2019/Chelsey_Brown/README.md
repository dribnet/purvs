## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final
These are the finals for my photographs. I decided to continue on with the same design for each image, but altered them to suit each individual photograph. I also wanted to make the code clear and easy to understand, so I split the code into 3 different parts. A section of code for each photograph. I looked at my peers work as well as art works and readings to gather a better understanding of the project requirements.
