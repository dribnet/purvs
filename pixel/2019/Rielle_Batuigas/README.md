## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this project, I have decided to choose sunset as my theme. The reason for choosing this is because it is something significant to me. I love watching the sunsets alone. Every sunset is different to me, either the colour, the cloud allignments and even how bright or dim the sun is. I always like the different style sunsets have. Back in Nelson, my hometown, I live in the mountain and the balcony has a very lovely view of the beach, mountains and sun. It's a very nice place to relax and watch. I have used the photos I took when I went on a holiday. From what I have noticed each picture is different from what I have mentioned, colours, brightness and allignment. Therefore I have used my top 3 photos. I have pixelated it into ellipse and an arc shaped like a half-moon.  For the mask, I have highlighted the different things that isn't part of the sun. 

From the first one starting on the left, it's a normal sunset photo. It's the usual yellow orange-y colour. For this, I have pixelated it small so you can still see the photo a bit. For the mask, I have highlighted the lighthouse. This is because it is not part of the sunset.  The second one, which is the middle picture, I have masked the bottom part of the picture, this part is the houses and beach. The third photo, which is the right photo, i have masked the clouds. This is because the clouds are covering the sunset.

The photos are in sync to when I have captured them. From left to right. I captured them in the same month but different each week. And what you can also see is that the colour of the pictures goes from light to dark and the sun going more down.

In my opinion, I am okay with the result of the assignment but I feel like there's still more work to be done on it.
