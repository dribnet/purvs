## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images 1 and 3 above are photos of the street of Penang, Malaysia and image 2 is a photo of a boat canal tour in Bangkok Thailand. These three images were from my Southeast Asia trip in 2018 and I thought this would be a great theme for this last project . The masks for each photo highlight the streets,water, and the sky. I wanted the sky to have this fading out effect wihtout completely disolving it into the background, reason why I had the ellipses in this small grid-like pattern. For the buildings and boat, I primarily wanted this pixelated square design. Although, the design that I have now was a 'happy accident' that happened through the process of creating the square pixels I primarily wanted. After creating the design for the buildings and the boat, I still wanted this square pixelated square effect, and so the result for the streets and the water design.
