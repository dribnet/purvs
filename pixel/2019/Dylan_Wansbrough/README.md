## FOREVER EVOLVING

---------------------------------

## Final Update
So my final idea was "Forever Evolving". A statement on how we treat and use technology in society as it constantly becomes obselete due to plan obsolescence or the passage of time. The ArtWork 1 is there to show how technology has grown. The image contains 3 different hand held Nintendo Devicees. Each one gets bigger as time passes and you can see the new features they added. Such as a second screen or in the newest case they even removed the folding aspect. Even then though with the Nintendo Switch teres a new one planned for 2020 making the switch slowly become more devalued. With Artwork 2 its a stack of phones old and new. I stacked the phones with the oldest phones on the bottom and getting newer up until a iphone 8 on the top. This is just a show of how many phones my family has gone through that we even held on to. We go through phones so quickly as a society. The final picture is VR. Something that was ment to be the next big thing but hasnt taken off yet if ever. So I made the look to show how what was ment to be the next thing is already becoming a thing of the past.

## Progress 2
Ive finished taking my images and refind all the masks to best fit the image. Iv tried to best portray my idea of Forever Evolving, Trying to show how technology is ever evolving and becomign obselete either by plannec choice or by the passage of time. Its hard to show things so the viewer will see them and recognise that its new technology but becoming old. 

## Progress 
My theme is forever evolving.

I have got my photo to start appearing in sepia. It was a pain but Ive mapped it too the lightness and now I need to look at making it look damaged then polishing it from there. I always want to make differet masking layers for different colours of damage.

Current changes is the random dots are now a lighter colour not white. White was to hard on the picture.

## Idea 
So my idea is taking a image and making it look like a old timey photo. I want to take photos of modern tecnology and make them look like old pictures. This is to show the porgression of technology and how what we have now will soon be an obselete technoology. I would do this by changing the colours of pixels to make it look greyscale or old brown tinted photos. I would use the mask to mark where to make scracthes and scuffss etc. 

## My curent Ideas
I missed a couple classes so I've been trying to get back on track. Looking through all of the stuff the one that really stood out to me was Ryan Alexanders work. The white or whitish image on a dark background I feel couold be a realy interesting tool to explore. In Ryans case I think the image comes out kinda old looking and that is kinda intersting. I just did a little testing with it.

## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
