## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel 

In The Cloud!

For this project, the theme I've picked is "In the Cloud". I think the name of it is best to describe my personality. I'm a type of person that is not paying much attention to what is happening around me, and usually, my attention is on my own thoughts, or my head is filled with unrealistic ideas. In a way, I'm a really dreaming/unrealistic person (daydreaming).  

These photos were taken a while ago, but each of the photo has their own timeline. The first one was 4 years ago, the 3rd one was 3 years ago and the 2nd photo was last year. Well, from the look of it I guess I'm less dreaming now as the year goes by. I put the last year photo in the middle because its represent me at my current stage. 

The smoke was used to partly cover the face and also to create an illusion of cloud and dreamy. It was quite hard to mask the smoke and code it so it would flow with the rest of the image. Therefore, I only used simple shapes such as ellipses, rectangles, triangle, and lines. The smoke I would either use rectangles or ellipses because I think it suits best to create an illusion of gradient/fading out effect. Then the rest I based on the texture of the image.
