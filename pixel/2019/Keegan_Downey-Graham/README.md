## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Title - POP DUPLICATES


The 3 images I have used are:
1 - A photo I have taken of my little brother at lorenzen bay, Raglan.
2 - Sunset at Ngarunui beach, Raglan.
3 - Top of my house.

For my images I have focused on abstracting the image by duplicating the silhouette of the subjuct in the photo (done in the masking process) to create a cool and interesting effect which creates a constant flow and brings all the images together when looked at on the whole. I also had grabbed some inspiration from pop art.
