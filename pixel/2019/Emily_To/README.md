## Courtenay Places of East Asia

I chose to use 3 images I took of some of the busiest nightlife spots in 3 different countries in Eastern Asia - Hong Kong, Vietnam and Thailand (from left to right). I chose 3 images I took from a similar perspective with an ongoing depth of field to compose a consistent theme across my images.

I decided to create a mask where the sky is in each image. Where the image is masked, rounded squares of the original colour of the image are drawn to create a mosaic-tile grid. 
In unmasked areas, I tried to use an opposite approach of drawing the image to create some drastic contrast. I used various, small, unfilled-squares of the original colour of the image to create a pixeled-particle look. 
From this, I tried to portray an alternate dimension between the sky and everything on the ground.

Originally the background between the tiles was black in all 3 images but made the tiles blend together/ made the mask virtually invisible. I've changed the backgrounds of each image to be slightly tinted towards the main colour palette of each image (blue, pink and orange). This helps differentiate the tiled areas.
