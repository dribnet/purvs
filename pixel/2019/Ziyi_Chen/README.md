## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The theme of my photo is to explore the relationship between people and their subconscious.
The first photo is a person who sees himself holding a lighter from his own eyes.
The second photo is a superposition of photos of a moving body that a person is conscious at different times. Because it is difficult for people to maintain the same posture, each different movement represents a subconscious of different moments.
The third photo is the two reactions of the same person when she see the human skeleton model.

I used three unused codes, the focused part is represented by a star pattern, the background part is represented by the pixels of the dot, and the slash is used to indicate the dynamic concept.
In the first photo, I added a pattern of slender triangles to the flame to create a sense of friction and movement. In the second photo, I used this triangular pattern on the part of the girl's body, emphasizing a feeling of movement.




The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
