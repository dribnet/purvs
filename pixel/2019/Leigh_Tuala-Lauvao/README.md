THEME: PASIFIKA IN AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND

- Intro:
I have chosen this as my final. The theme of this whole project for me was a cultural theme. This theme stemmed from the fact that it was Samoan Language Week last week so I wanted to do something culturally relevant to that, but also relevant and relatable to myself. 

- Theme 1.0:
Pasifika Identity in Aotearoa New Zealand is forever evolving. The diversity within New Zealand, particularly Wellington, amazes me because of how much it has become a part of New Zealand. I was born in New Zealand but am full Samoan and my identity becomes unclear at times due to not knowing a huge amount of knowledge about my culture. My family are a huge part of my life and family overall is a very sacred value in Samoan culture. 

- Theme 1.1:
Throughout this project I used a range of images from my family home album that are sort of "monumental" in a way to ymy family. They are hugely active in all things cultural as well as sports such as basketball, netball and softball. With the three final images I chose, I wanted to show the 'old generation' and then the 'newer generation'. The first two images are of my uncle roughly 20 years ago performing a cultural Samoan dance at his high school. The last image is from roughly 3 years ago of my younger sister and cousin after their performance. What this shows to me is a growing generation that has been inspired by older generations to participate in such exhilarating activities.

- Masks:
Using photoshop I began masking out the subjects themselves as a starter point. As I further developed my idea and looked at other work for inspiration, I started to mask oout parts of the background, also making the masking edges harder or less harder according to how well it turned out on the server. I used basic white and black as that is what we had to do, however, I thought why not implement patterns in my masks. Patterns and symbols are another huge part of Samoan culture, they are representative of things such as family, culture, respect- values similar to those. I chose a flower that I have on my tattoo which represents family, using it as a background to further expand my theme of pasifika identity.

- Code:
Lastly, the code I had at first was experimental. I then looked online and watched a few youtube videos to figure out how else I can develop my code. Started off using simple rect and ellipse shapes but then I progressed to trianges- triangles or "arrowheads" are symbols in Samoan patterns, representing strength and "mana". Using the triangles I wanted them to show, so using the tiles class example I included triangles for the background and kept rectangles for the actual subjects. I played around with this, as seen in my commits, and I was indecisive on how I wanted the overall image to look. However, once I added fill and adjusted the tiles I came to an overall look that I was happy with (this one in the final). The colour was a bright red-orange at first but then I decided to use a green to represent the university colours. White grids of rectangles cover the subject and to me it just brings the subjects out way more but also creates a different effect.

- To Conclude:
I am happy with my final. I have added more than 3 final commits for my purview to show a development process of this project. The aim of this to be honest was to not only "get a good grade" but to also make my fmaily proud. I hope that the code implemented is enough to show what the actual image is as well as the background patterns.
