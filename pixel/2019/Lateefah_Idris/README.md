## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Overall design process:

Initially in my process I started of with the idea of playing with sunrise, day and night. Then I developed my idea to showcase key parts of Wellington and its culture as the billboard is being shown in town. My first photo is to highlight Wellingtons hills and scenery. The second photo is of a Hurricanes game taking place in the Westpac Stadium to express Wellingtons sporting culture. The third photo is of boats on the wharf as an expression of the towns fishing culture. 

Throughout my process I wanted to play with extending the colours to add noise. 

For the sunrise photo I added lines coming off of the clouds to add movement, then I vertically stretched out the mountains and buildings as if they are being moved by the wind and to be an abstract way of displaying movement within the city.
The second photo I extended the lines out from the crowd to abractly express them yelling. I made the field out of round ellipses to contrast with the sharp ellipses coming off the crowd.

 My last image I extended the lines all the way off of the boats to create a visual dynamic movement with the boats and the abstract wind, I also made the lines very skinny so elements like the moon and the hills can still be seen coming through.

Overall there is a slight gradient theme going across my three images as it goes from orange to green to blue, following the colour spectrum. 

A problem I had while developing my images was when overlaying the textures I was trying not to make it too busy and for it to still be readable as an image. I overcame this by making the lines thinner and making them not extend too far. If I were to develop this project further I would experiment more with the shapes and layers of the mask to convey deeper meanings. Also trying to make to the images feel more connected as one piece of work.

Overall I am happy with my images, I think the windy and noisey theme throughout them works well.
