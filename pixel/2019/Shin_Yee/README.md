## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final:

These are my three final pixel pictures. The theme is Street Music. This idea was inspired by street artist. I got this idea when I was walking around the waterfront and I saw a lot of the street artist playing different instruments. Another inspiration was from the public piano in waterfront. I saw the people passing by and starting to play the piano. Everyone can show their talents and also have their own music stage anywhere and anytime. This is how I got this idea. As for the design of my pixels, I have tried to use different shapes and different ways to present my pictures. Overall, I am satisfied with my final output.
