## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Final Commit

Overall for this project the theme i selected was Time and how it is constantly
changing and evolving, as it keeps moving forward with the things around us that
are both natural and manmade. I have explored this in this project through my
final 4 images for example the tides in the oceans change and evolve throughout
the day from the tides being in or out which are caused by the gravitational
forces of the moon sun and also rotation of the earth, this occurs on a daily basis
all throughout time as it continues to move indefinitely. I also looked at the
evolution of the buildings and landscapes over the years to showcase how time has
progressed while comparing buildings from old to the new to show how manmade
buildings have progressed through time and history.

For my final custom pixel I decided to use lines and layers that blend well
with my images where it can still capture the landscape detail really well
with the line pixels in the mask and non mask area being used to still capture
what i took from the original photographs that convey my main theme and idea.
