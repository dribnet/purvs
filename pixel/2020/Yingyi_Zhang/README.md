My theme is to show the similarity of people living on this earth. I chose photos of the scenery of Japan, Morocco, and New Zealand. Then use masks to create the human figure. In the picture, there are wingsuit flying people, people with an umbrella, and people with rowers.

Human lives their lives in various places on the earth, with different living environments and different living habits. Life may be plain or passionate. Even if there is such a huge difference, everyone has the same emotions. We will cry when we are sad, laugh when we are happy, and we all have the same beating heart. People are similar and equal.

I adjusted the color of the photo to an exaggerated blue with strong contrast. In this way, three pictures taken at different places and at different times will have certain similarities. Pink, white, and yellow are the colors of shapes and lines. I tried to make the three pictures look more lively through the color scheme.

I created three layers through black, white, and gray masks. I used the grid for the layers of character and background. In previous attempts, I tried to use random and dice to create a background with a blurry effect, but the result was not good. So I used the grid to make the background more orderly, while not weakening the character layer. The characters are composed of hearts, while the yellow lines are composed of stars. Simple symbols not only have symbolical meaning but also make the final result look more digital. The yellow line runs through the three pictures and represents a connection.
