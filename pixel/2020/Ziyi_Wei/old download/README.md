## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final: Ghost town
For the final one,I choose this topic to reflect our world is build by two side---
dark and light sides. The we alway pay attendtion on good side. the dark side people
can not keep a watchful eyes on it for the long time, which is like
the old  ghost town that is forgot in the corner in our memory.
  I add some color to add color in every pictures to make all the
pictures in the one style. At the custom pixel, I choose rectangle and line to be the
fliter . Filling the line make the picture can make the picture to be vantage. And
grey color to show the dark atmosphere. rectangle pixel can use for highlight. I use
more time to add some color to show the two side of our world. one is colorful and beeautiful
part. another one is dark side. all the photo come from my daliy life, and three photo are
there places, so it can show different perspectives in our world. Therefore, it can include
more factor to build "ghost town".
