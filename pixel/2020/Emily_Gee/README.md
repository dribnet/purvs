## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

This project really taught me how images could be represented differently.
Having done an engineering paper in image processing and working with a lot of pixels and what not I felt that I already knew how pictures were created.
But with this project I've been stretched to explore different ways in which we are able to present images that aren't just in the square pixel forrmat. 
If i were to do this project again I think I would have liked to have been able to create my own images using photoshop to stitch together photographs so that I'd have more creative freedom.
