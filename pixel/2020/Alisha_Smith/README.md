## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My work focuses on enhancing the soft contours and dreamy aesthetic of nature. I wanted my strokes to replicate oil paint and bring out the soft yet vibrant colouring of my images. Purple is a very prominent colour in my work, I used it to link all my images together, this can be seen that I recoloured a few plants in my second image.

I used a grid technique to add more elements to my work. Adding in the curved pops of purple helped elevate the idea of a dreamscape, creating the notion of looking through something to a very hazy image.

Whilst working through this project, I never strayed too far from my concept of a romanticised image. Earlier on in my work I stuck very strictly to this idea, and wanted to replicate only paintings. But after further working I found my work to 'missing' something. I very much liked the purple aspects of my images, it added the extra pop without contrasting too much from the initial image. Finding a colour was a bit difficult as I was trying to find a balance, orange was a second choice, I decided on purple as I felt it was a bit more subtle and worked more with my theme.

I've taken images from a recent visit to the Auckland Botanical Gardens, this place is very special to me. I absolutely love nature and landscapes. After experimenting with a more abstract approach, I want my works to represent how we've lost our ability to be at one with nature. We live in a fast-paced world viewing screen after screen, it alters how we view what was once so normal to us.
