## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

MDDN242 Project 3 Custom Pixel (Part 4) Final 

This is my final for project 3.

| Theme:
The theme is Wellington's 2020 New years festival. I decided to use this theme because it is very relevant to Wellington and the festival was held early this year before quarantine. The purpose of this theme is to highlight the Wellington Community. This was a free event that anyone was welcome to attend and Wellington offers large spaces to bring the community together. Now would be the perfect time to display these images to a billboard because New Zealand has successfully overcome covid-19 and these images would be a great reflection of the memories made earlier this year and the community can look forward to more events now we can go back to living a normal ifestyle.

| Photos:
1. Paper Lanterns
2. Blow up Duck
3. Blow up Fish

| Decisions: 
I edited the first image with the lanterns because it didn't match the other two images as they had dark background so I changed it from blue to dark gray. I also slightly edited the fish photo because this photo was a closeup image and it showed too much colour compared to image 1 & 2 so I coloured some parts of it black to balance out how much visible colour it was producing.

In the beginning I wasn't sure what type of pixel design I should follow through with and I was mostly doing experiments. In one of my experiments I realise I liked the gridding technique because it made my images look very clean and sharp. It didn't make my images look random; I could still see what they were. This is the style I decided to go with and you can see in my final there is a lot of gridding going on in the background but I experimented with two different types. My background was very flat so I decided to add a minor 3D element which are the circles. I duplicated the circle and added a small number to the x and y value to move it lower and gave it a fill colour with low opacity so it looked like a shadow instead whcih created this button look. Negative space was not planned but I included it which was affective because it make my images relate to each other more because the layout was consistent. I didn't like how wide these images were supposed to be so I believe using ngative spacing on the sides made the banner seem smaller than it actually is. The other consisitent thing I wanted to keep was the grid following a wave form. It is supposed to represent water for the duck and fish but the sky for the lanterns. I kept the blue very light because the main focus are the colour objects and I didn't want the background to take away from that.

In my final I ended up with 4 different shades on my mask because I liked the style of layering and some parts of my image needed to display a different style of pixel so they weren't clashing with each other. An exmaple would be the white veritcal lines vs the blue horizonal lines, at firs tthe blue squares were also vertical but I thought it was too straining on the eyes as it looked like it was a continuation of the top white lines so I had to change the direction of the squares and make them look thicker to show the difference.

| Reflection:

I was most excited for this project reading ahead in the briefs! The main issue I struggled with was getting down a solid pixel idea for my images. There were little to no limits on what I could apply to my pictures which is awesome but made it hard because I didn't want to make a very basic/classic looking pixel image I wanted to be more unqiue with my design but I didn't know what I could do. The way I ended up with my idea was just through experiments which is quite unsual because I usually have a sketch and plan of what I a going to do before I start.
The fun part of this project was watching the code generate the pixel design and apply it to my images because the rendered image doesn't look like a photograph anymore. My favourite image would have to be the duck because it looks cute and it seems like it's just chilling on water. I primarirly used the duck photo to code the different pixel layers. The top and bottom images also turned out great and compliment each other. The way I ordered the images was purposeful too because the duck had the least amount of colour so it would look the best in the middle.
Although I do like my outcome, I think I couldnt have experimented with different shapes a little bit more. I focused mainly on circles and squares because I wanted a tidy pixel design and I was clinging onto the code I had already typed up. In the end it is all good because my final code was short and simple which is what I have come to appreciate more. It was a relief not having to control so many numbers and variables.

If I were to choose another theme I would be really interested in attempting ingame screenshots because sometimes you aren't able to get those types of shots in real life.
