## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

### Vincent Van Digital

Considering this project, I thought about our perception of the world, and this reminded me of photographics project I did where I used Vincent Van Gogh as inspiration, recreating to the best of my ability some of his recognisable paintings in photos at various locations around Wellington; creating a modern take on an old theme. I felt this project gave me a great opportunity to further this, by modernising the photos I took even more by having them being painted digitally too.
Thus I selected three of my best photos, that were most similar to the paintings, and attempted to create a custom pixel and mask that in some way evoked his art style. I did this by creating a mask that would rotate the 'brush stroke' based on the brightness of the photo through a grayscale mask that had had an 'oil paint' filter applied to it to add extra texture, and a recursive function that created slightly lighter, darker, and discoloured edges to these strokes, much like how paint can change on the edge of a brush, especially with this particular style.
If I was to start this project again, I would certainly look into driving the custom pixel with a bezier or curve instead as to better capture the actual brush strokes Van Gogh used.

| 10/06/2020 | I realised I should link the original paintings I was emulating with my photographs. <br> In order, the images taken are: [Starry Night over the Rhone](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/starry-night/uQE3XORhSK37Dw) - [Starry Night](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-starry-night-vincent-van-gogh/bgEuwDxel93-Pg) - [Country Road in Provence](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/country-road-in-provence-by-night-vincent-van-gogh/4wEXP9j2v6hpYw) <br> I have continued work on my code as well, including fixing the errors, thanks to Lucy and Michael, and now the recursive calls add a slight lighter and darker edge to the strokes, helping to sell the paint strokes in my opinion. Additionally, a slightly different shape is drawn for different light levels (though still individually rotated based on the 'brightness' of the mask). I am still playing with the size of the brush strokes as it still feels little too blobby to me which isn't exactly emulating Van Gogh's style. <br> I've slightly brightened the sky of 'Starry Night over the Rhone' to better match the other outputs. I also did final tweaks to the way the strokes were drawn, adding in more randomness to the recursive factor in order to make the strokes less similar, and attempt to simulate the way paint colours can change when painting in this style. If I was to do this project again, I think I would start with bezier or curves in mind as I think that could better lend itself to the flowing lines of a typical Vincent van Gogh piece.					   |
| 09/06/2020 | My design strategy has slightly changed. As I am basing my images off of Vincent van Gogh, I knew I wanted to emulate his brush strokes in some way. This meant to me that each pixel, or failing that, area, needed to have some form of movement to it. This meant my mask needed to be a little more detailed than just solid colours, so I looked at the "Oil Painting" filter in Photoshop and thought if I desaturated the original image, that could still be used as a mask, and the 'brightness' can be used to dictate the rotation of the custom pixel. Playing with mapping and referencing Van Gogh's work, I decided that the brighter the spot, the closer to 90° the line should be, additionally the pixel itself is a line that is shorter and slightly fatter the darker it is, and thinner and longer the brighter it is (according to the mask). In order to make just one line rotate and not compound on each other, I had to use push/pop with a translate, replacing the origin of the canvas with the pixel location, and drawing the line at the new origin. One issue I am currently having is that due to the way the recursion	is functioning, there are a lot of errors in the console due to the color() function and my modification of it at each 'level'.							  |
| 08/06/2020 | Today I started modifying the code to actually create my custom pixel. I have an idea to try using recursion to create it, but will need to set aside more time to investigate that. I have also attempted to create a more detailed mask of input3, and upped the vibrancy as I felt it was lacking some colour. Updated purview_helper as well to hopefully fix that issue.	  |
| 03/06/2020 | I had an idea to use my photos that are based off Vincent van Gogh paintings, especially if I'm able to create a painter-ly effect with my custom pixel. Spent today formatting the photos and creating the 3-tone masks for them each as each image has a fore/middle/background. Have yet to touch the code but will be doing that over the next few days.						  |
| 27/05/2020 | First tests with Project 3. I knew that I just wanted to try working with a screenshot I took in Elite: Dangerous a few weeks ago of a sun. I also figured, I could just desaturate and slightly modify the levels to make it an appropriate mask, and the end result turns out pretty okay. At this time I haven't looked into anything else too much.								   |
