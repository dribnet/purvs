## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html).

These are my final rendered images. I took the photos around the Aro Valley community centre. Over lockdown, I had no choice but to stay in my flat as I wasn't able to return home to Australia. I chose to take these photos and choose the theme of community, something which I have grown to appreciate even more over the past couple of months.

In terms of the work I've done throughout this project, I'm happy with how it has turned out, however of course there are things that I wish I could have spent more time on or explored further. The main thing that I would have liked to explore further was creating almost a grid of pixels with the image. As I was sick for quite a while, I wasn't able to go into campus and use the Media Lab computers, and my laptop that I have at home wasn't able to properly render the code and produce an image without the page crashing.

The first image is of the community centre itself, and I created a mask that highlighted some of the details of the building like the posters and the entrance. This image used the most complex mask of all three.

The second image doesn't really use a mask, as I decided that the colours of the Free Store were complex enough as it is. I used a sort of cross hatch effect, which I think works as the colours sort of blend into each other while still remaining very vibrant.

The final image is of a section of the community garden. There are a lot of textures in this image, and I wanted to manipulate that a bit. The mask I used on this image is abstract and geometric in nature. Using different sized squared in this image kind of created texture within the image according to the mask, which was in contrast to where the texture originally was in the image itself.

All in all I am happy with the images I have produced, however as I stated above, as per usual there are some things that I would have liked to develop further.
