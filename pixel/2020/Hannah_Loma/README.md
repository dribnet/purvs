  My theme is highlighting the details of a plants leaves - accentuating and appreciating the beauty of nature. I've always gravitated to nature when I'm seeking inspiration, especially when I need inspiration for my industrial courses. I wanted to focus on the leaves and their details in general, because of how diverse and complex each plant is. These three plants are called the Calathea Makoyana(Peacock Plant), Fittonia Albivenis(Nerve Plant), and Hadera(Ivy).

  I have experimented using Phoebe's code and looked at a past students code in how they used layers. The experiments I have conducted include grids, line textures, arcs textures, masks, and colour. All of these combined has shaped and created my final outcome as I have gathered pieces from all of my experiments.

  I have used the grid for my second layer. This grid is used in my grey and black masks, and are made up of circles and lines. The grid has helped make the plain white background of my images look more interesting - balanced the whole image also. Using the grid has helped attract the users eye to the leaves in focus. I like how the grid makes the images look more lively and playful due to the abstract appearance contrasting with the realistic detailed leaves. Somehow, the grid reminds me of Japanese Comics or the Nintendo DS Pictochat drawing style.

  I have used lines and arcs to add texture and to draw the images. Using the arcs helped make the image look softer - more evident in the experiments than in the final outcome. I'm glad it turned out well because I needed my images to look as detailed as I possible, as it related to my theme. I have also added a function that draws a small square over the white mask. These small squares in my opinion gave the leaf details have more depth, further supporting my theme of highlighting the leaves details.

  Colour was an important part of my design as it helped attract the eyes to certain parts of the image. I have slightly adjusted the plants vibrancy and hue so that it balanced well with the grid colours. The main colours I have highlighted are green, pink, and blue. I think these colours worked well together to add a good amount of contrast and balance. The main colour green I have added more vibrancy to using arrays. The pink I have used as a secondary colour mainly found in the background. While the blue is used as an accent colour, to give more life to the image.
