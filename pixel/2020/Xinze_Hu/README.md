## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
My theme is “Unforgettable scenery I saw on the tour.” I put three of the unforgettable photos that I took in traveling. The unforgettable scenery exists in memory. I will beautify the memory because I like it. There is a certain difference between the scenery in my memory and the scenery in reality. So I paved the whole picture with lots of small rectangles. These rectangles make the picture slightly blurry but allow the audience to see the general shape. The rectangles also make the pictures hazier and more like the one in the memory. I would forget some details with time passed, so I add crosses into the pictures. These crosses represent the forgotten details. I hide these crosses behind the rectangles，because I find details I forget when I think carefully.

I choose the theme is Personal and I want to share my unforgettable scenes when I travel. These three photos are my favorite photos. Also, these scenes impressed me so hard to forget. I edited the size of the photos and start to do the masks.
Try to edit the sketch.js, but meet some problems. Index.html doesn't change when I change the sketch.js. Confusing. I will figure out tomorrow.

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.
