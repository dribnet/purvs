## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Final Design

For my initial process, I wasn't fully focused on a theme, I found it really useful to explore the code and the capabilities that the code has to offer. I found this very helpful in my design process as I wasn't going in and limiting what I could create. My initial idea was based around embroidery. I liked the idea of overlapping strokes to create the shapes of the flowers but I wanted to see what function I could make to create this overlapping feature but not through opacity. I was able to achieve this with creating and using the different layers of mask that overlap the same shape of highlighting the flowerSize1

As part of my design process, I wanted to consider how I showed my theme of natural beauty. I did an experiment with creating a bright blue boarder. I thought it was an interesting effect but distracts from natural beauty. In the end I opted for using pixMod and darkening the stroke to allow for the colours to stand out more from each other

Overall, I am pleased that I went through the experimentation to find the stroke using pixMod and using arrays for my flower. It definitely improved my design by giving it some personal flare. I also have been able to use more complex code and of course struggle at the start but understand it so much better
