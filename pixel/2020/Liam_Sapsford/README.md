## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos from a trip to Japan I went on in 2015. The way I have designed my pixels is based on part of that experience. The blurry nature is because I was using glasses with an outdated prescription, and I wanted not only to show the photos I took, but also present an exaggerated version of what I was seeing in person at the time. The background part of the photo looks more painterly because of the scenic nature of the photos.
