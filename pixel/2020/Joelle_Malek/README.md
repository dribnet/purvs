## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel


Final Read Me, Summary

All three images were taken at Kerosene creek in Rotorua, one of my favourite places in New Zealand. It is a natural hot spring area surrounded by trees. My favourite thing about this place is that it is surrounded by trees, meaning the reflection of the water is green. Due to our current situation, travelling is limited to New Zealand only. I think this is a good reminder that although we are unable to travel over seas, there are still amazing places to visit in this country. Although I have been living in New Zealand for almost 8 years, I am still amazed by some of the things I come across. We should be more grateful of nature and places such as Kerosene creek which is free to visit!

I have used 3 different masks and effects to showcase the beauty of this place.

The black mask is linked to the drawStar2 function which draws 8 lines creating a star. Throughout the project, I thought this looked relatively messy. But by masking the right areas in the image, the messy effect worked well. For example, in the third image, the water looks very calm (due to horizontal lines), then crashes onto the rocks.

The white mask is linked to drawStar1 which draws 4 lines creating a star. I also added a slightly bigger stroke for green areas. This makes the green stand out and creates shadows (black/dark areas). I really like how it makes the bushes look like.

The grey mask is linked to DrawLines, which draws horizontal lines. I chose to use the grey mask for areas where water is. It makes the water look like it is flowing, making it easier to understand what is going on.

For some of the masks, I used a charcoal brush to blend in the water and the trees together. This is why in some areas, multiple effects can be seen.
