## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

I posted what I have so far in design feedback and the response was super positive! I was thinking of other ways I could perfect the work but honestly I think I'm done. I think to add more at this point would be needlessly over complicated when I have something I'm happy with. Now I just need to polish everything up and get ready to hand in.

As I have discussed in past readmes my basic them is looking at my room around me that I've been forced to spend a lot of time in and how I project my self into that space. I've been feeling a lot of stress in being away from home right now especially with everything that's been going on in the United States. It's been feeling like just me and my room a lot of the time. I like how I got this effect where it looks like the bits of me in the photographs are sort of warping the space around them which reflects that idea of my impacting the space around me. I used red as a predominant color within the composition for a few reasons, for one it is a color I use a lot of in my room, it's one of the colors in the American flag and it is often associated with stress. I really leaned into using the masks and colors other than those in my original pictures as I don't think I'm much of a photographer so I was really relying on the other elements to make the composition work.

I started the project just fooling around to see how everything in the code worked. I was just looking at drawing lines and using strokes and backgrounds in different ways. I was really not very interested in my first few experiments I just thought they looked really boring. That lead me to really try and make the masks more interesting. I liked incorporating the straight colors in the red background, I also used a black stroke in places and I thought all that made my compositions a lot more dynamic. I think I probably could have done some more interesting or complex things with the code it's self but why make things complex for complexities sake if there's no need. I think at first I thought my assignment couldn't be good if I didn't code something really flashy but I ended up liking what I got with pretty simple techniques. Some of this work was somewhat inspired by some pieces I drew a few years ago. In those I had outlined drawings of spaces in my house in pen and I painted my hands and face in places with watercolor. Unfortunately I don't seem to have any good photos of that work but it was looking at a similar idea of the space that we exist in and the process of using the different mediums of pen and watercolor was similar to the use of different masks.
