## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
Final Readme

It takes about 20-30seconds to load

For my Custom Pixel theme, I have chosen to do books, this is because I love to read in my free time as it is my way to relax and escape the busy world around us. Throughout this project, I was using a bunch of different books of size and colour, to show no two books are the same.
When I first started, with the books, I took some picture then started to play around with the code, figuring out the best way to show my theme. Though I liked the photos I took, I went and redid them, to try and get more contents in my images.
For the first image, I have it there is a stack of books, with a coffee, as I find lots of people especially I winter like to just curl up with a coffee and read a whole lot of books.
With the second image, I chose to go for the book being open, as though someone is reading it, then on the side a stack of books as though the next lot of books to read are ready to be read.
On the last image I have a book with a pair of glasses on it, as though they have jut put the book down to go and do something.
With each of images it shows, how different people are when it comes to reading, that we all enjoy reading in a different way.
For each image I have made it that the background it all the same colour, to help with the them, also because I found it was a bit messy with the different coloured backgrounds. I was able to reach this by having a fill and a stoke colour so the rectangles would become a certain colour, rather than picking up the colours from the image. To help give the image more of an effected I played around with the mask to get the best effect. For my mask I have three aspects, white, grey and black. Black is used for the background, and I have use the white and grey mask to show the different between the different books.
Overall, I found a bit changeling at first to figure the best way to represents my theme, though got there in the end. My favorite of the three images is the first one, as I find it best represents my love of ready, also I just love hoe it is all lays out and how the pixels all work together.
