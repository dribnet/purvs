## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My theme revolves around the values that friends teach you throughout your life. Each image displays those different sections: past, present and future. They have symbolic elements to them that represent the values in a more graphic way than just what the photo shows. It is a celebration of friendship and its importance to building our own personal character.

The first image displays the symbol of a dragonfly which means wisdom, change, transformation and the adaptability in life. These are all things that friends have taught me in the past, whether the friendships were positive or negative they are still of value and teach us all valuable things and shape us into the people we are today. This is personally my favourite image, I think the dragonflies are dominate but still subtle.

The second image displays a few of my friends and focuses on them with a symbol of a heart, that represents the care and love they have taught me and it the image represents something wholesome with no toxicity which is what they represent to me.

The third image is a collection of polaroid pictures together as a representation of memories that I want to build on and progress with, there are no additional symbols to this image because it did work in a visual way that I found strong enough, I think the subjects of the photos symbolise enough.

All the images are set in a natural environment with plants to represent human nature and the environment we set our friendships in.
