## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
FINAL README

Here are my final images. I chose to take my photos of books because I love reading! The books that are featured in all three photos are really meaningful to me and some of my favourites. I also love how their spines are so colourful and I display them on my shelves to show that. My rainbow shelf is one of, if not my favourite part of my room and is displayed facing my bed so I get to see it every day!
I took the photos of the books in various positions. The first was on the shelf, where they normally sit, also showing the other books around them. The second photo shows them splayed out on my bed. Initially this photo was going to be a photo of the stack itself, but I accidentally nocked them down, but they fell in a nice position so I took a photo of it, and it ended up being one of my favourites! It also seemed a bit repetitive to have the shelf photo and a stack photo, so this added a bit of variety. The third image has them all laying out in an arc shape. As rainbows are usually seen as arcs, i thought it was fitting to display them like this.
I was also inspired to use photos of books for this project by my friend Georgia.

The style of design I ended up creating for this problem set was a pixelated, sort of 8-bit style, that used 3 different layers. the first two were using pixels; the first being long and short ones, and the second square ones with a lowered opacity so that the layer behind would be able to be seen slightly through the second layer. The third layer was using the random with if and else statements to mask tiny lines and rectangles over the image to create a grainy or glitchy look to the image.

Overall I am very happy with how my images turned out! The images are quick to load as the number of random points is low.
I hope when people look at my images they feel happiness and joy as they are full of bright and fun colours, while also looking a bit different from the usual photos of books.
