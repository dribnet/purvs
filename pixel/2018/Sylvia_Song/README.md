## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Part 5 (Final):
This is my final version (elementSpacing in 5). In this project, I didn't use smartmask because all my photos have a simple structure (one peron per photo), so using photoshop is more convenient for me. Also, in this project, my theme is "Agains Violence". I want my artworks have strong contrast and strong visual impact. For the main character, the level of saturation and contrast are high. The other elements (hands, scarf) are in black and white. I also changed the curve adjustment of the hands show in artwork_1 and artwork_3 in photoshop, which increase the sense of powerful to hands. The shape I used in this project is a dark red square with a cross shape inside and a letter "V" in the middle point (more information in "Part 3" below).

Photos: In artwork_1 and artwork_3, I asked my models to use their eyes to convey their emotions even when their mouths are covered by hands. In artwork_2, I asked my model to do the opposite way, tried to use her mouth to express her feeling.

Part 4(2):
After listening to my tutor's advise, I devide to go for the elementSpacing of 5 or 4. Now I will render the input_1 and input_3.

I applied elementSpacing in 10 to input_1, 5 to input_2 and 2 to input_3. Just want to find the best scale for my project.

Part 4:
Tried the smart mask. It is a good tool but not really work on my project. Becasue my photos are simple and have some effects on them. So I think I will just use my original masks for this project.

Part 3:
I add the "cross" shape in my glyth:
	The cross patter: a square at the back, a cross shape inside the square with dark red (strong and impact color) and a "V" letter (represent violence) in the middle.
This shape will be applied on the black area of the mask. It means people can be suppress by the "Violence" (the eyes or mouths are covered), the way to against the "Violence" is to be brave enough and break the "cross". It's zero tolerate to violence (such as family violence) and people need to expose it bravely. The image in the middle (input 2) represent some people may not be the victim of violence but they also need to stop violence (or bullying) resolutely.

Part 2:
My theme is "Against Violence". I add three photos that I took and start to experiment them with grid layout techniques.

Part 1:
I fix the bug and added three random photos that I took. I got some idea: 

1, Cats Protect League
2, Artwork/gallery in wellington
3, Family Violence

But have not decide which one to go for.
