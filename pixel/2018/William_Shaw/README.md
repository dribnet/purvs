## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For this assignment I have created abstract images which depict rivers located in Aro Valley. The original photos were about the abstract portrayal of space, I have used my code to push this idea further. My custom pixel consists of two pentagons of different sizes which are mapped to a mask which follows the flow of the light and water.

My inspiration in creating the pixel for this image was sci fi graphics. I wanted to present the river as a "shape" which resembled some kind of sci fi creature. To achieve this look I cut out the shape of the water using a photoshop mask and used the code to make the pixels much denser and more defined in those areas.

To get to this stage of the design , I experimented with shapes and placement of the pixels. After experimenting with different shapes I decided sharp angled shapes suited the sci fi theme best and really like the effect pentagons created when put in a grid. They reminded me of distant lights when put in the background, and created an interesting texture when put in the foreground. The also created more complex shapes when overlapping which made for some interesting shading effects. 

I also experimented with the smartmask program to try and portray forms within the image, however the results ended up taking away from the overall image. I wanted to create something more abstract and liked the control photoshop gave me of the image mask.

My main challenge in creating this glyph was creating something I thought would look good at a large scale. I experimented with different pixel sizes, offsetting pixels and pixel shapes in order to find what looked best. I also wanted the image to have further details within it when looked at closer. Once I decided on the pentagon for my pixel shape I was much happier with how it looked on all scales.

I have also put time into refining my code to make it more readable and clearly labelling each section of code, as well as naming variables appropriately. 

Reflecting on this project, I am happy with my final images and think they would look in a public exhibit. I had a lot of fun experimenting with code and was grateful for the opportunity to experiment with both photography and coding. I think this would be a interesting idea to present to the public as it is a space they may have seen before, yet they wouldn't have seen it presented in this way before. The image is intended to intrigue the viewer and get them looking closer at it to figure out what it is, which would be good for a public exhibit.
