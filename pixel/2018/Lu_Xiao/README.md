## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel
theme for this project is Halloween in school, when I was high school student in Auckland, my teachers put on thier halloween clothes in school, so I take some photo for them, which I think is really interesting, so I used those photos for this project.

I used smarmask to make the mask for each images, and I changed the shpaes of the pixels.

the shapes was inspired from project 3 glyphs, and I try to make different mask for each images, which help me to make a choice for artwork.

I try to change the element spacing and square size to make the images more interesting.

for my final, the background was inspired from other classmates, and it worked very well.
