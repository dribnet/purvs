## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My roommates and their walls are quite interesting. Each of them have similar but distinct tastes that are echoed in the walls and clothing. The roommates themselves are easy to spot and visialise and they are on the edge of recognision, but there are small parts within that break the possibility of complete familiarity. 

The backgrounds are hard to tell with the spaes only being outlines and the colours being quite spread out. THhe gradient of size creates an almost steam effect where the squares almost look to rise up from the bottom, growing in size and density as it does so. 

I felt the theme of friends is well brought out here. With warm colours the evoke feelings of happiness and thw solid shapes against the hollow background creating feeling of familiarity and solidarity.
