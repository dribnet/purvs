## Final

Theme: 

My theme is 'Simple Winter' this theme enforces the idea that although Winter can be a tough time there are ways to get through it, and ways to enjoy it through utilizing the little things that get us through winter! Hence I have used three images that each present something that I find makes Winter just that little bit more bearable. All of the pictures have been snapped outdoors on a cloudy day to reinforce the winter feel

- In the first image you can see my flat mate holding a hot water bottle and a warm coffee, these are three things that make winter better:  friends, hot water bottles, and hot drinks.

- Second image contains my favourite beer 'Flame', nothing beats the winter chills better than an alcohol blanket and a good night

- In the third image you can see one of Winters greatest comfort foods, a bowl of soup with toast.

Code explained : 
each of these images has a small cluster of stars around the 'winter goodie' to emphasize that the item is a star amoungst the usually depressing winter months. I have also used a mosaic like look for the background, as I believe it reinforces the  'simple winter' theme, in particular the simple part of it. The mosaic effect was created by using the grid techniques learned in class paired with a simple black stroke on each of the squares.

I hope that when the Wellington public sees my work they are reminded by the hidden gems of Winter and that it can inspire them to embrace the hidden gems of winter and help them battle through it.
