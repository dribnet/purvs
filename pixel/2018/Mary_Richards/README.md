## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

-Test 

I browsed through pinterest to look for interesting photos to add to the code. I decide to look at the idea of travel. I made different landscapes and placed them all through an airplane window. I chose these images particularly because of their bold colours and the way they all show a gradient. I also wanted to look at morning, day, and night as you can see above. Pointalism seems to work really well with sky-scapes.
