Experiment in SmartMask

I tried to do something fun in the SmartMask. And I found there is a problem for this programming. Because there are two wine glasses in my third image. And when I run the program, it is not acceptable for it to use space for typing. So I used the numbers of the obejects to tell SmartMask to do the mask.
