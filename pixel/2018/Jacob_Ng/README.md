Emotions Puzzle Mask 

Theme -  Emotions determine personality 


My idea is to bring out the emotions more from individuals by rearranging coding, and mask them out with boxes and patterns/glyph to highlight different part of the face. Each boxes zoom in the place where they are, which can highlight the individual part I wanted to show such as lips, eyes and nose of that person. Photo 2 is the best example, I think the camera angles really helps bringing some perspective into the photos. My design was inspired by Joeri Booms from pinterest and I like one of his self portrait work that gives prominence to eyes, ears, mouth, and brain which represent the willingness to learn. Also I got some ideas from Chuck Close in class example,  where each squares has different patterns inside to gives extra details and to form the  shapes (especially the glasses). 

I have created a sun like glyph that has an ellipse at the center surrounded by 8 rectangles. I like how it overlapping each other and gives me the vision of mess textures in the boxes but not in random. I mask the boxes out in photoshop followed by the shapes of the character and keep the background clear and empty so that the focus point is all pointed into the characters. 

Photoshop masking - I have tried really hard to place every boxes carefully considered to the eyes, mouth, ears,and hair that could work nicely to through each other. 

Extra Note - I have an idea of an emotions app that could tell what your emotions and personality color is by the numbers of boxes fullfill in that person's face .
