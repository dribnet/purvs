##Final

My theme for this project is Samoan Language week. I wanted to capture the beautiful siva samoa from the performances that VUSSA (Victoria University Samoan Students Association) did for the SLW.

I only wanted to people in the photos to stand out to show the movement of the siva samoa also capturing their puletasi which Samoan woman wear. Which manifests bright colours.

I had troubles commiting my new work into my gist. But overall I really liked this project. It related back to who I am and what I am.
