## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

Final Submission:

For this project I focussed on the theme of having drinks with friends. I created a collection of images of my friends on neutral backgrounds that I thought would be perfect to manipulate with code in order to embellish or give a higher meaning to. For this reason I wanted to somewhat draw parallels from what it's like being drunk and what is seen visually. I began by seperating the subject from the background with a mask and began experimenting with smaller rectangles than the grid spacing code for the background to make it look less dense and push it further into the background. 

I began experimenting with a second mask for my subjects faces, I felt that everything was too same same for a large portion of my images and wanted to make them more dynamic while still being relevant to my theme. For this reason I decided to create a second mask to distort the faces of my subjects, which I feel is both another symptom of drunkeness and a potentially eye catching visual element. My first idea for this was to create larger ellipses within this mask, however with my current code this would only impact the horizontal resolution of the faces and didn't actually distort them enough to give the desired effect. I looked into changing the element spacing within the mask but this didn't seem to work the way I wanted it to either. I then decided to stray from the standard ellipses and rectangles and see what I could do with lines. At first I was looking at lines as a placeholder for the face and to be incoherant and messy, but decided to use them the same way as I was using ellipses but create a second point for each lines that was random between two values added to y and x. This added randomness created an interesting distortion effect unlike what I'd tried previously with ellipse size or random qualities added to x and y spacing. It created a messy and unique effect that was obvious even when rendered at a high resolution which was my ultimate goal.

Going back to the background I wanted this to be more dynamic as well, I experimented with creating a new y variable (y3) that causes a size increase of the rectangles the further down the page. What I found was the higher the number I divided y by to create this variable, the slower the shapes would expand. I created a random variable between dividing y by 100,000 and 100 so that there were constantly squares of different sizes but were all gradually getting larger further down the page.

As one of my input images contained a beer bottle displaying transluceny I had the idea to implement a third mask to highlight this effect. Within the mask the ellipses are smaller than they are within the first mask to closer match the size of the background rectangles, but not the same as the background in order to show some slight magnification. I also made this follow the backgrounds y3 element so the sizes are random but slowly get bigger. For my masks as they were so specific to certain regions of my images and not objects as a whole I decided not to use the smartmask. While experimenting I noticed that smartmask was a good tool for identifying entire objects, but would not have had the same effect for selecting a face within a body, or where specifically to add translucency to a beer bottle.
