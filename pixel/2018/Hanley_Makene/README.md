## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For my project I started with the idea of using lines to lessen the detail of a persons facial 
features. I started with straight lines going from pixel to pixel randomly this gave a creepy 
effect to the picture which gave me the idea to make the the lines look scratchy. 

For my final version, for the first pass I have a function that draws lines zig zagging from the 
pixel if it is inside the grey part of the mask which covers any skin in the photo.
The second pass draws the background as triangles of random sizes in a grid pattern.
the third pass draws the other parts of the person as lines stranding from the randomly selected pixel.

The three photos i chose are of my girlfriend in three locations that are a part of my life
in Wellington and in Napier where i am from.
