## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

In my final version, I did not use the smartmask. 

The reason of this because my concept is about water, the smartmask cannot help me to create the masks then I used Photoshop to do it.

The concept for this It want people to protect our water resources.

Frist image: I took from the water jumping place in front of TEPAPA. The water can bring us happiness. However, it also reminds us to protect the water resources about do not waste the water.

Second image: I took in a national park which in Canton, China. I want there is in the summer time, the waterfall creates very beautiful view and bring cool air around that place. It let me think about, it we do not protect our water resource we will lost the recycle cool air during the summer time. And the greenhouse effect will be getting worse and worse.

Third image: I took this image in Shenzhen MOCAP museum. It a sculpture of the ocean, made by metal. If we deep thinking about it, we do not protect us water resource in the next generation they have to look at the sculpture to know what it the clean water looks like. That will be a sad story for everyone. Also, the metal sculpture looks like a dirty water. We should keep our water clean and try our best to save it.

In this code, I use two masks in one image. I create the two line styles to show the water movement. The background pattern I used map to control the rectangle size from up to down, layout of irregular style.

The code is not difficult for me, but the final output Iâ€™m kind of satisfied with it.
