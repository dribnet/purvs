## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

For my custom pixel images I based mine around a tribute of sorts to my cats and the somewhat famous Mittens. The style I have done my images in is inspired from poly art styles where they use numerous triangles to show the image in detail while also keeping an edge of simplicity to it.
 In an attempt to get this through my pixels I have each point of the triangle on a random x and y to an extent. This gives the triangles more overlap and allows for a greater detailed effect. I have also seperated the cats from the background through the use of a mask. The mask is very effective due to the detail of the triangles and the sparce grainy nature of the squares in the background.
I have played around with a greyscale mask addition but due to both the theme, with the dark cats, and how nice and vibrant the poly art effect looks like in colour.
I have opted not to use the smart mask due to the deatil in the cats faces and especially their hair and whiskers. I tried using the smart mask but it wouldnt get that sort of fine detail.
Partway through the project I experimented with having two differnt grids of triangles drawn and turing them on and off through the mask. I tried this by creating different functions for each one but I couldnt get it to function anywhere near as well as I had wanted it to.
