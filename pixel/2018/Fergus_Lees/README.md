## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

My final consists of a mixture of images from this problemset, one of which is a grid based one and the other two have the swirly look. I did this as I felt some of the techniques I used communicated my intentions clearer depending on the image. When Gilbert was closer to the camera the grid wasn't neccisary to create shapes, when he was further away I used the grid as it gave shape to at least the landscape.

A thing I found surprisingly successful is how well the theme was maintained while switching colour palettes. I originally thought it would of fallen apart but it fits nicely all together. I also think this was a good test of my coding knowledge compared to the previous problem sets as I was dealing with a lot more random variables and at the end I feel I did well to control them.
