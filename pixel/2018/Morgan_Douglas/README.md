## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

These are my final images, I decided against using the smart mask as i found making the masks myself came out with better result for what i wanted to show. 

Theme - 
For my images I wanted to use a theme of inspiration and i thought back to what initaially inspired me down the path of design and this was street art. So i went around wellington and took photos of both graffiti and mural like paintings. In the end i decided to scrap the graffiti for a couple of reasons 1. i didnt think it would send and appropriate message and 2. most of it was Horizontal and didnt work well with my code idea. 

Code - 
For my code i really wanted to relate it back to my theme in some way and after playing around with it for a while i came across a randomgaussian pattern that i really wanted to recreate so i played with it for a but and the end result reminded of some of my favourite artwork to do as a child (crayon scratch paintings) which was some of the initial artwork that made me like the idea of doing design in the future. 

Overall im pretty happy with my images as the show the street art style that i was always inspired by growing up. From the start I really wanted to make the background quite flat and have the artwork pop off the page and i think the slight offset and colour and shape change really help the art pop.
